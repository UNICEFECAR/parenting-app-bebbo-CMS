**Project Description**

Bebbo is a comprehensive digital parenting app designed to empower
parents with evidence-based tools and guidance to support their child\'s
development from birth to six years of age. This app provides accessible
and culturally relevant content that spans critical topics like child
health, nutrition, safety, and tools including developmental milestone
tracking, vaccination schedules, growth monitoring, and personalized
tips based on a child's age and developmental stage. The app is
available in multiple languages and is open-source, ensuring equitable
access for families worldwide without compromising user privacy.

**Project Goals**

The primary goals of the Bebbo parenting app are:

1.  **Language Accessibility:** Many parenting apps are primarily
    > available in English, leaving non-English speaking populations
    > underserved. Bebbo breaks this barrier by offering content in
    > multiple national languages.

<!-- -->

2.  **Comprehensive, High-Quality Content:** Unlike apps with narrow
    > scope or those promoting specific products, Bebbo provides a wide
    > range of evidence-based, unbiased information covering all aspects
    > of child health and development.

<!-- -->

3.  **Cost Barrier:** Most parenting apps use a freemium model, nudging
    > parents towards paid subscriptions or courses. This creates a
    > significant barrier for marginalised users. Bebbo is completely
    > free, ensuring equitable access to quality parenting information
    > for all.

<!-- -->

4.  **Government Policy Alignment:** Existing apps often lack
    > customisation to local government programmes, especially regarding
    > vaccination calendars and health check-ups. Bebbo is uniquely
    > designed to complement national health initiatives, aligning with
    > local vaccination schedules and health guidelines.

<!-- -->

5.  **Data Privacy:** Many apps collect personally identifiable
    > information (PII) of minors and parents, raising concerns among
    > users and governments. Bebbo prioritises user privacy and the user
    > data will never be shared with any third party.

<!-- -->

6.  **Open Source Availability:** Governments are often hesitant to
    > include private sector apps in their programming due to vendor
    > lock-in. Bebbo, as an open-source Digital Public Good, offers
    > transparency and flexibility, making it more attractive for
    > government adoption and customisation.
