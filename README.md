## Multi-Site Installation Guide for Drupal

   This guide details the process of setting up a multi-site Drupal installation locally, with `bebbo.app` as the main site and `bangladesh` (accessible at `babuni.app`) as a sub-site located in the `sites/bangladesh` directory.

1. **Configure `sites.php`:**

   - Open the `sites.php` file located in the project root directory. `/docroot/sites/sites.php`.
   - Add a new entry for the Bangladesh sub-site in the file:
   ```php
   $sites['babuni.app'] = 'bangladesh';
   ```

2. **Create `sites/bangladesh` Directory:**

   - Inside the `sites` directory, create a new folder named `bangladesh`.

3. **Configure `settings.php` in `sites/bangladesh`:**

   - Create a new file named `settings.php` inside the `sites/bangladesh` directory.
   - Copy the contents of `sites/default/default.settings.php` into this new file.
   - Update the following settings in `sites/bangladesh/settings.php`:
   - Add database connection settings for the Bangladesh sub-site at the end of the file:
   ```php
   $databases['default']['default'] = [
      'database' => 'DATABASE', // Replace with your sub-site database name
      'username' => 'USERNAME', // Replace with your sub-site username
      'password' => 'PASSWORD', // Replace with your sub-site password
      'host' => '127.0.0.1', // Replace with your local databse host name or IP address
      'port' => '3306',
      'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
      'driver' => 'mysql',
      'prefix' => '',
   ];
   // Replace with your sub-site database name
   $config_directories[CONFIG_SYNC_DIRECTORY] = '../config_bangladesh'; // Point to the `config_bangladesh` folder
   ```
4. **Create `config_bangladesh` Folder:**

   - In the project root directory, create a directory named `docroot/config_bangladesh`. This is where you'll store configuration specific to the Bangladesh sub-site.

5. **Download and Import Database (Optional):**

   - If you have a pre-existing database for the Bangladesh sub-site, import it to your newly created database.

6. **Configure Apache (Optional):**

   - If you're using Apache, you'll need to configure a virtual host for the Bangladesh sub-site. This involves creating a new `.conf` file in the `sites-available` directory and enabling it in the `sites-enabled` directory. Refer to your Apache documentation for specific instructions. Typically, the `.conf` file will contain details like the server name (babuni.app) and the document root (path to the `sites/bangladesh` directory).

7. **Access the Sub-site:**

   - Access the Bangladesh sub-site by visiting `http://babuni.app` in your browser.
