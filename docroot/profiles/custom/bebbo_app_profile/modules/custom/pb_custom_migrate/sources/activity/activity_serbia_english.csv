7176,Helping Your Baby Self-Comfort,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Items you would usually put in or near your baby’s crib or other place where the baby is put to lie down. </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>It is still important to attend to your baby when he or she is distressed.  However, you will notice that your baby becomes better at calming him- or herself at least for a short while.  You can help your baby by making sure that safe items are nearby, that may help your baby self-comfort.  For example, is there a soft toy your baby likes to stroke?  Is there a colourful mobile or picture that is easy for baby to see?  Are your baby’s hands in a position in which he or she can suck on them if that calms your baby? Before immediately going to your baby, pause and look for a while to see if your baby is beginning to be able to make or keep herself calm briefly.   </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your baby knows that he or she can depend on you to make things better.  But your baby is also learning that she or he can do things to keep him- herself calm.  Self-soothing is an important thing to learn, beginning now but developing in the coming months and years.  As always, your loving support is essential. </p>",11801,yes,parent,,6431,2566,0,rs-en,published
7181,Keeping Baby Interested,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Only the usual objects or playthings your baby often likes. </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your baby cannot say “I am bored” or “I like this, please do not stop!” By observing how your little one behaves, you may know whether your baby might be interested in looking at or doing something new. Your baby might start fussing or turn away from something that he or she was interested in before. Or perhaps she or he just needs to be in a new place or position.  </p>

<p>Try a few things to keep your baby curious, alert, and satisfied. You know your baby best. Maybe a new object to hold will fascinate her or him a bit longer.  Or you might pick your baby up, walk around a bit, and look at new parts of the room. Or perhaps there has been enough “tummy time” and your baby wants to be on her or his back with something to look at. </p>

<p>You do not need to do something different every minute, but just pay attention to your baby’s signals and make some simple changes if a bit more, or a bit less, stimulation may make your baby contented and interested. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong> Even before your baby can move around or talk, your baby has ways of telling you what she or he needs. Simple changes in objects to look at or hold, or small changes in your baby’s position, will open the door to new learning opportunities. Over time, you’ll find out what works to give you time for yourself and your baby time for learning. </p>",12486,yes,parent,,6436,2586,1,rs-en,published
7186,Imagination Game,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Answer in some way whenever your baby grunts. Let it be a real little ""conversation"" - talk to the baby in a gentle voice, smile at them as you talk; while talking, take short breaks from time to time to give your baby a chance to get involved; at some point, the baby will start making simple noises. Speak in a high or low tone, try whisper and singing. Do this alternately with the baby. Repeat the sounds s/he makes.  </p>

<p>Place the baby face to face with you - the baby will watch you as you make those sounds. The baby in this position can watch you change your facial expression (big smile, outstretched tongue, wide eyes, raised eyebrows, puffy cheeks, or blowing). Observe the baby and if you notice that some of these expressions scare them, quickly change your facial expression, and after a while try again with a softened facial expression. Remember that every baby is different and reacts in different ways.  In this game, keep an expression for a while to give your baby a chance to try to create a new facial expression by watching and imitating you. Repeat what the baby does. </p>

<p>Another idea is to show the baby a rag doll, or just put a small sock on your finger. Say the baby's name as you move the doll or sock up and down like a puppet. Make sure the baby is following that movement. Then move your finger around. Every time you see your baby following the doll's movements, try a new movement. </p>

<p>These are very convenient routines while changing diapers, but also can be used in any free moment you spend with the baby.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>At this stage, the best toy - that fascinates the baby the most - is you! Your face, your voice, your hands, your body. Your baby learns to communicate with you and observes people's faces carefully and in detail, maintains long eye contact.</p>",10571,,parent,,6441,2616,1,rs-en,published
7191,Explore and Find Games,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Any favorite toys, diapers, scarf, paper towel, canvas bag or pouch, small plastic bottles, various seeds, and small items.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Play hide and seek items. Allow your baby to see you hiding the object under a blanket, diaper, or pillow. If the baby does not start to discover the hidden object, next time cover it partially. Help the baby find the item.</p>

<p>Loosely wrap a small toy in a paper towel or tissue (do not use tape). The child can unroll the package and find a surprise. You can also use some other soft paper or wrapping paper with cheerful colors that rustle. You can also wrap the toy in a thin napkin, cloth, or diaper. Another idea is to make a surprise bag that the child will find in the morning. Fill a paper bag or canvas bag with the following items or other similar items that you may have: a stuffed toy, something that makes a sound, a small plastic jar with a screw cap, or a book with cardboard pages. Encourage your baby to explore the ""magic bag"".  Make sure items are safe and supervise well.</p>

<p>Another idea is to play ""pretend games"" with a stuffed toy or a doll. Show and tell the child what the doll is doing (walking, going to sleep, eating, playing at the table). Use words to describe what the doll is doing, maybe give the doll a voice - anything that is fun for you and your child.  Give the child that toy and see if he will move the doll and do what you do.  You can take turns if your child enjoys that game!</p>

<p>Children like to play with objects that produce sounds and make noise. If you have time and have the materials, you could make a more complex rattle by stringing metal bracelets wide enough to fit over the baby's hand.  You could also fill small plastic bottles (with lids that children cannot open) with objects that sound different, e.g. marbles, rice, salt, grains of corn, etc.  If you do this, be sure to close the lids tightly for safety, and encourage the child to explore the sounds.</p>

<p>You can use this activity when you have some free time, use it for simple play with your child.  If there are older siblings, encourage them to play in a similar manner with the youngest member of the family.  </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong> your child starts to discover new objects or persons by touching and playing with them. These activities help to develop their fine motor and sensory skills.</p>",9246,yes,,,6436,2626,1,rs-en,published
7196,Floor Game,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A floor mat or blanket, favorite toys, rattles.  </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Position the baby so that you can touch his/her feet. Gently play with his/her feet and toes and gently tickle him/her. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, ""This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger"" for each finger. While the baby is on her/his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound.  Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.</p>

<p>On a soft flat surface, on the bed or blanket, while lying on her back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her - for example, ""Here is your hand; here are your fingers,"" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke her hands.  Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where she cannot reach it.  Does she try?  You might move the toy as the baby looks at it.  As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.</p>

<p>There are so many ideas for ""floor time"" as your baby grows!  Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his/her tummy so that his/her head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage him/her. The baby can stay in this position as long as s/he likes it, but make sure that his/her head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put favorite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.</p>

<p>""Tummy time"" is important for physical development.  Make sure the time your baby spends on his/her tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if s/he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As s/he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise her head and rise a little by pushing with her hands.  These motions will later grow into rolling and crawling.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These are excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment for your child. During these games, your child learns to explore and control the movements of his/her body and head. A baby may be able to raise her head and support herself with her arms.  </p>",446,yes,,,6421,2656,1,rs-en,published
7201,Look What You Can Do with Your Hands!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your baby is discovering his hands. She or he looks at them (what ARE they?) and also begins to be able to find her or his mouth with those hands. You do not have to teach your baby this skill, but you can encourage this new learning in many ways, every day. Make sure that your baby’s hands and arms are free to move for much of the day. Diaper changing, dressing, and bath time may be especially good opportunities for the baby. Often put your baby in positions that make it easy for your baby to see and control her or his arms and hands. Your baby may seem excited about discovering this “trick.”  Pay attention and share the satisfaction in making this connection. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This is an important step in your baby’s ability to control her or his movements of different parts of the body. It also develops the sense of touch and taste as your baby connects her or his mouth with those fingers.<strong> </strong></p>",12491,no,parent,,6436,2666,0,rs-en,published
7206,Search for Hidden Objects,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A few soft toys or things from home that are safe and attractive for the baby.  </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Put your baby on her stomach, on the carpet, or other soft surfaces. Sit so that you can see your baby's face and control her safety. Place several toys on one (left or right) side of the baby out of her reach but in the field of her vision. Wait for him/her to notice them or you draw his/her attention with a surprised tone of voice (saying: ""Aaaa, what do we have here?!""). Wait for your baby to roll over so he/she can reach one of the objects. If your baby does not try on her/his own, help his/her to roll from him/her tummy to his/her back so that he/ she can reach the objects. Encourage her/ him with an enthusiastic voice, a wide smile. When he/she stops being interested, looks away or protests - repeat the whole process with other objects, on the other side.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your baby has an opportunity to explore objects by looking, moving them from hand to hand, touching, putting them in his/her mouth.</p>

7211,"What Is It, and How Is It Called?","<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Various books, magazines, catalogs, signs, everything that contains letters and words or other symbols and that encourages talking and having interesting conversations.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Starting when your baby is just a few months old, quietly talk to the baby while feeding him/her, changing his/her diapers, holding him/her in your arms, or when he/she is next to you on the mat, or in the stroller. Although he/she does not understand all the words, even as a newborn the baby recognizes your voice, and it will please him/her. When you see your baby reacting to your voice, respond with warm smiles, caress him/her, etc.  If he/she doesn't respond, keep trying!  He/she'll begin to respond.</p>

<p>Read simple baby books or tell stories from day one. Even if s/he does not understand the story, the baby will enjoy your closeness and your voice. She/he likes to look at the pictures you show him/her. Read books written for babies or colorful magazines and at the same time show what is in the image and tell the baby about it. Let the baby pat the pictures in the book. Name everything s/he shows in simple words. </p>

<p>Books are important, but so is just talking with your baby about anything and everything.  When the weather is nice, take your baby for a walk in nature, even if it is just outside your home.  Tell him/her about everything you see. </p>

<p>If you do not have books around, you can also talk about things like the parts of the body, objects that you use every day, and people that the child knows. That way, s/he will understand that everything has a name and will gradually start learning those names. Name everything you do in your daily activities and routines. While naming things, show the object or what you are doing. ""Mom makes juice for the baby."" ""This is juice,"" you show the juice. ""Mom changes the baby's diaper."" ""This is a diaper"", and you show the diaper. Make sure the baby hears and sees what you're showing her. E.g. ""We are eating broccoli today, mmmm, how delicious "" and show the bowl.   These are not ""lessons"" but are enjoyable moments together as you introduce your baby to all the wonderful things in the world!</p>

<p>Whenever you have free time to play you can use the above examples in your daily routines (changing clothes, preparing for a meal, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Even if the baby doesn't understand you, he/she will follow the pictures, sounds, smells, and your voice. S/he will understand that everything has a name and will gradually start learning those names.</p>",11426,yes,parent,,6441,2731,1,rs-en,published
7216,Making Friends,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Your baby may cry in different ways and by crying he/she may try to convey different messages. During this period, you may notice that the baby begins to be upset when new, unknown people appear, which was not the case before. This is quite expected. Help him/her first by always introducing new people gradually and not abruptly and, if possible, in an already familiar environment. Always be with your baby when a new face approaches or addresses her, and if anxiety and crying increase - calm her down. Speak to your baby in a calm voice, holding her in your arms to reassure her that you will not leave her. You can gently rock her, hug her or sing to her. Watch closely to see when your baby is ready for the challenge of making friends again. You will know this when he/she looks around and explores things and people in his/her surroundings. Slowly try again to introduce him/her to new people, following her signs of pleasure and discomfort.</p>

<p>Every baby is different; your baby may be quite interested in new people, or she may be quite slow to warm up to even friendly strangers.  Follow your baby's lead and enjoy your unique little person!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your baby is learning to react to new situations and people, as her/his reactions will probably change from week to week.  If new people become part of your baby’s world, with your help your baby gets used to them gradually so that she or he feels comfortable. </p>",2646,no,parent,,6431,2761,1,rs-en,published
7221,"Mirror games: ""Nobody like me""","<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A large wall mirror, or a small unbreakable mirror (as a toy).</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>How to do it: Allow the baby to see herself or himself in the mirror. Place an unbreakable mirror next to the baby's crib or changing chair so the baby can see herself or himself on it. Start talking and tap the mirror to get her to look at it. Say ""Look, there is [your baby's name]"". After a while, the baby will realize that it is her/his reflection. Allow the baby to tap on the mirror and point the finger at himself in the mirror.</p>

<p>Look in the mirror together with your baby—smile and wave to him in the mirror. Smile and make funny facial expressions together as you look yourselves in the mirror. With lipstick or crayon, circle the place where your baby is reflected on the large mirror, encourage her to touch that place with his/her fingers and to stain the mirror with the hand, to explore and realize the changes. Follow everything the baby does with positive and encouraging comments, sounds, talk to the baby about what he/she is doing, what is happening, who is in the mirror, repeat the baby's name, and point to his/her face in the mirror. Repeat the same with your character in the mirror. Point to yourself, name it - it's mom ... this is ... (repeat the child's name).  As your baby gets older, you will see her/ him begin to recognize her name.  Use it often.</p>

<p>In front of the mirror, you can also play hide-and-seek games or ""where is [baby's name]?"" with the baby. He will always light up and smile when he sees himself and/or you again behind the scarf you are removing.</p>

<p>When the baby starts rolling or crawling on his tummy, play the ""come and get me"" game. Let the baby move a little, and you follow her and hug her when you catch her.</p>

<p>You can use these activities on all occasions when there is a nice big mirror in front of you, but also in other games on the floor, in the crib, on the big bed, while you are waiting in the doctor's office, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>These games are so interesting for the baby, while at the same time encouraging the development of an image of oneself, one's appearance, and place in the environment.</p>",9501,yes,parent,,6436,2776,1,rs-en,published
7226,"Saying ""No"" with Love","<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your baby is most likely beginning to crawl. This means that she or he is starting to explore all sorts of things in the environment—including things that may be dangerous. You may find that you want or need to tell your baby “no.”  How can you do this in a loving, effective way?  A few tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>“Babyproof” the environment to eliminate dangerous items that your child might reach.</li>
	<li>Use as few “no” as possible.  If you see your baby moving towards an unsafe object or place, distract or move him/her gently to another interesting item.  You might say “Let’s find something safe to play with.”)</li>
	<li>Use other words, not always “no.”  “Stop” or “Dirty!  Make you sick!” may get the same idea across.</li>
	<li>Because your baby won’t understand “no” at first, if you say it, move close to your child and, at the same time, explain briefly (“Ouch!  That can hurt you!”) and use a serious tone of voice. </li>
	<li>Make most of what your baby hears be “yes,” not “no”!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your baby needs to explore and move his or her body, but this has to happen safely.  You are helping keep your baby safe and teaching her or him, gradually, to avoid things that are not safe.  Your baby is learning to connect a word (“no” or “stop” or “don’t use that”) with an object or situation.  This is important for the development of thinking and language.  At the same time, he/she is learning to trust that you will keep him/her safe and will help him/her to find good things to do.</p>",12496,no,parent,,6441,2786,1,rs-en,published
7231,Reading with your baby,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong> A baby book (made of cloth or with a hardcover, brightly colored pictures, and tactile elements).  If you don't have one, you may use plain paper folded in half on which you can draw a few pictures or shapes in bright colors.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together:</strong> Put the baby on your lap so that you can look at the book together, but you should also be able to see your baby’s face. Place the book so that you can both see it and then read it! You can describe what is in the picture or tell a story about it, point your finger at the pictures, and name them. Use short and simple sentences. Vary the tone of your voice, be quiet, then be surprised…</p>

<p>Let your baby see your facial expressions, and you observe his/her reactions and name those that you see he/she likes or dislikes. Allow him/her to touch the book, put it in his/her mouth (if it is safe), and explore it in other ways. If the baby makes a sound while reading, allow him/her to ""read"" as well. Listen to him/her and respond by repeating her sounds, asking questions, and praising him/her. When you notice that your baby is no longer interested – he/she looks away or protests in some other way - patiently wait for his/her attention to return to the book and continue. If the book is no longer interesting to him/her, come back to it later. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Reading and looking at books together is important for your baby's communication skills and language development.</p>

7236,Safely Exploring Objects,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Items that your child plays with and explores, and two boxes.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>This is an exciting time in your baby’s life!  She or he eagerly, and more skilfully, explores all kinds of objects with his/her hands.  However, your baby also continues to put objects in her or his mouth.  It feels good, and it’s another way to learn about the world. Choking on or swallowing objects is a real risk.</p>

<p>There are things you can do!   For example, you might collect items that your baby enjoys exploring—toys and other items around the home—and see which are small enough to be risky if you are not supervising your baby closely. Perhaps you might put those in one box and leave them in a safe place where you can bring them out only when you are nearby. Other objects might be in an “Explore Box,” one that your baby can dump out, investigate, and mouth as much as she or he wishes.  Be sure to use language when watching or playing with your baby during object exploration: “Look what you found!  It’s a spoon. Oh, you are banging it!”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>At this age, the most important way for your child to learn about the world is by exploring objects.   What does this feel like?  Does this other thing feel the same?  What does it feel like in my mouth?  Is it hard? Soft? Squishy?  What can I do with this one?  Bang it?  Wave it?  By making it safe for your child to explore objects, you are supporting the development of your baby’s senses and strengthening her thinking skills. Your conversation brings extra value as you talk to your baby about what she or he is doing.</p>",12506,yes,parent,,6436,2826,1,rs-en,published
7241,On Your Feet - Walking Games,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Toys, larger cardboard boxes, a ball, or even clean socks rolled up into a ball.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>If the child is already getting up on his/her own in a standing position, put the toys on a sofa or a sturdy table  (that won't fall over) so that the baby can get up next to them and thus practice standing while playing with his/her toys. Also, find a large box in which the baby can crawl in and also come out. You might put a favorite toy in the box for extra interest.  Stay close and talk to your baby about what he/she is doing: ""You're in! And now you're out!""  You can also pretend the box is a ""wagon"" and push and pull it around the room.  This is especially fun for the baby in the winter months when going outside is limited.</p>

<p>Playing ball with the baby is another way to encourage walking. Roll the ball to the baby. Help the baby to roll the ball back to you. Depending on her age, the baby may even be able to throw the ball, so a small beach ball or some other softball is excellent for this game.</p>

<p><strong>You can use these activities </strong>whenever you have free time for games. Your child will signal when s/he is interested and motivated to walk; it is up to you to follow and support him/her.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This activity encourages your child to walk and practice walking if you roll a ball in front of the child.</p>",12511,yes,parent,,6421,2866,1,rs-en,published
7246,Who Is This Person?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>You may be surprised that, at this age, your child suddenly begins to be afraid, shy, or uneasy when meeting people she or he does not know.  Before, perhaps, your child gave everyone big smiles. This is another step in your child’s development.  It shows that your child knows and cares a lot about the difference between you—his/her special people—and everyone else.</p>

<p>When possible, give your child time to warm up to a new person.  Hold your child, talk easily to the other person, and by doing this you are comforting your child.  Rather than teasing or urging your child (“Don’t be so shy!), let him or her respond, or not respond, in any way that seems to make your child more relaxed.  If the new person starts to overwhelm your child with friendliness, you might simply say, “Let’s give her a bit of time to get to know you,”  again avoiding labelling your child as a shy or fearful child. Depending on the situation, you might give the new person a little toy or other item that your child may be curious about to “break the ice.”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This uneasiness with new people may last for quite a bit of time, but your child is learning two things.  First, he or she is learning that you are a source of reassurance and comfort in upsetting situations (emotional security).  Second, your child is learning that other people are often quite nice and may be fun to be with (social development).  As always, your support makes a big difference.</p>",12516,no,parent,,6431,2871,1,rs-en,published
7251,Separation and Comfort,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Objects that your child usually finds comforting.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>This is the age at which many babies become very distressed when parents or close caregivers need to leave them for a time - this may be just leaving the room for a few minutes, staying with a neighbour for some hours, or being at a child care centre during parents’ work hours.  Distress is normal. In fact, it shows you how much your baby is attached to you.  He or she knows you and depends on you.  Your job is to reassure your child and to be sure that your child has access to what might help during the separation.</p>

<p>Rather than sneaking away, talk lovingly to your child and assure her or him that you will be back soon and that you will take care of your child.  Your child may not understand the words but will hear your calm, loving tone of voice.  Many children are comforted by their favourite blanket, soft toy, or other objects.  Familiar routines (a bottle, a nap in a familiar place, etc.) also help.  Be sure the non-parent caregiver knows tips to reassure your child if distressed. </p>

<p>Be confident that this kind of reaction to separation will become less intense over time and, most likely, will disappear entirely.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>These are important steps in your child’s emotional development.  By giving your child gradual experiences with separation, she or he learns that you always come back (emotional security) and also that comfort can come from other people and experiences (coping strategies).  Your child may continue to be upset at separations for many months, but over time his or her emotions and thinking skills will allow greater success in managing these transitions.</p>",12521,yes,parent,,6431,2886,1,rs-en,published
7256,I Know It!,"<p> <strong>Materials You Need: </strong> None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child may not be saying anything, but she or he understands more every day.  It will be fun to notice all the names and actions that your child understands!  During all kinds of everyday activities, be sure to use words that your child is beginning to recognize — her or his name of course, but family members (you might say the name of a grandparent who is visiting, and notice if your child looks up to see the person, for example). What objects does your child know words for, do you think?  Again, you can mention “Where is your bottle?”  or “Let’s put on your shoes now.”  Say the word clearly and notice if your child seems to understand by looking at or picking up the object.  When you say “No” when your child is about to do something not safe, do you notice that your child reacts to the word?  As the months go on, see how much his/her understanding develops.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>These are important steps in your child’s development of language.  Understanding comes before speaking, and both of these skills develop more when you talk with your child about all kinds of things, every day, even before he or she can talk. </p>",12526,no,parent,,6441,2906,1,rs-en,published
7266,Where Is It? Bye-Bye!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need:</strong> A few small items or toys from your home</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together:</strong> At this age, your child is learning to “say” what he/she means by using her/his hands — gestures.  You may notice your baby doing this.  You can have fun with a little game to encourage your baby to use these kinds of gestures.  Begin by showing your baby a small item or toy.  Say, “Oh, here is your doll.  Where did it go?” (put the doll somewhere your baby cannot reach).  Point to the doll and say: “There he is!”  See if your baby points, also!  Then bring the doll back and do it again as long as your child is interested.  You can add another gesture by saying “Tell your doll “Bye, bye!”  and wave your hand. Guide your baby to wave also: “Bye-bye, doll!” </p>

<p>When your child uses gestures on her/his own (for example, she might point to some food you have prepared), you can say things like “Yes, you see the bananas!  Would you like to have some banana?”  You’re showing that you understand your baby’s communication.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child Is Learning:</strong> Gestures have meaning, and so using them is part of your baby’s language and communication development.  He/she is also learning that when he/she tries to communicate, you respond.  This is like an early conversation.  These connections also help strengthen your bonds with your baby and support social and emotional development.</p>",12531,yes,parent,,6436,2921,1,rs-en,published
7271,Handmade Musical Instrument,"<p><strong>Potreban mterijal: </strong>Ono što vam je pri ruci i može vam poslužiti kao zvečka, na primer prazna i oprana flašica ili kartonska kutija, zajedno sa materijalima koji u toj posudi mogu da stvaraju zvuke: suva testenina, pirinač, žitarice, stari tasteri , kamenčići, dugmići, kopče itd.

7276,I'm Dressing Myself!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Your child’s everyday clothing.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child may show interest in dressing (or, more often at the beginning, undressing) her- or himself.  Yes, it is more efficient to do it yourself, but spend some time giving your child a chance to “Do myself!”</p>

<p>Find times when you are not in a hurry.  It may be easiest to start with undressing at bath time.  For this and dressing, during this time of interest in dressing, try to choose clothes that are especially easy to put on and take off. You can also encourage your child to do the easiest bits, and perhaps just one item at a time.</p>

<p>Enrich this activity with conversation while you’re together.  Name items, colours, and so on, and describe what your child is doing: “Look, you have your arm in the sleeve of your shirt.  That’s great!”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Dressing one’s self is an important “self-help” skill that will become essential when school begins. It also builds your child’s sense of competence and independence. To figure out how to put on an article of clothing, your child also needs her or his thinking skills, to plan what to do first, which part goes where, and so on. Language and communication are also strengthened when you have conversations with your child about a task that is very interesting to him or her.</p>",12541,yes,parent,,6436,2961,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7281,I Play and Learn to Walk,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Favourite toys or handmade toys, pillows, soft furniture, boxes.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Arrange the furniture so that the child can move around the room and walk between individual soft pieces of furniture while holding on to the pieces of furniture. This encourages maintaining balance while walking. To encourage the child to take the first steps, when he/she is in a standing position and facing another person, encourage him/her to step towards that other person who is calling him/her holding a favourite toy or other objects (sometimes the person himself is a sufficient motive).</p>

<p>Children enjoy toys that are pushed and pulled. If you don't already have one, make a simple toy that is pulled by passing a piece of wool or a thicker knitting thread or a soft rope (about 60 cm long) through a box or a thread spool. Tie a ball or a plastic string at the other end to serve as a handle. </p>

<p>A large box can be a great place to sit and play. Children love to use large packaging as new small spaces in which they can fit and enjoy. Encourage the child to enter, get out of the box, or to sit in it... Make a bridge or a tunnel out of the box so that he/she can pass through it to the other side, where you or your favourite toy are waiting for him/her.<br />
Create terrain with some obstacles in the room with the help of boxes, small mats, pillows or pieces of soft furniture so that the child can move to overcome those obstacles, to roll over or to cross them, go under and through them.</p>

<p>The child learns that different toys ""do"" different things. Let him/her play with a variety of things that he/she can roll, push, pull, hug, shake, press, turn, stack, spin and mix. Most children enjoy listening to music. Encourage the child to move forward, around and backwards with the music, because that is how he exercises balance. If necessary, help him by holding his hands.  All of this supports his/her new walking skills.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This activity helps your child learn to move independently in different directions, at different speeds or combine different movements (to stop moving and wave). He/she is so motivated to master this skill that he/she will expect you to dedicate every free moment of your life to support him/her in mastering this so important life function.  Please do create the environment he/she is looking for!</p>",9251,yes,parent,,6421,2976,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7286,Say and Show Game,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong> Parts of your child's wardrobe, paper bags, magazines, or picture books.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Play a naming game. Name the body parts, objects you use every day, and people the child knows. That way, he/she will understand that everything has a name and will gradually start learning those names.</p>

<p>Make two puppet toys out of socks or a paper bag - one for you and one for the child. Have your toy ""talk"" to the child or her/his toy. Encourage the child to ""answer"", and to each of her/his answers you continue that game.  You can also use any small toys for the ""puppets.""</p>

<p>Play the game ""What is it?"" By pointing to parts of clothes, toys, body parts, objects, or pictures and asking the child to name them. If the child does not answer the question, you name the subject instead and encourage the child to imitate what you said.  Make this fun, not a test.</p>

<p>Create a picture book by putting plain, simple pictures cut from magazines into a photo album. The child will also enjoy looking at his/her photos and photos of family members. Pictures of pets are also favourited by children of this age. </p>

<p>Spread the child's clothes on the bed before dressing. Ask your child to hand you a shirt, pants, shoes, and socks.</p>

<p>Take two bowls (coffee cups or muesli bowls) that look the same and one small toy. Hide the toy under a bowl while the child is watching you. Ask the child, ""Where did the toy go?"" When the child finds it, ask the child. ""What is it? What's its' name?""</p>

<p>You can engage in these activities<strong> </strong>whenever you and your child chose to make time for it.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>All games and joint activities are an opportunity to encourage the development and learning of your child and to connect with the child in an emotional, cognitive and social sense. </p>",3316,yes,parent,,6441,2986,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7291,Coping with New People and Places,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is probably still showing some fear or uneasiness about new people or new situations.  At this age, however, your child has more ability—with your help— to find ways to begin to manage her or his feelings.</p>

<p>Find opportunities to give your child gradual exposure to new people and places. It may help to talk about this first, perhaps if possible, showing your child a picture (“Remember grandmother? We are going to visit her later today.”) or “Later you and I will visit Dr. Smith. Just like before, she will look into your mouth, like this” (pretending).  If your child becomes upset in a strange situation, you can help by recognizing the feelings (“Yes, I know you are feeling scared.  Sit here on my lap. Do you want to hold your teddy bear?”). After the situation ends, talk soothingly to your child and remind her or him of some of the ways your child coped: “I know you were a little scared, but remember what you did to make yourself feel better? (naming that)”.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Remember that your child’s fears about strange places and people are an important step in her or his development. It shows how close your child is to you, and that he or she knows the difference between situations that make him or her feel secure and those that do not.  With your support, your child is also building up “coping strategies” — ways that your child may begin to soothe him- or herself. Your child is beginning to see her- or himself as a capable person but also one who can depend on you and others for comfort.</p>",12546,no,parent,,6431,2991,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7296,My First Scribbles,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Piece of paper, some materials to draw or write (pencils, crayons).</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, most children cannot draw “realistic” pictures, but they love to make marks on paper — scribbling. A few months ago, your child may have begun to do this; now you can encourage scribbling even more. Give your child lots of time to do this by just putting a big piece of paper on a flat surface, with some materials to draw or write with.  Your child may pick up a crayon and start making marks. If your child has been doing this before, you’ll probably see your child quickly do this.</p>

<p>Let your child have time to use the materials any way she or he wishes. You can say things like “Oh, look how you have made so many marks with that pencil. I see a big circle here, and a long, long line there!”  If possible, you might tape up a few of your child’s “scribble drawings” where you and the family can admire them later.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These experiences are beginning steps towards drawing and writing. Your child is gaining more control of the small muscles in his or her fingers and hands. Your child is also beginning to make connections between what his or her brain is thinking (make a long, long mark) and what his or her fingers are doing.  Also, you are stimulating his or her language development when you use words to describe what your child is doing.</p>",12551,yes,parent,,6441,3001,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7301,Playful Bath Time,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Bath toys or a few plastic cups or dishes.   </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Since every game is an opportunity to develop, use bath time to encourage thinking. Take a few plastic glasses and explore the cause and effect together: when the glass is full of water - it sinks when we push the glass with our hand - it sinks and floats, when we pour while holding the glass high, and so on.  Depending on his/her interests (follow his/her lead), show these or similar things to your baby while he/she is sitting in the tub.  As you do so, describe what's happening (Oh, look at the cup; it's going down, down in the water. There it goes!"").  Encourage various types of movement and encourage your child to enjoy them by smiling at the child or praising him/her every time you see them experiment with something new. This will also encourage your baby's motor development.  Bath time also gives your child a chance to show many different emotions-excitements, curiosity, maybe upset as he or she must finish the bath, a bit of fear if the water seems too cold, and so on.  Notice and enjoy your child's growing ability to express feelings of all kinds.</p>

<p>Every bath can be an opportunity for this type of activity, but in a similar way, you can support your baby's exploration with various materials such as sand, gravel but perhaps also dry rice or any other material.  Be aware of safety; babies love to put things in their mouths, as you know.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>For a baby, this world is still an unexplored place, and in this activity, s/he can slowly understand how things are interconnected and develop understanding and logic. With your help, bathing gives him/her a lot of opportunities to understand how things work, while also having a lot of fun.</p>",10576,yes,parent,,6441,3011,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7306,Search for sound,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Just as children love to search for treasure, they are happy to go in search for sounds. All you need to do is to start the habit of stop and listening well in order to catch all the sounds in the room or around you. Stay quiet for a bit and encourage your child to do the same.  Say something like ""shhhhh, let's hear what sound we can catch"" and then point to your ears. You may hear pounding, whining, creaking, rattling, scratching, chattering. Encourage the child “Let’s see if we can collect the sounds we can hear. I can hear the clock ticking, the bus passing, the neighbor arriving by elevator.”  Use lots of interesting words like that - even if your child doesn't understand them yet.  </p>

<p>If the child is older, you can also ask the question ""Where could I find this sound?"" (And then imitate it).  Let s/he enjoy the feeling of discovery and making the connection between the sound and the object that makes it, by naming it. In that way, the language will connect with the concepts and enrich the vocabulary as well. </p>

<p>You can use this activity in practically every life situation - during free play and free time, but also during daily routines - dressing, preparing meals, hygiene routine, shopping,  walking, driving, and (if local health requirements permit) waiting for the bus or for your turn at the bank, post office, or at the doctor.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child is looking forward to activities with you and as you play together she imitates facial expressions, gestures, and some activities of close people, points with her index finger to what interests her/him, or offers things to other people in order to interest them and involve them in the game. This activity builds his/her vocabulary and knowledge of the world. Let your child explore the surroundings and tell you what s/he hears, even with babbling or simple words.</p>",9261,no,parent,,6441,3021,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7311,Treasure hunt,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>An ordinary box or a plastic container, shredded paper (newspaper, paper towels, or other paper cut into strips), small toys, or other small objects (safe for a child) that you have around your home. </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Put the objects or toys in the box together with the shredded paper so that the toys are hidden from view. Attract your child's attention with a friendly facial expression saying, ""Look what I have! Treasure!”, and then ask her to try to find the hidden things. Give him/her a simple instruction, “Find a...” or “Where is the...?”. Allow him/her to touch both the paper and hidden objects and to enjoy exploring. When he/she finds one of the precious items, always name the treasure ""And here is the..."". Follow the child's reaction and describe what you see, ""You like it!"", ""You want to find more!"", or praise his/her success. Support him/her if he/she wants to say what he/she found. Continue until all the treasure in the box is discovered. Vary items or toys that you hide to allow for variety in learning, but also to help your child to acquire a wealth of different words. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child learns to communicate and imitate the gestures that adults make and the words they say. Adequately your child uses gestures in response to requests.</p>",3186,yes,parent,,6441,3016,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7316,Can You Use This?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Everyday items that your child is familiar with (such as a comb, a spoon, a toothbrush, a small broom, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is showing that he or she understands what different objects are used for. Your child learns this by watching others in the family, and also by being encouraged to use these objects her- or himself.  You can help! For example, when dressing in the morning you might give your child the comb and say, “You can comb your hair!” (perhaps demonstrating or gently guiding your child’s hand) “Yes, that’s the way to do it!”  Try this with other everyday objects. If you see your child trying on her or his own, encourage your child —“Oh, you are trying to sweep the floor with that broom.  Big girl/boy!”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Knowing that objects are used in certain ways routinely is an important step in your child’s thinking skills.  She or he is making mental connections between an object (a toothbrush) and its typical use (cleaning teeth) - a big step for a baby. At the same time, you can enrich your child’s language development by using words for everyday objects and actions. Have fun together!</p>",12556,yes,parent,,6441,3006,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7321,Let your child lead the game,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Whatever you see a moment when your child shows play interest.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>All you have to do is follow everything your child is interested in at that moment. It can be a toy or something in the environment, like a bird or a fire truck, food, or some object from the environment. </p>

<p>Start by noticing what your child has noticed. It could be something to play with, like a ball or a movement like jumping through puddles. Name that item or action! ""Aaaa you took the ball!"" Ask your child how you can join, and then get involved in a way that is acceptable to them. If the child throws you the ball, you can return it. Focus on the activity itself, not the result.  Don't worry about whether the activity is completed or ""done well."" Avoid interrupting the child's play or changing the way the play naturally takes place according to the child's idea. If it is safe, allow them to manage the play, while you fully accept the guidance of the child.  It's great to ask or comment on what you are both doing - for example, ""It was a fast ball, I dropped it! You got it very quickly.” Give your child time to respond. </p>

<p>If your child changes the game to something new, let him/her continue to be the leader. For example, if he/she stops rolling the ball and starts playing with sticks, switch to using the sticks with him, naming that action as well, including commenting. </p>

<p>You can use this activity in practically every life situation - during free play and free time, but also during daily routines - for example, when preparing food at home or at bath time (""Oh, I see that you are pretending to drive that car around the table.  Zoom, zoom!"")</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child proposes to lead “pretend” games and these activities develop your child’s creative thinking and problem-solving skills. Your child also learns to communicate and reason.</p>",376,,parent,,6431,2811,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7326,Imitation,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None.    </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>For this activity, you may use all the free moments when you are face to face with your child - such as changing diapers, etc. Attract your child's attention by asking ""What kind of face does a … have?"" and then make a specific facial expression, for example like a fish: suck in your cheeks and move your pursed lips like a fish or, for example, like a bunny: twitch your nose like a bunny… There can also be different facial expressions - angry, sad, scared but also head movements – nodding, turning the head from side to side, hand movements - patting, waving… Wait for your child to look at your action long enough and try to imitate it. Be patient and repeat a movement or facial expression. Give your child a short instruction she can understand - ""Come on, you try it!"" or (if your child is a bit older), ""Can you open your mouth like a fish?  Let me see!""  and thereby encourage him/her. When your child repeats an expression or movement, always name what he/she did, because in that way you will encourage speech development. You should also imitate your child’s movements or expressions and give them a name. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>You will be helping your child to follow very simple directions, an important step in the development of your child's thinking, speech development, and socio-emotional development.</p>",2711,no,parent,,6431,2981,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7331,Ball in the basket,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>One softball, but rolled-up socks can also be used; a large box or a washbasin, or a large basket.  </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Place the box or basket in the room and position yourself at a short distance from it. In order to attract your child's attention, you can be the first to throw the ball in the basket and accompany this with happy cheers.  Stand close and make it easy.  When he/she gets interested, let him/her try it him- herself. For some children during this period, the expectation to throw the ball into the basket can be too demanding. Even if they aren't successful in throwing into the basket, the value and enjoyment of this activity is in practicing the throwing movement. Reward each attempt with praise, a smile, applause, and encouragement. Try to take turns throwing (you can say ""Now it's my turn!  Now it's your turn!"" and other language such as ""That was a big throw!"" or ""Oh, the ball went onto the couch; let's get it!"") and cheer for every attempt regardless of success. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child develops gross motor skills and movement coordination by imitating your actions. A child also learns the concept ‘my turn’ by playing with you.</p>",3191,yes,parent,,6421,2956,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7336,Watching and Playing Together,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A few interesting, safe playthings or materials from indoors or outdoors</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child probably is becoming more interested in being with other children. Your child may not be ready to play with others in complicated games, but he or she may enjoy playing side-by-side with another child, watching what that child does, and just being together.  To encourage this, if possible, find another child of about the same age in the neighbourhood or perhaps in a park.  If not possible, perhaps a brother or sister can be the playmate. </p>

<p>Get your child settled with the other child, with a few playthings nearby (enough for both to use).  You might give each child a few things and say something like, “Look!  You can play with these.  See, your friend is banging the spoon on the pan.  What can you do?”  The children may do many things, probably not together, but you may see that they are very aware and interested in each other. Help them enjoy relaxed playtime in whatever way they wish.  Watch them for safety and perhaps provide a few more materials or show how something might be used.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This is called “parallel play”—when very young children begin to play near each other, but mostly each child is doing her or his own thing.  They are learning by watching others, and sometimes copying what their friend is doing.  This is the very start of cooperative play and friendship, which will be so important in later years.</p>",12561,yes,parent,,6431,2946,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7341,Children love to talk to adults,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Children enjoy talking to adults. Whenever you have the opportunity, initiate the conversation by repeating the sound your child has produced (whether it is a word, an exclamation, or an indefinite voice) and then wait to see if the child will imitate and repeat it again, and thus start the first-step conversation among you. Then you can introduce some more sounds or words, and with a smile or verbal encouragement invite them to participate - for example, ""Muuuu"", ""Cow says muuu"", ""Come on, say muuuu!"" Always support and praise the child's participation, and then explore further words when possible - as the wind sounds, as the rain sound, as the river sounds, as the water in the bathroom sounds, as daddy's slippers sounds, as the kindergarten door sounds...</p>

<p>You can use this activity in every life situation - during free play and free time, but also during daily routines - dressing, preparing meals, hygiene routine, shopping, walking, driving, waiting.  Also, be sure to make conversation an important part of your daily book-reading:  ""Oooh, what is the girl doing?  What do you see?  I see the dog; I wonder what he is saying?""</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong><strong> </strong>In communication with you, your child learns to use a combination of words and enrich her/his vocabulary while exploring words with you. </p>",10586,no,parent,,6441,2891,1,rs-en,review_after_translation

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child’s language is developing rapidly. You are giving your child many opportunities to use sounds and words at home.  More and more, you are able to understand each other!  If possible, give your child chances to communicate with others, whether grandparents (in person or in video calls), neighbours, or shopkeepers. Gradually, your child may try to say things to these grownups. You help by asking your child questions — for example, “Oh, here is some fruit. What fruit shall we buy?”  If your child responds with some words, repeat or say a bit more, and connect with the shopkeeper. This kind of experience can happen in many different ways.  It’s exciting for your child to begin to communicate and be understood.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is developing language and communicative skills.  She or he is also becoming more confident in social situations.  Your support builds his or her sense of security and comfort in new situations.</p>",12566,no,parent,,6441,2876,1,rs-en,review_after_translation

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>As your child gets older, she or he will naturally begin to prefer to use one hand more than another. You do not need to teach your child this. Instead, give your child many opportunities to use his or her hands in many ways. One game is just to put some small objects (anything that is safe) on the floor with a basket or small box. With you nearby for safety (because children put small objects in their mouths), encourage your child to put objects in the container and take them out.  You can do it too, saying things like “Here goes another block into the box. And here goes another one.  It’s your turn!” </p>

<p>It will be interesting to notice, over time, whether your child uses both hands the same way or whether he or she prefers to use one hand more.   You might notice also when your child is outdoors, perhaps picking up sticks or leaves, or at home as she or he picks up a spoon or a cup.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Experiences with handling objects are all part of “fine motor” development—skills that later will help her or him hold pencils for writing.  Everyday experiences are fun and important.  This activity can also strengthen language development if you name the objects being used.</p>",12576,yes,parent,,6421,2816,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7361,Up and Down Together,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child may just begin to try to climb stairs (in your home or somewhere else if you do not have stairs). You can make up a little song as you stay close to your child as she or he tries to go up or down. For example: “Here we go up-up-up.  Here we go up the stairs. Mama (or Papa) and me together!”  You might put a toy or other small object on a higher step to keep your child’s interest in climbing.  You can put your hand on your child for security, stand on the next step or encourage from behind your child, always staying close enough for safety.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is strengthening her or his physical coordination. Your child is also growing in security that her family will help her or him to learn new things and stay safe.</p>

7366,Pretending to Say Goodbye,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong> A story for you to tell, either from a storybook or one that you create yourself, or puppets, dolls, stuffed animals, or other objects that you can use to pretend.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child may seem less upset than when your child was younger, when you leave him or her (for example, to leave your child with a grandparent or babysitter, or for your child to attend a child care program). One way to help make your child feel more secure is to tell a story or “play pretend.”  For example, you can read or make up a story about a little girl or boy whose mother is leaving to go to the market. The child will be cared for by a neighbor. The story can include recognizing that the child is not happy, but perhaps the child waves goodbye, sits on the lap of the neighbor, finds a game to play, and is happy when Mama comes back. </p>

<p>This kind of story, or a different one, can also be played out with dolls or other pretend materials.  You can ask your child things like “What can the little girl do to feel better?  Can someone help?” </p>

<p>Of course, you can also help your child become more secure about separation during everyday experiences.  When you leave, be sure to tell your child when you will come back, tell him or her how your child will be cared for in your absence, and give some ideas for how your child might spend time while you are gone.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>All these experiences will help your child to become more emotionally secure and be able to regulate her or his emotions. Your child is learning how to cope with distressing experiences. He or she is also learning how to think about the future and how to plan.  </p>",12586,yes,parent,,6436,2781,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7371,Me and My Friends,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Simple playthings or outdoor materials; A safe, well-supervised place for a small number of children to play together</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is beginning to play together with others of her or his age—not just side by side but starting to do things together. If possible, bring a small number of children together, at first for short playtimes (unless your child has had many opportunities in childcare programs). In some locations, public parks are good places to find a few playmates, health restrictions permitting.  Watch for signs of your child being interested in playing with another child. If they don’t seem to know what to do, you might make a suggestion or offer objects: “Look, here are two spoons, one for each of you. Can you dig a hole together?  Can you dig a really, really big one?”   It’s important to supervise for safety and to support children if there are conflicts. Remember that they don’t have a lot of words yet, and their social skills are at an early stage.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is beginning to enjoy social interactions outside his or her family. In school and in life, social competence will be important and will give her or him pleasure.  Your child will also need her or his thinking skills to plan what and how to play with other children and will develop a greater ability to manage or “regulate” his or her emotions so that the play can keep going.</p>",12591,yes,parent,,6436,2766,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7376,Sharing Feelings,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None<strong>  </strong>  </p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is showing many more emotions. Every day, you may see your child express excitement, sadness, fear or worry, etc. During these times, you can notice and name what he or she seems to be feeling: “You look so happy. I think you are excited to be going to visit Grandmother.”  Or, “I see that you are upset that we cannot play outside today. Let’s find something to play indoors until the rain stops.” Your child may notice others’ feelings. You can help your child even if he or she does not name the feeling: “Yes, you see that your sister is very sad. She is crying. Can you help her feel better?”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>When you notice, accept, and talk about your child’s feelings, she or he will begin to understand and express them more fully.  Emotional development is an important task at this age. Empathy for others is part of this, too. By helping your child notice and have concern for others’ feelings, you are helping your child become a caring person.</p>",12596,no,parent,,6431,2756,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7381,Getting Ready to Go Out,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>When you go outdoors (to play or go to the market, etc.), sometimes make a game out of getting ready. You can say something like, “Let’s get ready to go out. Can you get your hat and a ball?” or “Will you put on your sweater and open the door?”  Use two or three different tasks or directions, making it fun and creating steps to do before you do something fun together. Thank your child for doing these.</p>

<p>At other times during your daily routines, you can also help your child carry out tasks in this way — for example, when getting ready for sleep (“Please get your toothbrush and turn the water on.”)</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child’s thinking is improving as he or she learns to remember more than one direction at the same time.  Also, your child is improving her or his understanding of words and sentences, which strengthens language and literacy development.</p>",12601,no,parent,,6441,2751,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7386,Who Am I?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A photo of your child (this could be on your phone if you do not have one printed).</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Look at the photo together.  Say, “Oh, that is ___!” (your child’s first name).  “Who is it?  Yes, it is __!” (Your child can say her or his name or say it with your child.)  “You’re three years old!  You are a girl/boy!” You might talk about your child’s name, age, and gender in the same conversation or start with just the name and age —whatever fits with what your child knows and is interested in. Look at the photo, and perhaps others of your child, at different times, encouraging him or her to say the name, and age, and “I’m a girl” or “I’m a boy.”  Your child may also enjoy sharing this with other members of the family.    Without the photos, try also asking your child, “What’s your name?”  “That’s right, you are __!”)</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Knowing name, age, and gender is part of the development of your child’s identity or sense of him or herself.  </p>",12606,yes,parent,,6436,2711,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7391,Cloud Watching,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Get your child/children to lie on their back, get comfortable and simply let their eyes explore the sky. Make sure they know not to look at the sun. What cloud shapes can they see? Get them to count the clouds and think of ways to describe them. Are they fluffy, feathery, round, straight, heavy? Do they resemble anything, such as animals or cartoon characters? Are they moving and changing shape? As an individual activity, they could make colourful sketches of what they see. Or, if cloud-watching in a group, the children could take it in turns to tell a story about the cloud ‘characters’.</p>

<p>Cloud watching can be even more magical at twilight. Watch as the clouds absorb the colours of the sunset before fading into the night sky!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Taking time out to stare at the sky gives children a break from a sometimes hectic schedule, challenging feelings, or a rut of boredom. They can stop and learn to simply ""be in a moment"", a useful skill for self-awareness, emotional regulation, and wellbeing. Cloud spotting can also be a fresh source of creative inspiration for ideas, drawings, and stories. Just sit back and watch their imagination grow.</p>",12286,no,parent,,6431,2701,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7396,Family Songs,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>You have probably been singing with your child since he or she was a baby.  Now your child may enjoy learning to sing some of your favourites. To begin, sing one of the simple, familiar songs your child knows well. Encourage your child to sing part of the song with you. Perhaps the song has a chorus or simple repeating line. You can also stop singing that line and let your child fill in the missing words. The whole family can join in for a wonderful time together. You may notice your child singing parts of these songs on her or his own, while playing or perhaps as your child is falling asleep.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This kind of activity builds your child’s memory and thinking skills. She or he may also be learning new words from the songs you sing together.</p>",12611,no,parent,,6441,2686,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7401,Making a Pretend Meal,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>The activity theme (making a meal) is just an example. The materials can be different depending on the play.</p>

<p>Some unbreakable dishes, cups, and spoons; Places and objects your child can use for a pretend stove and fridge (might just be cardboard boxes or a table); Items your child can use for cooking pots or other utensils (safe and small; the item does not have to look exactly like what your child pretends it is)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, most likely your child is “playing pretend” often. This activity is an example of how you can encourage your child to make her or his play a bit more complex and get others involved.  At a quiet time, put out the materials for the play and (in this example) say, “Maybe it will be fun to pretend you are making a meal — would you like that?  Look, here are [etcetera].  What do you think you will make?” Continue by having a conversation about the pretend meal and providing or pretending to provide other items.</p>

<p>Then you can also say, “I (or Papa or big sister) can be your helper.  What can I do to help?”  Or others in the family can pretend to sit and eat the pretend meal.</p>

<p>This and other pretend scenarios can be played over and over.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child’s thinking skills are supported when he or she makes belief, pretending (for example) that a box is a stove or a small ball is an egg). Involving others in the play, whether family or other children, strengthens your child’s social competence and ability to cooperate.</p>

<p> </p>",12616,yes,parent,,6436,2681,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7406,Let's Look at a Book,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>One or more picture books (If you do not have, you can make a simple one by pasting magazine pictures onto pages and putting them together, or drawing simple pictures)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Looking at picture books is an activity that your child will enjoy at this age, if you share it with her or him.  As you read or talk about the pictures, encourage your child to turn the pages.  Make it exciting: for example, “Oh, let us see where the cat goes now.  Can you turn the page?” Demonstrate, and guide your child’s hand if needed.  You can say “Thank you for turning the page.  Now I see the cat is in the tree!” As your child becomes interested and able to turn pages, make this part of your everyday storybook reading. You may also see your child becoming eager to turn book or magazine pages independently.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>The action of turning pages is a new fine motor skill, using your child’s hands more skilfully. Your child’s thinking is also strengthened as he or she makes connections between what is on the pages and the step of turning to see a new picture.</p>",12621,yes,parent,,6436,5861,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7411,Making Bubbles,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>White or colored paper, pencils or crayons</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Your child will love to scribble or make marks on paper at this age. Often, simply give her or him a paper and a pencil and see what your child can do!  Circles are the first shape most children begin to draw.  A fun activity is to cover a page with bubbles.  You can say, “Let’s make bubbles!  Look, I’ll make some first.”  You can draw several circles on the paper and say “Now it’s your turn!  Where will you draw your bubbles? Oh, that is a big one! (or other interesting comments).  Do you want to use a different colour?  Look at how many bubbles we are making!”  Don’t worry if your child’s circle is not like yours. If your child is really challenged by this activity, you can gently guide her or his hand, or leave this activity for a later time and just have fun scribbling.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is gaining more control of the use of a pencil or crayon. She or he is observing carefully to try to make a shape similar to yours. Your child’s physical and cognitive development are strengthened by this kind of activity, and doing it together builds your relationship.</p>",12626,yes,parent,,6436,2651,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7416,Up We Go Together!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child may be eager to try to go up and down stairs (your home may not have stairs, but perhaps there is a place outside your home where you can help your child practice). Be sure to stay with your child as he or she tries to go up or down. Your child might crawl at first and then try standing up while holding on to your hand or a stair rail.  Encourage your child, perhaps with a song or chant: “Up we go together!  Mama and [child’s name] are climbing the stairs.  Up we go together!  Step and up! Step and up!” </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is learning to coordinate the movements of her or his legs and feet to successfully master a new physical challenge. If you add some counting to your song or chant (“One big step! Two big steps!” Etc.), you’ll also support his or her early mathematical development.</p>",12631,no,parent,,6421,2636,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7421,Animal Tea Party,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A blanket or sheet, teacups, plates, teapot (real food optional!), all of your favourite stuffed animals such as a Teddy bear</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Spread a blanket on the floor and lay out your teacups and plates around the edge of the blanket. Add your teapot to the centre of the circle. This part you can do with your child or set it all up to perfection and enjoy the look on their face.</p>

<p>Get your child to retrieve all of their favourite soft toys and invite them to the tea party. Organise the soft toys around the edge of the blanket remembering to leave space for yourselves. You can invite as many friends, with their own stuffed toys, as you like. The ‘tea’ is in endless supply!</p>

<p>Serve tea to all of your friends and let the conversation flow, ‘Thank you for coming Teddy, would you like some tea?’ Adults can help with the narrative if children are shy or worried about their ideas – there are no wrong answers, just let your imagination run wild!</p>

<p>This game is all about imagination, but a few cupcakes will never go amiss!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your kids will love inviting their stuffed animals to a very exclusive tea party! This is a classic activity that develops kids’ creativity, vocabulary and imagination through role-play. It also builds on kids’ social skills as they introduce you to all their favourite stuffed friends!</p>",12261,yes,parent,,6441,6971,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7426,My Special Helper,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Everyday objects or other materials used in daily life. For example clean folded clothes; toys or other objects your child has been playing with; spoons, unbreakable cups, or other objects from a meal; materials found in the garden, such as leaves on the ground</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Invite your child to “be your special helper.” Say something like “I really need your help putting these socks away. Some go in baby sister’s cupboard; some go in yours.  Can you please take these and put them away?  Oh, what a big help you are.  Thank you!”</p>

<p>This kind of activity can be part of your routines every day, with different materials and tasks. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is learning to cooperate, and that helping others makes your child and others happy. Your child is also learning to follow simple directions and learns the names of more objects. She or he may be learning how to sort or group things, also —for example, you could ask your child to find all the very little socks and put them in one pile and the bigger socks in another pile.  Make this fun and friendly, not a test.</p>",12636,yes,parent,,6436,6976,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7431,Animal Spotting,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Head outdoors to a place where children have the opportunity to spot different wildlife – the countryside or a local park, for example, or even the back garden. Ask children to look around – what animals and insects can they see? Get them to take a long look in different directions and make notes of their observations. Are there creatures in the soil and in the grass? On the leaves of bushes? In the trees? In the sky? They could explore different areas and habitats and compare their fascinating finds.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>A spotting activity requires children to be alert, focus and keep their concentration. By observing their surroundings in search of animals, kids will learn about nature in the world around them. Furthermore, in describing the different wildlife they see, they will be inspired to explore their vocabulary and learn new words.</p>",12246,no,parent,,6436,6981,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7436,Finding Two! Or Three!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Everyday objects that can be found around your home: spoons, articles of clothing, books or magazines, crayons or pencils.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Go on a hunt for “two” or “three” items together.  To begin, you could say, “Look at all the spoons.  Can we find TWO spoons?  Oh, here is one, and here is another. That is TWO spoons!” Then you can invite your child to find “two more spoons.” Put them together.  At a different time, something different, such as apples — “Let’s get TWO apples, one for you and one for me!” </p>

<p>Depending on your child’s interest and skill, you might find and count larger numbers of objects. Always make these items that your child is interested in and that have everyday meaning. The activity can be a part of a daily routine, such as preparing a meal — “Please find three cups, one for you, one for me, and one for grandmother.”  Sometimes your child might also enjoy drawing a picture of (for example) two apples.   You might also look for “two” or “three” of different objects in a magazine and, if it is an old magazine, cut out the pictures to paste.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Your child is developing her or his understanding of numbers—not just counting by memory but connecting those numbers with actual groups of objects.  By making this part of everyday life, you are helping your child become curious and eager about math, even at this young age.  At the same time, your child is understanding more about how objects may “belong together”— part of learning how to sort and classify. </p>",12641,yes,parent,,6436,6986,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7441,Imagine Your Bed Is . . .,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>As the kids sit on the bed, encourage them to think about what else it could be. Is it a steam train or an airplane? A speedboat on a rescue mission?! Where are they traveling to and what can they see?</p>

<p>They might hide under the covers and pretend to be witches in a cave, making a secret potion. Or perhaps they’re having a teddy bear picnic in the dark woods?!</p>

<p>For added fun, provide a few toys and props to help bring their adventure to life! Let their imagination run wild…</p>

<p>Turn the activity into a guessing game. Whilst one player (or players) is on the bed, the other tries to guess the imaginative scenario.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Children have boundless imaginations and can make a game out of almost anything! Why not try this activity on a rainy day?</p>",12016,no,parent,,6441,6996,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7446,What Happened?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None are necessary.  Sometimes you might want to start a conversation with something such as photos of something your child recently experienced (such as a birthday party), or an item connected with a recent experience your child had (such as some food that you brought home from the market after you went shopping together)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong> Every day, have enjoyable conversations with your child.  At this age, your child talks much more and probably loves to have your interest in what she or he wants to say.  At quiet times, you might encourage your child to remember and describe something that happened that day or recently.  You can start your child off with something like, “Oh, remember our visit to Grandmother’s house this morning?  You had such a good time.  What did you do there?”  Really pay attention to your child’s description (no phone!).  If she or he says something like “Ate lunch,” you could encourage more memories and descriptions: “Yes, what did you eat?  What was your favourite?” and “What else did we do?  I remember that you played with the cat.”   You’ll notice that your child’s stories about these kinds of activities begin to be longer and more complex as time goes on.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This activity is great for your child’s vocabulary development.  As your child learns and uses more words, he or she is building a strong foundation for later reading.  As your child tries to remember things that happened in the past, he or she is also developing his or her brain.  So important are the warm connections you and your child are making through these everyday conversations, sharing your child’s experiences and your memories together.</p>",12646,no,parent,,6441,7001,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7451,Singing Nursery rhymes,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong></p>

<p>Step 1</p>

<p>Sing a nursery rhyme to your child, such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’ or ‘Humpty Dumpty’. Repeat the song adding in clapping and smiling with your child.</p>

<p>Step 2</p>

<p>There are lots of fun nursery rhymes that can be sung in two parts (e.g. ‘Row, Row, Row Your Boat’; ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’). Infants at the speaking stage can be given their own line or lines to say once they’re familiar with the rhymes.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This activity is great for developing speech and hearing in young children. Simple rhymes help kids to pronounce words by building phonemic awareness through repeating difficult sound groups. The activity also encourages kids to become good listeners, as the rhymes often have a narrative, meaning children must keep listening to hear the whole story! Teaching your child when to sing their part in the rhyme is great for building social skills – such as turn-taking in conservation and listening.</p>",12651,no,parent,,6441,7006,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7456,Special Cards for Special People,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Paper (plain or coloured), pencils, crayons, or markers; any other materials that you might have, that could be used to decorate a card (pieces of coloured yarn to stick on, stickers, magazine pictures, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Making a card for a family member or other special person is an activity that encourages your child to begin to write a few letters of the alphabet or draw something simple.  This activity might occur because a neighbour has been sick.  “Let’s make a card to tell Mrs. Jones that we hope she feels better soon!”  Find a place to work together.  You can start off by asking your child “What do you think we should say?”  If your child has an idea, write it down on the card.  Then you could ask your child to write something, too.  At this age, it may be just a few letters or perhaps part of your child’s name.  You might print her or his name and suggest that your child copy it, or even one letter of the name.  Whatever the result is, praise it: “This will make Mrs. Jones very happy.  She will see what you wrote!  Would you like to draw a picture for her?”  Adapt this to your child’s level of skill and interest.  Make simple cards often enough that it becomes a routine activity (you might make a card to surprise your child, also!). </p>

<p>Shopping lists that you make together may be another way to encourage your beginning writer—you can write down an item and ask her or him if your child wants to write that word or write something else.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This is one of many activities that can help your child begin to learn how to write.  Your child is seeing that there is a purpose for writing and that it can give pleasure to others and be an enjoyable activity.  And of course, this activity encourages your child’s creativity, as you think together of how to decorate the card in a beautiful way. </p>",12656,yes,parent,,6441,7011,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7461,How to Make Playdough,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>2 cups plain flour, ½ cup salt, 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, food colouring, 1 to 1½ cups of warm water, bowl, mixing spoon.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Do you know how to make playdough at home? It’s cheap easy and a fail-safe way to have fun! You can customise it with different colours, glitter or even smells for a more sensory experience. Playdough is so versatile; it can be used for different learning experiences –– and never gets boring!</p>

<p>Step 5</p>

<p>If you’re making a few colours, scents or glitter dough, split the dough into equal parts depending on how many types you want. Add the dough to small sandwich bags and add a few drops of food colouring, scent or glitter. The more generous you are the brighter the colour will be. Knead the dough inside the bag so that you don’t dye your hands. Keep kneading until it’s mixed thoroughly.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>In this fun activity, your child develops fine motor skills by using fingers and hands more precisely. Your child is having fun and learning a lot with you.  </p>",11966,yes,parent,,6436,7016,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7466,"Your Turn, My Turn","<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Any simple game with rules, such as a card game or a board game, either purchased or made at home. For a card game, either use cards you have (perhaps fewer, with pairs of numbers) or make your own set.  You could just draw pairs of simple shapes or pictures (two birds, two cats, etc.). Any other simple game your child might enjoy indoors or outdoors.  This could be a traditional game from your childhood.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Play the game together in any way that your child enjoys.  You’ll find your child may follow some of the rules, but others are easy to forget.  That is all right!  As you play, you will take turns: “Oh, you moved your game piece three places.  Now it’s my turn.”  Or “Great!  You found two cards with pictures of cats.  Now it is my turn to pick.”  Use the words “your turn” and “my turn” often enough to give your child the idea.  You might ask “Whose turn is it now?  Thank you!”  Make the experience of playing a board game an enjoyable one, not emphasizing “winner and loser” but the fun of playing a game together. </p>

<p>Your child will enjoy any simple game if it is played with you!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>As your child gets older, there will be many situations in which he or she has to follow rules (getting in line at school, waiting for supplies to do a school activity, etc.).  This kind of activity is an enjoyable, gradual introduction to this kind of experience.   Turn-taking is an important step in children’s cognitive and social development, and this activity is one way to practice it.  </p>",12661,yes,parent,,6436,7021,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7471,Balls in the Box,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Some balls of different sizes (these can be softballs that you have made from rolled-up socks or newspaper); a cardboard box bigger than the largest ball.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Set up the game indoors (if balls are soft) or outdoors. Invite your child to try to throw a ball into the box. Begin by showing your child how to do it, and at first stand very close to the box. As your child gets better at throwing, challenge your child to move back further. Try this with different size balls. Your child will also enjoy doing this on her or his own.  If your child is interested, you can also count how many times he or she can get the balls into the box.  </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is developing her physical skills in this and other games. Your child’s learning how to control her or his movements to make accurate throws.  Becoming more competent at this skill helps build your child’s self-confidence. If you add counting to the game, your child will also improve his or her early math abilities.</p>",12666,yes,parent,,6436,7026,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7476,Where Can You Kick It?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>One or more balls (if you do not have the balls, you can make them from crumpled paper or rolled-up socks); A cardboard box larger than the balls; Other targets at which your child can kick a ball (for example, a stick laid down on the ground)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Invite your child to play a game: “Can you kick your ball?  Good!  Now let’s try something harder.  Can you stand here and kick the ball into that box?  (box turned on its side with the open end toward the child). Just use your feet, not your hands. Try again, it’s not easy!  Maybe you can stand closer.” Your suggestions depend on your child’s skill and interest.  You can make it more challenging: “Now let’s try something different. Can you stand here and kick the ball so that it goes all the way to that stick? Wow, that is good kicking!”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Now your child is developing more advanced physical skills. This and similar activities help your child learn to control her or his movements. Your child is also developing her or his thinking ability, as your child plans how hard to kick the ball, or what angle will be best so that the ball ends up in the box.</p>",12671,yes,parent,,6436,7031,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7481,Outdoor Chalk Drawing,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Giant pavement chalks</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Provide some giant chalks in a variety of colours for the children to draw with. They’ll most likely know exactly what they feel like drawing and where, but here are some ideas to get them started:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you have a paved driveway or patio, fill in each slab with a different color.</li>
	<li>Draw crosses on some paving slabs and only step on the slabs without crosses.</li>
	<li>Draw a Hopscotch grid together, then have fun hopping and jumping!</li>
	<li>Take turns to create wiggly mazes that lead to flowerbeds and pot plants.</li>
	<li>Lie on the ground and chalk around each other, then stand up and complete the picture by drawing the hair, face, and clothes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Encourage the children to draw out in the open air if you’d like the rain to wash all the chalk away for you!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning</strong>:  Drawing with chalk outside allows children to explore and feel a sense of freedom. It also helps little ones develop fine motor skills – perfect for getting them school-ready!</p>",12676,yes,parent,,6436,7036,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7486,"""I went to market""","<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>One player begins by saying, “I went to the market today and bought… [names an item].” The next player must add an item of their own, while also recalling the previous items said, in the same order. Players take it in turns to keep adding a new item to the list. Continue adding and recalling the items until someone makes a mistake –– then you can start all over again!</p>

<p>This game doesn’t have to be limited to the ‘market’! How about trying different variations like the beach or a desert island instead?</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This activity is a great memory test for kids as they try to recall items from an ever-expanding list. It’s a great social game for both small or large groups and is sure to build kids’ confidence in public speaking!</p>",12021,no,parent,,6441,7041,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7491,Act Out a Book,"<p> </p>

<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Ask the children whether they would like to think of their own books to act out or choose book titles that they’re familiar with from a hat.</p>

<p>Some popular choices might be:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em> (eat through all the food, spin yourself into a cocoon and transform into a butterfly)</li>
	<li><em>The Gruffalo</em> (feel the spikes on your back and the poisonous wart at the end of your nose)</li>
	<li><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> (roar, stomp and become ‘king of all the wild things’ before sailing home for your hot supper)</li>
	<li><em>Alice in Wonderland</em> (pretend to fall down the rabbit hole, sip from the ‘Drink Me’ bottle and shrink to fit through the door)</li>
	<li><em>Peter Pan</em> (fly to Neverland and sword fight with Captain Hook)</li>
</ul>

<p>The other players have to guess the title of the book and the first person to guess correctly takes the next turn.</p>

<p>For younger players, choose four or five books together and ask them to guess which one is being acted out. They may also like acting out their book with the help of a grown-up.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>This activity is perfect for building a child’s confidence and stretching their imagination as they act out their favourite storybooks. The other players must pay close attention to guess the name of the book – great for practicing listening and concentration skills.</p>",12681,no,parent,,6441,7046,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7496,My Address Song,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Your child’s name and address, printed in large letters on a piece of paper (for now, this can be just the street address)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Invite your child to make up a special song with you.  “This will be a special song with YOUR name and YOUR address—the place where you and I live!  We can sing the song together and sing it to Daddy (or other family member) later.”</p>

<p>Use simple words something like this, and put them to a familiar melody—anything at all:</p>

<p>I am Maria, I am Maria, that is my name, that is my name!</p>

<p>I live at 3 Lila Street, I live at 3 Lila Street.</p>

<p>That’s my address, that’s my address!</p>

<p>Sing the song together.  You can point at your child’s written name and address as you do so.  Repeat often as you do tasks at home or when you are walking together.  Your child will be able to sing it independently after a time.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Knowing one’s name and address is important as your child becomes ready for school.  Songs help children remember many things, not only name and address but letters of the alphabet and other information.  Memorizing a song also builds your child’s thinking skills, and creating a song together strengthens your relationship.</p>",12686,yes,parent,,6436,7051,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7501,Nature Counting,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Clipboard, Paper, Pencil.</p>

<p><em>Optional extra equipment: </em>Magnifying glass, binoculars.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Take your child/children outside to explore the natural world. What different kinds of plants and animals can they spot? Get them to stop and look in different places and record their fascinating finds – from up in the treetops to under rocks and stones. They can record their finds in different ways. Perhaps they could make a chart, keeping a tally of all the different plants they find? Or maybe they’d enjoy drawing and labeling the animals and insects they discover? Another fun option would be to introduce a memory game – challenge them to learn a list of the different animals/insects/plants/birds they spot and see if they repeat it out loud. For example, “Today I counted five ducks, three butterflies, one frog, two ladybirds…”. The most important thing is that they have lots of fun as they learn about the world around them!</p>

<p>There are more insects in one square mile of empty field than there are people in the world!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Getting your child to investigate, name and count the wildlife they can see is a playful challenge for their senses -– and one that reveals the impressive variety of plants and animals that live around them. It’s a great way for them to learn new vocabulary and improve their numeracy skills, too!</p>",12081,yes,parent,,6441,7056,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7506,Family Photos,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Family photo albums</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together</strong>: To younger kids who are used to digital photography, old family albums are a tangible way of teaching them about their family history!</p>

<p>Take some time to sit down together and look through old family photos, pointing out people they may know or recognise in the pictures. You may have a kitchen table full of albums or be snuggling over one or two special ones on the sofa.</p>

<p>Kids will love guessing the identity of children in the photos and may be surprised at how much Grandma or Grandad looked like them when they were little! Try finding photos of three or four generations of your family at the same age and compare them for likeness. You may need to explain that once upon a time, photos were only taken in black and white!</p>

<p>A fun activity is to find a family photo taken when you were all younger and try to recreate it today. Print out the photos and put them side by side – the results are sure to make you smile!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Dig out your old photo albums and gather round with kids, parents and grandparents to take a trip down memory lane. This activity invites kids to think about their family’s lives before they were in them while nurturing their emotional and social skills and sense of belonging. This activity also goes hand-in-hand with creating a family tree!</p>",12131,yes,parent,,6436,7066,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7511,Colour Hunt,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Small objects, each of one colour (such as a red sock or an orange)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Invite your child to play a “Colour Hunt” game. “Look!  Here’s a <em>red </em>sock.  Can you find some other things that have a <em>red </em>colour? Let’s look together!”  Explore different parts of your home or have the hunt outdoors. Use the colour word often.  </p>

<p>At other times, do the colour hunt activity looking for items of a different colour.  Include purple, orange, brown as your child learns more colours.  As he or she learns more, you might ask your child just to find items of a certain colour without matching—or ask your child which colour he or she wants to look for. </p>

<p>Besides this game, help your child learn colours just by using their names in everyday conversation (cooking: “Now I’ll peel those yellow bananas”  or dressing: “Let’s find your purple shirt to wear today.”)</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Knowing colours is an important part of school readiness.  Your child’s thinking is developing as your child learns the concept that objects may look different but have the same colour—and that similar items, like hats, maybe of different colours.</p>",12691,yes,parent,,6436,7061,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7516,Set up shop,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Various household items to be “sold” in the shop; Coins, tokens, or counters; Sticky labels; Pen or pencil; Calculator (optional)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Collect different items for the shop – this can be anything at all, from toys, books and DVDs to clothes, tinned food and fruit. Then get the youngsters to create price tags using sticky labels. How much would they like to “sell” each item for? Younger kids can use counters, tokens or even marbles instead of money (they just need something that they can exchange for “goods”).</p>

<p>Next, decide who will play the role of the shop keeper/s and who will be the customer/s. If playing with money, distribute the coins so that the customer/s can buy different items and the shopkeeper/s can give change.</p>

<p>The customer/s must decide what items they’d like to buy, taking into account how much money they have to spend. The shop keeper/s must then add up the total price (in their head, using a pen and paper or with a calculator), take the money and calculate the change.</p>

<p>The kids should take it in turns to play the different roles. Encourage them to choose different items to buy and sell so that they get lots of practice adding and subtracting numbers!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Play pretend is a fantastic way for little ones to explore their imagination, develop social skills and build confidence. Furthermore, playing shop gives kids the opportunity to put their arithmetic skills to the test and practice handling money.</p>",12696,yes,parent,,6441,7071,1,rs-en,review_after_translation

</div>


<p>Have a look at the equipment list and encourage children to start making noises with objects you’ve collected from around the house. The metal pots and pans will make the core of a percussion section. How does each ‘instrument’ sound when struck with either a wooden and metal object?</p>

<p>Step 2</p>

<div alt=""Illustration of Household orchestra Step 2"" data-embed-button=""media_browser"" data-entity-embed-display=""media_image"" data-entity-type=""media"" data-entity-uuid=""6f38118f-8d1d-4410-9eac-e031b424b136"" data-langcode=""en"" title=""household-orchestra-step-2.png"" class=""embedded-entity"">  <img src=""/sites/default/files/2021-05/household-orchestra-step-2.png"" alt=""Illustration of Household orchestra Step 2"" title=""household-orchestra-step-2.png"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" />

</div>


<p>Fill some different size glass bottles with differing amounts of water. Blow sharply across the top of the bottle’s opening and you will create a ‘whistle’. Use old milk bottles or sauce bottles, but glass works better. That’s your wind section sorted. You can also tap these (gently) and they will create a glass bottle xylophone.</p>

<p>Step 3</p>

<div alt=""Illustration of Household orchestra Step 3"" data-embed-button=""media_browser"" data-entity-embed-display=""media_image"" data-entity-type=""media"" data-entity-uuid=""78fccca1-3471-4615-8aca-748c89ae33d2"" data-langcode=""en"" title=""household-orchestra-step-3.png"" class=""embedded-entity"">  <img src=""/sites/default/files/2021-05/household-orchestra-step-3.png"" alt=""Illustration of Household orchestra Step 3"" title=""household-orchestra-step-3.png"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" />

</div>


<p>Stretch some elastic bands around a shoebox. You can experiment with cutting a round hole in the middle of the box, like a guitar. Different thickness bands will make different noises and smaller or larger boxes will reverberate the sounds differently. Experiment with your string section.</p>

<p>Step 4</p>

<div alt=""Illustration of Household orchestra Step 4"" data-embed-button=""media_browser"" data-entity-embed-display=""media_image"" data-entity-type=""media"" data-entity-uuid=""936b4852-9625-43fe-abc9-dbcd5b42bceb"" data-langcode=""en"" title=""household-orchestra-step-4.png"" class=""embedded-entity"">  <img src=""/sites/default/files/2021-05/household-orchestra-step-4.png"" alt=""Illustration of Household orchestra Step 4"" title=""household-orchestra-step-4.png"" typeof=""foaf:Image"" />

<p>Children can add to their orchestra using electric equipment (with adult supervision) that makes different noises. Whisks, kettles, vacuum cleaners and washing machines all make excellent background noise to your orchestral marvels.</p>

<p>Did you know that the word ‘orchestra’ comes from the Greek word meaning ‘to dance’? When you’re making music, make the time to dance to it as well!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Kids love making noise! Give them some time with no noise limits to explore the possibilities of different sounds. This activity will get kids thinking about how sound and music are made, as well as what makes the best, or loudest, sounds.</p>

7526,Jobs to Help My Family,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Paper and pencil, paper cut into strips; list of simple everyday tasks or jobs your child is able to do, one written on each strip of paper. Examples: put clothes in a laundry basket, get the mail and put it on the table, put forks and spoons on the table for breakfast, sweep the steps. (These will depend on your family life and your child’s skills).</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Talk with your child about how big she or he is getting. Invite your child to pick out a job she or he can do every day to help you and others in the family.  Read aloud some of the jobs written on the slips of paper (or ask your child to close his or her eyes and pick one from a hat).  Agree that this will be your child’s job every day during the next week, or whatever period you wish. You might change jobs weekly (Many preschools have classroom jobs)</p>

<p>If necessary, demonstrate how to do the job and give your child encouragement and reminders at first. Praise your child’s efforts, whatever they are. Be specific in your praise, not just “Good job!” but “I see that you wiped the table very carefully. It’s really clean now!”   Especially praise your child’s independence in carrying out the tasks.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is learning that her new skills are important to her or his family (and, later, to your child’s classroom and community).  Your child is practicing many skills that allow your child to help her- or himself (dressing independently, for example) and to participate in home life. This gradual, growing independence is a sign of positive development.</p>",12701,yes,parent,,6436,7081,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7531,Obstacle Course,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Cardboard boxes; Swimming floats; Garden canes; Blankets; Cushions; Soft toys; Hula hoops; Rope</p>

<p><em>Optional extra equipment: </em>Stopwatch</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Help your child/children make an obstacle course in the garden. Perhaps put a pile of different items – such as cardboard boxes, blankets, hula hoops, swimming floats, etc. – in the center of the garden, and have the children come up with ideas of how to use them. Which ones can they use to crawl under, jump over or go through? Which ones can be used to balance on their head as they spin around? Once they’ve designed their course and tried it out, they can have fun introducing different rules and variations.</p>

<p>Cardboard boxes and swimming floats are the best items to start with, but also think about how you could use stuffed toys, hula hoops, balls or even a blanket. Put everything in the center of the outdoor space. Build different obstacles in a large circle around you. Consider making one obstacle that you need to climb over, one you need to jump over, one you need to go under and one you need to go through. When you are finished, test your course! Use a stopwatch to time yourself and try to keep beating your best time.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>Building an obstacle course outside is a fun way for your child to get creative, active and, well, maybe a bit messy, too! All they need are household items that are light, easy and safe to move around – such as cardboard boxes and cushions. This playtime will feed their imagination, challenge their cognitive skills and get their muscles moving as they climb, run and crawl around the course.</p>",12086,yes,parent,,6436,7086,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7536,Fingerprint animals,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Washable finger paints / non‐toxic paints;  A shallow dish for mixing paint; Paper; Aprons or old clothes; A tablecloth; An old flannel.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Start by preparing everything you’ll need, both to get creative and to clean up as you go (especially with younger children).</p>

<p>Ask the children which animals they’d like to create. They might choose a cat, an elephant, a mouse, a turtle… or several animals to create a farm, zoo or rainforest scene!</p>

<p>Next, get the paints out! You could use a shallow dish to mix some paints together – perfect for teaching children how to make new colours.</p>

<p>Ask the children to press their fingers or thumbs into the paint and then onto the paper to create the animal heads and bodies.</p>

<p>Allow the paint to dry, then ask the children to draw on details, such as ears, stripes, tails – whatever they need to complete their fingerprint creations!</p>

<p>Older children might like to get even more imaginative with their fingerprints to create a whole scene, like a fingerprint sea around a turtle or some grass and trees around an elephant.</p>

<p>It can be difficult for younger children to resist the urge to smudge and swirl their fingerprints around the page. Provide them with an extra sheet of paper so they can smudge and swirl to their heart’s content!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning</strong>: Little ones never tire of getting the paints out! This creative activity allows children to express themselves with colour and detail as they make their favourite animals using their fingerprints!</p>",11891,yes,parent,,6436,7091,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7541,Family Interview,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Decide who’s first in the questioning seat and encourage your kids to ask them questions! Need some inspiration? Try starting with the questions below and see where the conversation takes you!</p>

<p>1. Did you have any pets growing up?</p>

<p>2. Do you prefer winter or summer? Why?</p>

<p>3. What’s your favourite meal?</p>

<p>4. Have you ever lived in another country? Would you like to? Where?</p>

<p>5. What’s your favourite song?</p>

<p>6. Have you ever broken a bone?</p>

<p>7. What was the last film you watched?</p>

<p>8. If you could go back in time and meet someone from history, who would it be?</p>

<p>Now encourage kids to think of their own questions –– they don’t have to be sensible! How about asking what animal they’re most like, or the food they would eat every day for the rest of their life? Have fun with it!</p>

<p>Make this activity more fun by encouraging your kids to pretend to be a red carpet reporter!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Inquisitive kids will be a natural at this activity, where they get to put their family (that’s you!) in the questioning seat! It’s a sure way to build on their social and communication skills and learn something new about you, in the process.</p>",12121,no,parent,,6441,7096,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7546,Animal Name Game,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>The first person starts the game by saying, “I’m thinking of an animal that begins with the letter …”. The other players then take turns to ask questions to try and identify the animal. They can ask any question, so long as the answer can only be “yes” or “no”. For example, does the animal have four legs? Does it have a tail? Is the animal a mammal? Can it fly? Once the animal has been guessed correctly, it’s time to switch roles. Want to make it harder? Don’t give the players the letter clue!</p>

Anything else to decorate the “Book About Me.”  For example, stickers, photos of your child, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Invite your child to make a special book all about him or her! Make the first page “My Name” — help your child to say and copy his or her name, first and last name, on that page.   Your child could draw a picture of her- or himself on that page or paste a photo. Then the next page can be “My Address.” Help your child to copy her or his address onto that page, doing some of it for your child if he or she is not yet able to write it.  Here your child can draw a picture of where he or she lives. </p>

<p>Then, if your child is interested, you can add more pages about her or him, such as “My Pet” (if your child has one), “My Favorite Food,” “My Brother,” etc.  Work together to write words and encourage your child to draw.</p>

<p>Finish by taping or stapling the book together.  Read it to others in the family!  Put it in a place where your child will find it and read it over and over again.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>For their own safety, it is important for children to know their full name and address if they become lost.  Knowing this kind of information also builds your child’s sense of identity and place in his or her family and community.  This activity strengthens your child’s literacy development — her or his knowledge of letters and words and the importance of reading and writing in daily life.</p>",12706,yes,parent,,6436,7111,1,rs-en,review_after_translation

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Arrange the chairs to resemble the inside of a bus – have one chair at the front for the driver, and a set of chairs behind for the passengers. The more chairs and players, the better the game!</p>

<p>Nominate one player to be the driver and get them to take their seat at the front and simulate driving. Encourage them to have fun acting out their role as they pretend to turn corners, stop at traffic lights, beep the horn etc.</p>

<p>The other players stand to one side at their imaginary bus stops, waiting for the driver to collect them. Every so often, the driver should ‘come to a stop’ and announce which stop they have arrived at – example stops could be the park, the town centre, the zoo, the library and the school. Passengers are then free to board the bus, take a seat and begin their journey!</p>

<p>It may be a good idea to establish a bus route before the game begins – this way passengers can decide on a destination, board the bus, alight and wait for the bus to return before continuing their trip. You could also have the passengers buy tickets or use tokens – this is a great way for kids to practise counting and mental arithmetic.</p>

<p>The main aim is that players have lots of fun exploring their imagination and putting their improvisation skills to the test! Where will they head to on their exciting journey…?</p>

<p>Be sure to probe for details –– what do you think it smells like 5000m in the air? What does it feel like on your skin? There are no wrong answers, the sky’s the limit!</p>

<p>Did you know that the world’s fastest bird is the peregrine falcon? These brilliant birds can reach speeds of up to 240 miles per hour!</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Find a flat, grassy area for the children to race, and decide where the start and the finish will be. Divide the racers into pairs. In each pair, one child is the ‘wheelbarrow’ and lies on their front on the grass, and the other is the ‘driver’ and stands by their teammate’s feet. Before the race begins, the driver picks up the wheelbarrow’s ankles and the wheelbarrow lifts themselves onto their arms. Then… ready, steady, go! The racers move towards the finish line as fast as they can, with the wheelbarrow walking on their hands and the driver holding their legs as they walk behind. Will they be able to make it to the end without collapsing from laughter?!</p>

<p>Let the wheelbarrow determine the speed –– not the driver!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This classic game requires kids to work in pairs, exercising their social skills as they wiggle and waddle towards the finish line together.

<p>Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-O</p>

<p>You can use this rhyme by including different animals, e.g. dogs, cats etc. Ensure your baby is looking at the rattle and see if it has caught his or her attention. If so, move the rattle to the side and sing the song again, so your baby can turn his or her head towards the rattle.</p>

<p>What you can see</p>

<p>Round, round, you will give</p>

<p>You alone will see!</p>

<p>When you see the object, your baby will try to reach it, move his or her head and stretch her or his arms. If your baby is very young, you will probably only see an attempt to move his or her head and arms.</p>

<p>Repeat this exercise in the morning and afternoon, and as the weeks go by, you can increase the difficulty. When you see that your baby can move his or her head and stretch her or his arms to reach the toy, gently hold her or his feet so that she or he pulls with greater force.</p>

<p>Remember that your baby is delicate, so you must take it with care to avoid hurting him or her. If you notice that your baby is tired, stop the game.</p>

<p>Strength and muscle tone exercises facilitate brain development which will help your baby to have greater control of her or his movements. By using a colourful object, you will be stimulating your baby's sense of sight.</p>

Another way to help your baby recognize his or her name, your voice, and the place of origin of a sound is to place yourself in different positions of the bed or crib and sing the song from there at the foot of the bed, near the pillows, on one side and the other. Sing with your little one's name until your little one can turn around to see where you are. Always end by saying to your baby, “I love you (little one's name)!”. And give a little kiss.</p>

<p>The ball rolls,</p>

<p>I will roll it to you,</p>

<p>If you were on wheels,</p>

<p>Then repeat the game, but this time follow the movement of the finger with your head. In this way, your baby will locate the sound and relate it to the movement. You can also alternate the tone of the buzz to maintain interest and develop the perception of different sounds.</p>

<p>Lastly, lay your baby on his/her stomach and repeat the game. This time the baby will not see how the finger moves and will have to wait for the ""buzz"" to reach his/her body.</p>

<p>Remember always to have a calm and smiling gesture that transmits a positive message to your baby. Your baby is very delicate, so you should always touch him/her gently, and the sound you make should not be too loud. If you notice that your baby is scared, start slow and quiet, and increase sound and interaction.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This fun game helps your little one start to have better control of his/her head and neck and develop the sense of hearing by locating sounds and getting to know his/her body through the sense of touch.

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Collect all the similar items (such as the leaves) in one pile on a table or the floor.  Create an atmosphere in which the child will be interested in them. You can say something like ""Wow, what do we have here - a bunch of different leaves ...!"" and use your curious facial expressions to arouse the child's curiosity. Allow them to explore them a bit, then encourage them to sort the items in different ways.  With younger children, you might just say ""Let's put some of them together.  Which ones would you like to put together?""  and then comment, for example, ""Oh, I see you put some big leaves together.  Shall we put the small ones together also?""   Older children might be encouraged to sort according to different criteria. For example, by putting ""Green paper clips on one side and red on the other"". Praise your child when s/he tries and talk as much as possible while the activity is taking place “Ah, you took the red one. You put it with other reds”. Resist the urge to fix what the child does - it is not at this age a ""mistake.""  Instead, just describe what the child is doing - for example: “Oh, a yellow one with red ones”. Depending on the age, you can offer the child smaller items or offer items whose differences are harder to notice.</p>

<p>This is easiest to do at home, but if you have access to outdoor space, you might collect leaves, seeds, or other natural objects and think of different ways to sort those.  </p>

<em>This little piggy had roast beef,</em><br />
<em>This little piggy had none.</em><br />
<em>And this little piggy went...</em><br />
<em>""Wee wee wee"" all the way home...</em></p>

<p>If you know other songs or rhymes to play with your baby, these types of games are an excellent opportunity to play and learn together. Remember that your baby is very delicate, so the strokes should be gentle, and the tickles should be few to avoid making him/her feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>With this activity, your baby will begin to know and feel his/her body, as well as have sensory pleasure. It will also help with language development, motor control, and social interaction.

7761,Bubbles,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Blanket, soap bubbles. You can also make bubbles at home with water, hand soap, laundry detergent, or dishwashing liquid; wire or tape; deep container.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>To do this activity, you must first prepare your bubbles. If you don't have bubbles at home, you can make some homemade ones.

7766,I'm Feeding Myself,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Small pieces of food that your baby enjoys; a place for your baby to sit with food in front of the baby.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>This is the age that many babies really begin feeding themselves. Your baby probably isn’t using a spoon yet, but fingers work, too! If you have not started yet, begin by putting some pieces of tasty food where your baby can reach them. He/she may immediately pick one up and put it in his/her mouth.  If so, show your excitement (“You ate that all by yourself!” or “Did the fruit taste delicious?”). You could also nibble a piece yourself, showing how much you enjoyed it. Or put one piece in your baby’s mouth and see if he/she does the same.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Depending on your cultural traditions and your child’s development, you may continue occasionally feeding your baby. However, encouraging self-feeding strengthens your baby’s coordination and skill in using her/his fingers. These are skills that, years later, help her/him beginning to draw and write. When you talk to your baby during this time, you’re also encouraging language development (names of foods, for example).</p>",12776,yes,parent,,6441,2936,1,rs-en,review_after_translation

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Show your baby the box, take off the top, and be surprised. “Oh, look what is here!  This is your special box, with special things inside. Let’s play with them!” Then you can demonstrate (if you need to) how to pick up the items, take them out of the box, and put them back in. It will be fun if some of them make sounds, like spoons. Let your baby sit and play in a way he or she likes, with you nearby. </p>

<p>Be sure to keep the box with the items in the same place, so that your baby can find the box and play independently at times.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These kinds of activities are helping your child to become more skilled in using the muscles of his or her fingers and hands.  Cognitive development improves, too, as he or she plans what to take out and put back, and how things fit together. </p>",12781,yes,parent,,6436,2941,1,rs-en,review_after_translation

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, many babies begin to be interested in standing up. You might see your baby pull her- or himself up from the floor to stand holding onto the couch or chair. She- or he’s getting ready to walk by her- or himself!  You can encourage this (although you may not need to, but you will have fun). Just put an interesting object on the chair, show it to your baby, and see if your baby tries to stand up, or move towards the object while holding onto the furniture. You can put the object closer or farther away depending on your baby’s growing skill in moving.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>These experiences help develop your child’s ability to stand and, eventually, walk independently. Her or his confidence and excitement will grow with your own interest and encouragement. Just be sure to stay nearby for those first wobbly steps!</p>",12786,yes,parent,,6421,2951,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7781,Stories with Feelings,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A storybook with characters (people or animals) that have many different feelings, OR an interesting picture from a magazine that you can make up a story about.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong> At this age, your child loves to look at books or pictures with you. He or she notices what’s happening in these stories, including that the people, or animals, are feeling different things.  As you read or tell the story, you can help your child notice these and express some of these feelings her- or himself: “The puppy is sad because he cannot find his mother.” (make a sad face yourself) “How does the puppy look?  Can you make a sad face, too?”   Or “I wonder what will happen next?  Let’s turn the page and see.  Wow, the little girl is so excited—it is her birthday.  Can you be excited like she is?”  You can explore many feelings with your child, using stories.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child’s emotional development includes expressing and understanding many kinds of feelings. Story reading and storytelling can help encourage this development. At the same time, reading every day develops your child’s language and early literacy—so important for later school success.</p>",12791,yes,parent,,6441,2971,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7786,I Do It Myself!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Your toddler is becoming more independent. That is exciting for both of you but has some challenges.  She or he may refuse to do what you want her or him to do, or she or he may want you to do things her or his way! This is a time for patience and some clever strategies.  When your child insists “Do it myself” when something is too difficult, perhaps you can encourage him or her to do one part of it, and then step in and finish while praising.  “Your turn” and “my turn” may help sometimes. You can also use your words to reflect your child’s feelings, such as “I know you want me to do it your way, but I cannot do it right now.  It makes you angry, but let’s find something else to do now, and we can try later.”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is learning to be independent and to express his or her own wishes. This is an important but not easy step in his or her development. Your patient support will gradually help your child manage his or her feelings of frustration and begin to understand other people’s needs as well as your child’s own needs. </p>",12796,no,parent,,6431,2966,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7791,What Does the Animal Say?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A book or books with pictures of different animals; pictures from magazines, advertisements, etc. with animal pictures; real animals if you have pets or live on or near a farm.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>With your child, enjoy trying to make the different sounds that animals make.  You can look at a picture of an animal, or a real animal, and ask your child “What does that animal (e.g. cat) say?”  You can make the sound first, or your child may know the sound and make it.  You can talk turns also: “I’ll make the sound of a ___.  Now you make the sound!”  Pictures will help your child connect the animal with the sound.    To make it a bit more challenging, you could first make an animal sound and then show your child pictures of more than one animal and ask: “Which animal makes that sound (for example, Moooo)?”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning:  </strong>He or she is beginning to connect real things (animals) with their sounds.  Your child is also making connections between pictures of things and the actual things they represent (here, pictures of animals and animals).  All of this supports your child’s development of thinking, language, and early literacy skills.</p>

<p> </p>",12801,yes,parent,,6441,2881,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7796,Playing with My Doll,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A doll or stuffed animal (can be very simple, made at home); a few other items like a small piece of cloth and a spoon</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child’s ability to pretend or “make-believe” is growing rapidly.  Many activities can encourage this kind of imaginative thinking. One idea is to spend time getting your child involved with pretending with her or his doll or stuffed animal. Your child may just pick it up and begin to (for example) pretend to put the doll to sleep. But if not, get started by saying something like, “Oh, your doll (or bear) is sleepy. Let’s put him/her to sleep.” You can begin, but let your child take the lead as soon as your child gets started. Step away and watch what your child does with the doll/stuffed animal and a few materials. You might comment on what he or she is doing, but you can also simply enjoy your child’s imagination!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>The ability to imagine and get involved in pretend play supports your child’s thinking skills and is emotionally very satisfying. Play is the most important way that children learn about the world in the preschool years. Every day, you can encourage your child’s make-believe play with simple materials and a few ideas.</p>",12806,yes,parent,,6436,2861,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7801,Look What I Can Do with This!,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Just some of your child’s favorite toys, or other simple items from your home (for example, spoons and pots, pieces of paper and a few crayons; small wooden blocks, a few pieces of cloth, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is still enjoying playing with objects. Now she does not just explore these objects, but she or he will try to use them for a reason. Just give your child some objects and watch what your child might do. For example, she or he might put all the spoons in one pot, or pretend to eat with the spoon, or pick up a toy phone and “talk” on it. Just watch and enjoy your child’s activities. You can also do something interesting with one of the toys and see if your child copies you or perhaps does something different. Give your child many opportunities to explore what objects can be used for.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This kind of activity strengthens your child’s thinking skills through simple everyday experiences. Your child is thinking about “What is this and what can it do?  What is it for?” He or she is learning, every minute!</p>",12811,yes,independent,,6436,2846,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7806,A Message for Someone Special,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Large pieces of plain white paper (or coloured paper), crayons or pencils.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Tell your child that he or she can make a special picture for (family member or friend). Be sure to say how happy the person will be to have something that you did all by yourself.  Then sit your child down with paper and a few crayons (larger ones are best at this age). If you need to, show your child how to make marks.  When he or she begins, encourage her/him: “Oh, look, you made a long, long line. Now I see you are going round and round!  What else can you do?” At this age, don’t expect something that looks realistic. Your child, with your support, is just experimenting.</p>

<p>When your child seems to be finished, you can write her/his name on it, fold up, and give to the special person. Your child may want to repeat the activity!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: “</strong>Scribbling” like this is the beginning of later drawing and writing. Your child is gaining more control of her/his hands and strengthening connections between her/his brain (what marks he/she wants to make) and her/his hands. By creating something for a family member or friend, your child is also seeing that “writing” can be used for a purpose (early literacy) and that he/she is making someone happy through her/his actions (social and emotional competence).</p>",12816,yes,parent,,6441,2821,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7811,Whose Is It?,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Any small objects</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Find a comfortable place to play. Say “Let’s play a game! Here is a [item, a small ball for example].” Give the ball to your child. Now say: “Now it’s [your child’s name]’s ball.  It is <em>yours!”  </em>Then say, [child’s name], please give Mama the ball. Thank you!  Now it’s Mama’s ball — it is <em>mine!” </em>Continue handing the item back and forth, making the exchange fun and using the words “yours” and “mine” together with your child’s name and your name. This is just a fun game, not a lesson. Enjoy the time with your child.</p>

<p>At other times during your day, remember to use words like “yours, mine, hers/his, etc.” as well as “on, under, over,” and similar words when you place or take items:  “Where is your blanket?  Oh, it is <em>under </em>the table.  Can you get it, please?”</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>At this age, your child’s language abilities are growing fast. Words describing ownership (mine) and position (under) are important tools for your child to express her/his understanding of the world. Everyday activities and simple games like this, book-reading, and daily conversations will all build your child’s language and communication skills.</p>",12821,yes,parent,,6441,2741,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7816,Making Food for My Family,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Anything you usually use to prepare a meal for the family, with simple ingredients; simple tools that your child can use to help (small bowl and spoon, plastic knife, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, most children love to be a helper, and preparing food is especially interesting.  Working together to make part of a meal also lets you help improve your child’s language!  As you work together, talk about what you are doing, using descriptive language that perhaps is a bit more complex than you might use at another time.  For example, you might say, “I need a different spoon now. Can you find me one that is different — not the same? Oh, great, that one is bigger! Now we will put the cake in a pan. I need a big one. See those pans?  Can you find a really big one?” You know your child’s language skills best.  Make your conversation fun, not a test, but a way to use interesting, maybe new words in an activity he/she will love to do with you.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>This kind of activity, with lots of talking together with doing interesting things, will strengthen vocabulary and general language development. Your child will expand her/his understanding of more complex words and phrases and will gradually begin to use these her- or himself. Be sure to continue to look at and read books together and to tell stories. Talking with your child during these times is also an important way to build her/his language and communication skills.</p>",12826,yes,parent,,6441,2726,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7821,Following Instructions,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A ball, a leaf or a flower, a child’s hat, etc.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Let’s go outdoors! Bring your child (and other family members if possible) outdoors to your garden or a park or other play area nearby. Encourage your child to use her new walking and running skills to enjoy exploring with your supervision. Then you can play a “following instructions” game. Give your child two things to do at the same time.  For example, “John, can you pick up the ball and throw the ball to me?” You might need to gesture or demonstrate once or twice. Praise your child for whatever your child does.  If two steps seem too challenging, play with just one simple instruction, and try again another time.  Play again and again as long as your child is enjoying the game. Make up different instructions with fun activities: “Can you run to Papa and then run back to Mama?” “Can you get the ball and roll the ball to Grandpapa?” </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child is learning to understand and follow simple two-part directions. As he or she gets older, he or she’ll be able to follow even more complex instructions, getting ready for school, and even more challenging learning activities. Your enjoyable games at home are stimulating your child’s cognitive development (reasoning) as well as her or his language and communication skills (understanding others’ instructions).</p>",12831,yes,parent,,6441,2926,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7826,Telling the Family What Happened at School,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is becoming able to tell about something that happened to her or him or that he or she remembers. It might be a video he or she watched, a book he or she has read many times, or — what happened in her or his school day! In many families, grandparents or aunts and uncles cannot be with your child but will love to talk on the phone (if not, you can change the activity!). If your child is eager to talk, call a special family member or friend and get started by saying something like “Kama wants to tell you about what happened at school today.  Kama, can you tell Grandma what happened first?”  (you might need to prompt, “Want to tell about the bus ride?”) Then encourage your child to continue as much as he or she wants, asking some questions or making suggestions about what to tell.</p>

<p>There are many ways to vary this. For example, your child might like to draw a picture about what happened and show or send it to family or a friend. Many other events can be made into stories for your child to tell. Remember that children differ in how comfortable they are in telling events to other people, so you might start with yourself. Another variation is to have your child tell her or his story into your phone’s recorder (if you have one). He or she will love hearing it played back.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Your child’s skills in communication, planning, and reasoning are all involved in her or his logical thinking about what to tell, and in what sequence. And of course, keeping connected with family strengthens your child’s social and emotional well-being. Keep up the conversations! </p>",12836,no,parent,,6441,7106,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7831,Listening to Birdsong,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Birdsong audio (optional)</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong></p>

<p>Step 1</p>

<p>Step outside and listen to the birds – the best time of day is around sunrise or sunset. See whether you can identify the sounds of more than one species.</p>

<p>Step 2</p>

<p>Imitate the sounds of the birds you can hear. Encourage younger children to practice these sounds, or see whether they can repeat them back to you.</p>

<p>Step 3</p>

<p>See whether you can identify which species of birds are making the sounds. Listen out for simple calls, like the ‘coo roo-c’too-coo’ or ‘oh-oo-oor’ of a pigeon. You may want to listen to examples of birdsong audio to help you identify different calls and songs.</p>

<p>Step 4</p>

<p>By recording or repeating the sounds heard, see if you can put together your own ‘dawn chorus’ of birdsong. It can be repetitive, like chanting the sounds, or without rhythm – that’s the beauty of birdsong!</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>Researchers have found parallels between the way young birds learn to sing and how babies learn to speak! Young birds master singing in stages. They start with a ‘subsong’ phase – the equivalent of babbling – then move on to fixing the melody, until they get it correct, similarly to the way human babies learn to speak.</p>",12841,no,parent,,6431,6991,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7836,Bouncing,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>None<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>It's time for a little bouncing. Keep your baby upright by holding her/his hands over a soft surface (preferably a mattress or other soft surface, or on your lap). Turn her/him so that you face each other and show her/him how much you enjoy this game. Follow her/his reactions. Your baby's legs at this age still can't bear her/his weight, so don't let her/him lean on them completely, you need to hold her/him well while he/she bends her/his legs bouncing. As long as he/she smiles, squeals or shows joy, repeat this ""bouncing"". As you bounce, talk or chant (""up we go, down we go"" for example; you can also sing a song or a nursery rhyme while doing this). </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning</strong>: This activity<strong> </strong>helps to develop your baby's later speech and language, and it is fun!</p>",3196,no,parent,,6441,2706,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7841,It Is Fun to Play Together,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Nothing special — anything you are using to play with your baby.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Play is something that you can do with your baby almost any time.  The activities in this resource have many great ideas for what to do.  Whatever your game is, encourage your child to be eager and excited to play. For example, you might pick up your baby and say in an excited way, “Look!  We are going to look at these things together!” while showing your baby what you will play. Or you might see that your baby’s face already shows eagerness and you could say “I see that you are awake from your nap. Are you ready to play? I am ready! Let’s go!”  You don’t need to make your child extremely excited, but create a warm, pleasant feeling for this time together.  And of course, if you see that your baby is becoming fussy or tired during the play, bring it to an end or introduce something a bit different.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>At this age and every age from now on, play becomes the most important way that your child will learn. However, learning will happen best if your child is eager to play. By making playtime enjoyable, you are doing one more thing to build the foundation for early learning, every day.<strong>  </strong></p>",12846,no,parent,,6436,2746,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7846,The Box,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Coloured papers or coloured origami paper; a box or container. If you don't have coloured paper, you can use your little one's toys.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>Before starting, prepare the place where you will play with your little one; you must make sure that the place is comfortable. You can sit your baby in front of you on a rug, in a chair or on a bed.</p>

<p>Place the coloured origami papers or simple coloured papers inside the box and play with them, showing your little one that there are papers of different shapes and colours, then invite her/him to take the papers out of the box and discover their textures and colours. Then teach your little one to keep them in the box. You can motivate her/him by singing a song.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>With this activity, you will encourage your little one to show curiosity about the things around her/him. Your child also develops fine and gross motor skills.</p>",12851,yes,parent,,6436,2841,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7851,Making a Picture Schedule,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>Paper and markers or pens and pencils; One or more picture books (If you do not have, you can make a simple one by pasting magazine pictures onto pages and putting together, or drawing simple pictures); Magazine pictures if you have some; Tape to hang up the schedule.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, children are aware that events often happen in a sequence (first, second, last) and at certain times.  As they begin school, schedules become important to them.  Many children enjoy and are helped by having a simple picture schedule.  With your child, you can make one that shows your typical routine at home.</p>

<p>Take a large piece of paper and some markers.  You can number the steps in the day’s routine. Then think with your child: “Every day, what is the first thing you do? Oh, Get Up!” and then help your child to draw something such as her or his bed.  You can print the words or help your child do some of that. If there are specific times and your child is interested, you can write those also. Go through the rest of the day, keeping it simple, but with meals, school, playing outdoors, etcetera.  Your child might say that weekends are different and might enjoy making a different schedule for those days.</p>

<p>When the schedule is finished, put it up where your child and you can look at it. </p>

<p><strong>What Your Child is Learning: </strong>You are building your child’s thinking abilities, as you organize the events of a typical day into an order or sequence (this also helps children’s math ability). Many children also feel more emotionally secure when they know exactly what to expect, especially if many things about life have been unpredictable at this time. </p>",12856,yes,parent,,6436,7116,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
7856,Pretending with My Doll,"<p><strong>Materials You Need: </strong>A doll or a stuffed animal or anything similar<strong>; </strong>A few other materials like a small cup and a blanket or cloth<strong>; </strong>Anything else that your child might use to pretend.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do Together: </strong>At this age, your child is beginning to “play pretend”— to use objects to create simple scenes that are familiar to your child. You can encourage this kind of play in simple ways. Sit with your child, take a favourite doll, soft bear or other similar toy (even made from socks and cloth) and pretend that the doll is a baby. You might rock the doll, sing a little song, “feed” with a cup, or tuck into a pretend bed — anything at all, but keep it simple. Put the doll down and see what your child does. He or she might do what you did or use the materials in a different way. You can describe what your child is doing — “Oh, is your baby sleepy? You are saying good-night!” Keep playing as long as your child is interested.  Leave the materials where your child can find and use them again on her own. Add new materials from time to time to keep an interest high.</p>

<p><strong>What Your Child Is Learning: </strong>This kind of play stimulates your child’s thinking skills as he or she uses one thing (such as a little toy bear) to “be” another (such as a real baby). This kind of thinking builds foundations for later academic competence. It also stimulates creativity and imagination and strengthens your bonds with your child as you spend time in enjoyable, playful activities.</p>",12861,yes,parent,,6436,2996,1,rs-en,review_after_translation
