21,How do vaccines work?,"<p>Vaccines contain either a very weakened form of the virus or bacterium that causes a disease, or a small part of it. When the body detects the contents of the vaccine, its immune system will produce the antibodies required to fight off infection and eliminate the disease-causing virus or bacterium. When a person later comes into contact with the virus or bacterium, the immune system will recognize it and protect the person by producing the right antibodies before any disease can be caused.</p>",58,,,"immunization, vaccination, child health, disease prevention",,en,published

111,Should infant formula replace breastfeeding if mother is COVID-19 positive,"<p>No, infant formula should not replace breastfeeding. There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings. The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised e.g. reduced access to health services if a baby becomes unwell / reduced access to clean water / access to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, not affordable and not sustainable.

116,Should infant formula be added to breastfeeding if mother is COVID-19 positive,"<p>No. If a mother is confirmed/suspected to have COVID-19 and is breastfeeding, there is no need to provide a ‘top-up’ with an infant formula milk. Giving a ‘top-up’ will reduce the amount of milk produced by a mother. Mothers who breastfeed should be supported to optimize positioning and attachment to ensure adequate milk production. Mothers should respond to infants’ hunger and breastfeed on demand.</p>",,,,"suspected COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, breastfeeding, infant formula",,en,draft
121,Are children receiving too many vaccines too soon?,"<p><strong>No. Newborns commonly manage many challenges to their immune systems at the same time. </strong>The mother’s womb is free from bacteria and viruses, so newborns immediately face a host of different challenges to their immune systems. From the moment of birth, thousands of different bacteria start to live on the surface of the intestines. By quickly making immune responses to these bacteria, babies keep them from invading the bloodstream and causing serious diseases. In fact, babies are capable of responding to millions of different viruses and bacteria because they have billions of immunological cells circulating in their bodies. Therefore, vaccines given in the first two years of life are a drop in the ocean of what an infant’s immune system successfully encounters and manages every day.</p>",46,,,"vaccines, safety, newborns, delaying vaccines",,en,draft
126,Can I put a sunscreen cream on my baby?,"<p>We never put a cream with a protective factor on babies up to 6 months of age. We protect it in other ways, a hat with a large brim on the head, glasses that protect from UV radiation on the eyes, a parasol on the stroller so that the baby is in the shade all the time, and a greasy cream is applied to the hands and cheeks.</p>

<p>Infants older than 6 months should be protected with the cream with the highest protection factor. Apply the cream 20 minutes before going for a walk and apply again every two hours. Avoid sun exposure between 11 am and 5 pm. When using a new cream, you must first test it, apply a small area of ​​the child's skin in the area of ​​the forearm and make sure that there is no rash, redness or itching in the next 24 hours. If there are no changes in the skin, the child can apply this protective cream. Remember that sunscreen filters UV radiation, but doesn’t completely block it out.

131,Can I spoil my baby?,"<p>The answer to this question is ‘<strong>No!</strong>’</p>

<p>Babies do need lots of attention, and you might worry – or other people might tell you – that if you ‘give in’ too often or give too much attention, it will ‘spoil’ your baby. But this won’t happen. <strong>You won’t create bad habits by responding</strong> to your baby’s needs.</p>

<p>Very young babies can’t consciously connect cause and effect. They don’t think to themselves, ‘I’m going to cry until I get what I want!’ If your baby is crying or fussing, it might be because she’s cold or hungry, has a dirty nappy, or is in pain. Or she might just want to know you’re nearby. Ignoring your baby when she’s fussing won’t teach her to sort it out for herself, because she can’t do that yet.</p>",,,,"care, bonding, stimulation, crying",,en,published

156,How often should I breastfeed my newborn?,"<p>During the first week of life of your baby, breastfeed will be when he/she is hungry. Usually, it is every 1,5 hours to 3 hours. While days pass, newborns will breastfeed less often and will start to develop a more predictable schedule. Some babies can feed very often, while others can do it less. Normally, during the first month of life, babies should breastfeed 8 to 12 times per day. Frequent feedings help stimulate mothers production of milk during the firsts weeks. After the first month your baby will breastfeed less often, normally will be 7 to 9 times per day.</p>",,,,"newborn, breastfeeding, breastfeeding frequency, newborns",,en,published
161,What is corrected age?,"<p>Corrected age, or adjusted age, is your premature baby’s <strong>chronological age minus the number of weeks or months he was born early</strong>. For example, a one-year-old who was born three months early would have a corrected age of nine months.</p>

<p>Corrected age can be helpful if you’re trying to work out whether your premature baby’s development is tracking in a typical way. For example, if someone notices that your child is six months old but not sitting up yet, you could explain that she was born three months early. If you look at her corrected age, she’s really only three months old and she’s doing everything a three-month-old usually does.</p>

<p>Corrected age is especially relevant during your child’s early years, because it might explain things that look like lags in development in these years.</p>",46,,,"corrected age, adjusted age, premature baby, newborn",,en,published

5556,Is it safe to vaccinate children during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"<p>WHO recommends that all routine vaccinations be administered as scheduled, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is currently no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic poses any specific risk linked to vaccination. Evidence for other infectious diseases is therefore applied. This evidence suggests that potential contact with an infectious disease is not a contraindication for routine immunization. Routine immunization sessions should continue to the extent possible and as permitted within the local COVID-19 response context. However, standard infection prevention measures should be in place to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission to all staff and visitors to the health facility.</p>

<p>It is especially important that children receive all the vaccines scheduled at birth and in the first two years of life. These vaccines may vary according to national recommendations. Any interrupted immunization services for any age groups should be resumed and catch-up vaccinations offered as quickly as possible. Timely vaccination is key to protect young and old from serious and life-threatening infectious diseases, and to avoid the accumulation of unvaccinated groups and potential loss of community immunity.</p>",,,,"vaccination, COVID-19, immunisation, vaccines, delaying vaccines",,en,published
5561,Does vaccination increase a child’s risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 or of developing the disease?,"<p>COVID-19 is a new disease for which information is still being gathered. However, based on experience with other infectious diseases, vaccination against one disease does not weaken a person’s immune response to another disease. There is currently no evidence that vaccination would increase the risk of a child becoming infected with COVID-19 or affect the course of the disease in a child who has been inadvertently vaccinated during the asymptomatic phase or incubation period.</p>

<p>Furthermore, continuing routine vaccination of children during the COVID-19 pandemic will protect them from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD). Ensuring that the immunization sessions are conducted in a facility with adequate infection prevention measures will minimize any potential risk of children getting COVID-19.</p>",,,,"vaccination, delaying vaccines, immunization, COVID-19",,en,published
5566,Why is vaccination particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"<p>Any disruption of immunization services, even for short periods, would leave a community and especially children at immediate risk of VPDs.  By adding to the number of susceptible individuals already present in a community, this would put community protection at risk and increase the likelihood of VPD outbreaks. Such outbreaks may result in VPD-related illnesses and deaths and an increased burden on health-care systems already strained by the response to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>",,,,"vaccines, vaccination, delaying vaccines, immunization, immunisation",,en,published
5571,Is it dangerous to vaccinate a child during the incubation period of COVID-19?,"<p>There is currently no specific evidence regarding COVID-19 and vaccination, and general principles of vaccination of patients with infectious diseases should be applied. According to these principles, vaccination will not influence the course of infectious disease in a child who might already be infected but who is not yet symptomatic at the time of vaccination, or a child who becomes infected soon after vaccination. Neither will the child’s potential infection influence the safety or efficacy of the vaccine that is administered.</p>",,,,"vaccination, vaccines, delaying vaccines, immunisation, immunization, suspected COVID-19",,en,published
5576,Is COVID-19 a contraindication for vaccination?,"<p>Mild symptoms such as fever and/or cough are not necessarily a contraindication for vaccination. In line with normal procedures, the health-care provider should make recommendations based on a risk–benefit assessment (severity of symptoms and risk and severity of VPDs). If the practitioner decides against vaccination on that day, the normal vaccination schedule for the child should be resumed as soon as possible after he or she recovers.</p>

<p>It is important that anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 remains isolated in line with national recommendations to ensure that they do not infect others and contribute to further spread of the virus.</p>",,,,"delaying vaccines, vaccination, vaccines, immunization, immunisation, suspected COVID-19",,en,published

Two clinical trials are underway to look at whether the BCG vaccine could have a role in protecting health-care workers and other vulnerable individuals against severe COVID-19, but so far there is no evidence that the BCG vaccine protects people against infection with the novel coronavirus. WHO therefore does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19.
