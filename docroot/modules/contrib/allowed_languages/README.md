INTRODUCTION
------------

The Allowed Languages module makes it possible to set restrictions on which
content a user can edit based on language.

A typical use case would be a multilingual site where one editor writes in
English, another in German, and a third in French. A user can be allowed
one or multiple languages.

   further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

    1. Navigate to Administration > Extend and enable the module.
    2. To access and administer this new field provided by the module, a user
       (i.e. administrator), needs to have the "allowed languages permission"
       from the Drupal permissions settings page.
    3. Once the module has been enabled there will be an allowed languages field
       on each user profile. The administrator is then able to assign the
       language(s) the user can create/edit.
