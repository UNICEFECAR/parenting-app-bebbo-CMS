6,Playing with newborns,"Play is important for overall newborn development, learning, wellbeing and bonding.
Playing with your newborn is about interacting with your baby.
Newborn play ideas include smiling at your baby, blowing raspberries and having tummy time.","<h1>Playing with newborns: why it’s important</h1>

<h2><strong>Play is essential for your baby’s overall development</strong>, learning and wellbeing.</h2>

<p>Through play, your newborn learns about the world around him and how he can interact with it. New play experiences also help parts of your newborn’s brain connect and grow. And play that gets your newborn moving builds muscle strength as well as gross motor skills and fine motor skills.</p>

<p>Playing with your newborn helps her learn to <strong>talk and understand words</strong>. You might not always have time to stop everything and play, but you can still chat to your newborn about what’s going on – for example, while cooking dinner, shopping or folding clothes.</p>

<p>Playing together helps you and your newborn get to <strong>know each other</strong>. That’s because play can tell you a lot about your newborn’s personality. Rough and silly or quiet and calm, you’ll soon know what your newborn likes.</p>

<h2>Play ideas for newborn babies</h2>

<p>Playing with your newborn is about the <strong>interactions between you and your newborn</strong>, not about games and toys. This means that all you need to get started with newborn play is yourself and your baby.</p>

<p>Here are some play ideas for newborn babies:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Sing, chat, tickle, count toes, blow raspberries – simple things are best for newborns. Babies also love nursery rhymes that involve touch like ‘Round and round the garden’. Sharing nursery rhymes or traditional songs from your own culture and language is great too.</li>
	<li>Make faces, smile, laugh, roll your eyes or poke out your tongue. Your newborn loves watching your face. Nappy-changing is a great time for <strong>face-to-face play</strong>.</li>
	<li>Give your newborn different objects to feel – soft toys, rattles or cloth books with pages of different textures are lots of fun for your newborn. Feeling different things helps your newborn learn about the world.</li>
	<li>Give your newborn different things to look at – outside, inside, different people or different rooms.</li>
	<li>Give your newborn tummy time each day. This gives your newborn practice holding up his head and lets him see things from a different point of view. Always watch your newborn during tummy time and put him on his back to sleep.</li>
	<li>Talk or make sounds with your newborn, and wait for her to respond. It might take a little while but you’ll be surprised at how much your newborn has to ‘say’. This shows your newborn that conversations are about taking turns, listening and responding.</li>
	<li>Try reading with your baby. It’s never too early to start, but remember to hold the book close – newborns can see only about 20-30 cm in front of them.</li>
</ul>

<table>

		<tr>
			<td>And remember to <strong>enjoy yourselves</strong>. It’s only play if it’s fun.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Follow your baby’s cues. Even babies with lots of energy need downtime and might feel overwhelmed if you keep trying to play with them when they’re tired. If your newborn baby seems startled or upset, try playing a quieter game a bit later.</p>",4861,55,"43,44,45",59,60,"71, 76, 81, 86, 91",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/play-ideas/playing-with-newborns"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/play-ideas/playing-with-newborns</a></p>",en,published
11,Newborn sleep routines,Flexibility is the key when it comes to baby and newborn sleep routines.,"<h1>Newborn sleep: some basics</h1>

<p>Newborns spend most of their time asleep. They’re programmed to sleep in short bursts of about 2-3 hours between feeds, night and day.</p>

<p>Your baby will need your attention during the night for feeding and settling for up to the first six months. Some babies keep waking even after this.</p>

<p><strong>Newborn sleep routines can be as varied as they are for babies and parents. </strong>The approach you take will depend on the choices you make about things like where your baby sleeps – for example, in her own bed or in a side-car crib next to your bed.</p>

<p>Some parents opt for little or no routine at all, and are comfortable with following their baby’s lead. Others find that a very simple, flexible routine seems to help their baby, and helps them to feel more in control.</p>

<p>This isn’t the time for rigid plans. You might find your baby won’t fit into even the best-laid plans anyway! In the first few months of your baby’s life, <strong>it’s best to go slowly</strong> – get to know each other, and work out what’s best for baby and for you.</p>

<h2>Feed, play and sleep: a simple newborn sleep routine</h2>

<p>With a newborn, <strong>it helps to be flexible about when your baby sleeps and feeds</strong>. But many infant health experts believe that, when it feels right for you, it can also help to begin doing things in a similar order each day – feed, play, sleep.</p>

<p>When your baby wakes up, you could try this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Offer a feed.</li>
	<li>Change your baby’s nappy.</li>
	<li>Take time for talk and play.</li>
	<li>Put your baby back down for sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>At night, you might choose not to play and instead focus on settling your baby straight back to sleep.</p>

<p>For young babies, playtime might just be a quiet cuddle or some time stretching out and kicking on a blanket. You might find about 10-20 minutes of play is enough. Some newborn babies get tired after being awake for about 1-1½ hours. Some newborns are happy to play for longer than this.</p>

<p>You can watch your baby’s tired signs and body language to see when it’s time to stop.</p>

<p>The key is to follow your baby’s lead about when to feed, play and sleep, but to start doing these things in a similar order through the day.</p>

<h2>Daytime sleep for newborns</h2>

<p>Keeping your baby awake all day won’t help your baby sleep better at night. Daytime sleep is important too. But it’s best not to let your baby sleep longer than four hours in one stretch during the day. After that, babies need to feed.</p>

<h2>Feeding and sleep for newborns</h2>

<p>Generally, newborns need to be fed every 2-4 hours. Your baby will sleep better after a good feed.</p>

<h2>Settling and newborns</h2>

<p>Newborns need your help when they’re unsettled. If they’ve been fed in the last two hours, cuddling and comfort are in order. You could also try topping up your baby with a feed to help send your baby to sleep.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Wrapping your newborn in lightweight cotton or muslin can help with settling. Wrapping or swaddling can reduce crying and waking because it helps keep babies stable on their backs and stops their arms flapping. However, make sure that the baby is always on his or her back when swaddled. The swaddle should not be too tight or make it hard for the baby to breathe or move his or her hips. When your baby looks like he or she is trying to roll over, you should stop swaddling.</td>

16,Safe sleeping: 11 tips,It’s natural to find yourself checking your sleeping newborn to make sure everything is OK. You can also take simple and effective safe sleeping steps to minimize the risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and fatal sleeping accidents.,"<h1>SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents: risk factors</h1>

<p>When a baby dies unexpectedly and for no obvious reason, it’s often described as sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). SUDI is a broad term that includes SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents.</p>

<p>Deaths from SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents have decreased a lot in Australia. This is because we understand more about safe sleeping practices for our babies, and we’ve been following these practices. These <strong>safe sleeping practices can reduce the risk of SUDI </strong>including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents.</p>

<h2>Safe sleeping steps to reduce the risk of SUDI</h2>

<p><strong>1. Put babies to sleep on their backs</strong><br />
This is the safest position for healthy babies. Babies are more likely to die of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents if they sleep on their sides or tummies.</p>

<p>Once your baby can roll over (at around 4-6 months), keep putting him to sleep on his back, but let him find his own sleeping position.</p>

<p><strong>2. Make sure babies’ heads or faces can’t get covered while they’re sleeping</strong><br />
Put your baby low down in the cot, so her feet are near the bottom end. Tuck in the bed sheets securely so they can’t cover your baby’s head. You could use a safe infant sleeping bag instead of blankets. Sleeping bags with a fitted neck and armholes and no hood are the safest.</p>

<p><strong>3. Avoid smoking</strong><br />
There’s strong evidence that exposure to second-hand smoke harms babies, and that smoking during pregnancy and after birth increases the risk of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents. The link between SUDI and smoking is strong even when parents smoke away from their babies.</p>

<p><strong>4. Use a cot that meets safety standards</strong><br />
Only well-maintained cots built to strict safety standards are good enough for your baby. Cots that don’t meet the standards have many risks, including lead paint, gaps that a young child can get caught in, and sides that are too low and that your child could climb over.</p>

<p><strong>5. Share a room</strong><br />
Have your baby in a cot in your room for the first 6-12 months.</p>

<p><strong>6. Breastfeed your baby if you can</strong><br />
Breastfeeding reduces by more than half the risk of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents. And regardless of whether your baby is breastfed or bottle-fed, it’s still very important to follow safe sleeping practices.</p>

<p><strong>7. Avoid cot bumpers, soft toys and pillows</strong><br />
Babies have been suffocated by rolling into or being covered by these soft objects. It’s safest to keep them out of your baby’s cot.</p>

<p><strong>8. Use a firm and well-fitting mattress</strong><br />
Make sure there are no gaps between the mattress and the edge of the cot, where a baby’s head could get jammed.  If you’re using a portable cot, use only the firm, thin, well-fitting mattress that comes with it. Don’t add a second mattress.</p>

<p><strong>9. Avoid baby sleeping on couches or makeshift bedding</strong><br />
Sleeping on a couch, with or without someone else, is very dangerous for babies. Also take care with makeshift bedding. Some situations where your baby might be in danger include getting wedged between a mattress and a wall, getting stuck between pillows or cushions, or slipping down until his head is covered by blankets.</p>

<p><strong>10. Dress your baby in clothing that’s warm, but not hot</strong><br />
Overheating is a risk factor for SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents. Ask yourself what you would wear to bed and use that as a guide. Keep your baby’s head uncovered indoors – this allows your baby to cool and not overheat. Don’t worry if your baby’s hands and feet feel cool – that’s normal.</p>

<p><strong>11. Make sure your baby’s carers know how to protect against SUDI</strong><br />
It’s best not to assume that other people know about safe sleeping practices, even professional child carers. Have a look at the planned sleeping arrangements, and make sure yourself that your baby will be positioned safely for sleep. For example, it isn’t recommended to leave a baby sleeping in a pram unsupervised.</p>",1216,3,"43,44,45,46",59,60,"111, 116",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/sleep/sleep-safety/safe-sleeping-tips"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/sleep/sleep-safety/safe-sleeping-tips</a>+</p>",en,published

	<li>Do not give anything else, not even water, during your baby’s first 6 months.</li>
	<li>Giving your baby anything else (any foods, cow’s milk, juice, tea or even water)  will cause him/her to suckle less and will reduce the amount of breast milk that you produce.  This  may make your baby sick and prevent your baby from growing well.</li>
	<li>You can give medicines to the baby if they are recommended by your health provider.</li>

31,Singing in a second language: activity for children 0-6 years,"Singing is a fun way to help your child learn a second language and be bilingual.
For younger children, choose simple and familiar songs to start with.
For older children, you can look for pop songs in the second language.","<h2>Singing in a second language: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Being bilingual--understanding and speaking two languages--benefits children's development. Singing is <strong>a fun way to help your child learn and remember words and sentence structure</strong> in a second language.</p>

<p>When your child sings songs with repeated words or choruses, he gets lots of practice with new words and sentence structures. This helps your child remember these new words.</p>

<p>Songs with a cultural or personal significance – for example, songs passed down in your family – can have extra meaning for your child.</p>

<h2>What you need to sing with your child in a second language</h2>

<p>Choose a simple song in your second language to sing with your child.</p>

<p>If you don’t know any good songs, you could look for CDs and DVDs at your public library, or search online.</p>

<h2>How to sing with your child in a second language</h2>

<p>Here are some <strong>ideas to get you singing</strong> with your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose songs with hand movements, or make up some movements. Hand movements help your child remember what the song means, even if she doesn’t understand all the words.</li>
	<li>Sing the song to your child. Don’t worry about what you sound like. Your child will love the sound of your voice, even if you’re off-key.</li>
	<li>Choose songs your child already knows in his first language, like ‘Happy birthday’.</li>
	<li>Put lots of expression into your voice and face as you sing.</li>
	<li>Praise your child when she sings the words or copies the actions with you. Your child might remember only one or two words to begin with.</li>
	<li>Explain what the song is about. You don’t have to translate every word.</li>
	<li>Try to use some of the words and phrases from songs in everyday conversation with your child. It can be fun to sing parts of the song if you can fit them into what you’re saying.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Singing in a second language: adapting for children of different ages</h2>

<p>You can sing songs in different languages to <strong>your baby</strong> as soon as he’s born or even before. You don’t have to wait until he starts to talk or until he’s fluent in one language. Children can learn two or more languages at the same time.</p>

<p>A catchy pop song can be a good way for <strong>your older child</strong> to learn a language. Your child might recognise only one or two words or phrases, but if she likes it enough she’ll keep listening until she understands more. You might want to check the lyrics to make sure the content is suitable.</p>",51,55,"44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"156, 161, 166",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/singing-in-a-second-language-activity-for-children-0-6-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/singing-in-a-second-language-activity-for-children-0-6-years</a></p>",en,published
36,Physical activity for young children,"Physical activity can start very early in life as part of everyday play.
When you’re choosing activities for young children, focus on fun and play.
At least 30 minutes of tummy time each day helps babies grow and develop.
Children aged 1-5 years need physical activity for at least three hours each day, including some energetic play.","<h2>Daily physical activity: focusing on fun</h2>

<p>When you’re choosing physical activity for babies, toddlers and preschoolers, <strong>focus on activities that are fun</strong>.</p>

<p>If children enjoy what they’re doing, they’re more likely to want to keep doing it. And physical activities that children enjoy will increase their confidence and ability to move well.</p>

<p>Physical activity is vital to your child’s healthy growth and development. And it can start very early in life as part of your child’s everyday play.</p>

<h2>Physical activity for children 0-2 years</h2>

<p><strong>Before baby can walk</strong></p>

<p>Even tiny babies like to stretch and play. A large blanket on the floor (or on the grass outside) for tummy time can be a safe, clean and welcoming place for babies to practise lifting their heads. This helps them develop strong muscles.</p>

<p>A blanket on the ground or floor is also a great place for baby to learn to roll, creep, crawl and sit. Put a toy or object just out of reach for the fun of trying to get it.</p>

<p>Things to grab and hold, like old boxes, make tummy time fun. Bright colours, drawings of dots, squares or stars, shiny surfaces, changing textures and different sounds can also interest your child.</p>

<p>You can also encourage your baby to look, clap, reach or move to sound – try talking, singing, rhyming or action games like pat-a-cake and peekaboo.</p>

<p>If you’re putting your baby on the floor, just remember to look for potential hazards down at baby’s level. Stay with your baby to keep things safe.</p>

<h3><strong>When baby starts to walk</strong></h3>

<p>Once your child is walking, you can encourage her just by letting her move often.</p>

<p>This is a great time to look for objects and activities that encourage movement – for example, climbing steps at home (with supervision!).</p>

<h2>Physical activity for children 2-5 years</h2>

<p>Toddlers and preschoolers need plenty of free time and space to just run around and play, at home, in your neighborhood, anywhere safe, supervised and fun.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for <strong>keeping physical activity fun</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Use large, soft balls to practise catching, hitting, bouncing and kicking. When spaces aren’t safe for balls, some rolled-up socks can be good for this activity.</li>
	<li>Make up games that involve different types of movement--chasing, walking a chalk line, jumping over puddles.</li>
	<li>Play different kinds of music, or make sounds with your voice or instruments.</li>
	<li>You could play guess the animal games, where you run like a monkey, jump like a bunny, flap like a bird and so on.</li>
	<li>When your child is ready, let her try learning to ride a bike, scooter or tricycle – under your supervision, of course. She might also enjoy playing with push toys like trucks, doll prams and toy lawn mowers.</li>

41,Thinking and play: babies,"Right from the start of her life, your baby’s brain is hard at work as she makes sense of the world and herself. Even when it looks like simple play, your baby is learning all the time. Here are simple and fun play ideas to support your baby’s cognitive development.","<h2>About baby play and cognitive development</h2>

<p>Babies are active and curious learners, busy watching, thinking and trying to work things out. They learn and grow through <strong>new experiences</strong>, especially new play experiences.</p>

<p>Through play, babies develop the skills to think, understand, communicate, remember, imagine and work out what might happen next. These skills are all part of your baby’s cognitive development.</p>

<p>For babies, play is mostly about <strong>back-and-forth interactions </strong>with you. When you interact with your baby during play, you give your baby important information that he uses to understand the world. For example, a simple game of peekaboo helps your baby learn that when dad disappears, he comes back too.</p>

<h2>What to expect: baby cognitive development</h2>

<p>Your baby is likely to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>look at things when you name them, from about eight months</li>
	<li>talk to you in ‘coos’ and expect you to respond</li>
	<li>be fascinated by older children</li>
	<li>enjoy repetitive games and hearing the same story over and over</li>
	<li>recognise people that she sees at least once a week</li>
	<li>respond to your facial expressions – for example, if your baby sees a new toy and you smile, this tells her that the toy is safe and fun</li>
	<li>explore new objects by putting them in her mouth.</li>
</ul>

<p>From <strong>8-12 months</strong>, your baby might look like he’s experimenting during play. For example, he might throw a bowl towards the floor and watch it fall, push over the rubbish bin, or throw toys at the wall to figure out how things work. He’ll test all toys and any objects within reach – cups, saucers and even pets.</p>

<p>This isn’t being naughty. It’s your baby learning about cause and effect – that is, ‘If I do this, that will happen’. It’s not surprising that your baby enjoys cause-and-effect toys – playing with them means she can push a button and something happens.</p>

<p>If your baby has lots of opportunities to <strong>test out the environment</strong>, he has the chance to learn more and more every day. If you set up a safe environment and always supervise your baby, he can roam and learn with freedom.</p>

<h2>Play ideas for encouraging baby cognitive development</h2>

<h3><strong>At 3-6 months</strong></h3>

<p>Here are some fun and simple play ideas for you and your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read books, sing songs, and recite nursery rhymes together. Babies enjoy cloth books with different textures, flaps and puppets.</li>
	<li>Teach your baby how to hold, drop and roll different balls. This helps your baby learn about how things move.</li>
	<li>Play with rattles, bells and other toys that make noise.</li>
	<li>Put toys around your baby to encourage her to move.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>At 6-12 months</strong></h3>

<p>From this age, you and your baby can explore more ways to play:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide lots of <strong>fun bath toys </strong>for dunking, measuring, floating and pouring. Plastic milk bottles and food containers work just as well as shop-bought toys.</li>
	<li>Give your baby toys that let him push a button to make something happen, or try activities like shaking or banging objects.</li>
	<li>Play with stacking blocks and toys that your baby can roll or push across the floor.</li>
	<li>When reading with your baby, use different voices for different characters or make the sounds of different animals.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can give your baby a few play options to choose from, but <strong>don’t overwhelm her </strong>with too many. Let her take her time choosing what she wants to do.</p>

<p>It’s also good to <strong>step back</strong> and give your child the chance to work things out on his own sometimes. You can still help your baby’s learning by describing what he’s doing. For example, ‘That pot makes a big noise when you bang it!’</p>

<p>It’s also good to respond to <strong>your baby’s interests</strong> and share her delight when she discovers new things, however small they might seem. For example, ‘Wow! Look how the little red boat floats in your bath’.</p>

46,Talking and play: toddlers,"As a toddler, your child is starting to master language. You can encourage toddler talking skills with everyday play ideas – listening to your child, chatting together, singing and telling stories.","<h2>About toddler talking</h2>

<p>Your toddler’s language will start to ‘explode’ soon, although your child has been learning about words, sounds and back-and-forth conversations since birth.</p>

<p>You can keep encouraging toddler talking by singing, saying nursery rhymes, talking, reading and telling stories.</p>

<h2>What to expect: toddler talking</h2>

<p>Your toddler will probably start to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>speak in correct sentences from 24-30 months</li>
	<li>be understood more by strangers from 26-36 months</li>
	<li>use pronouns (I, you, me, we, they) and some plurals from 26-36 months</li>
	<li>understand most of what adults say by about three years.</li>
</ul>

<p>By <strong>birthday number two</strong>, your toddler will probably enjoy naming everyday things, like ‘doggie’ and ‘drink’. She’ll also be able to understand and follow a simple request, like ‘Bring me your book’ or ‘Wave bye-bye’.</p>

<p>By the <strong>age of three</strong>, your child will probably move on to simple sentences, like ‘Where doggie gone?’ By now strangers will probably be able to understand most of what your child says, even though he’ll still struggle to express some words clearly.</p>

<p>Talking can be frustrating for toddlers – they can have so much to tell you but <strong>can’t quite get the words out</strong>. If you give your toddler time, she’ll get there eventually. Trying and making mistakes are important parts of learning.</p>

<p>Toddlers respond best to encouragement and interest, rather than correction or being made fun of, so try to <strong>avoid correcting your toddler’s mistakes</strong> too often.</p>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage toddler talking</h2>

<p>The more words you expose your child to, the more words she’ll learn. Here are some play ideas to encourage toddler talking:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read with your child.</li>
	<li>Talk about the ordinary things you do each day – for example, ‘I’m hanging these clothes to dry outside because it’s a nice day’.</li>
	<li>Respond to and talk about your child’s interests. For example, if your child is pretending to drive a car, ask him where he’s going.</li>
	<li>Recite nursery rhymes and sing songs. Play rhymes, stories and songs in the car.</li>
	<li>Copy your child’s attempts at words to encourage two-way conversation. Also build on basic words – for example, when your toddler says ‘train’, you can say, ‘Yes, it’s a big red train’.</li>
	<li>When your child is ‘talking’, show that you’re listening by smiling and looking at her. Also praise your child’s efforts to talk.</li>
	<li>Leave time after you talk to give your child a chance to reply. He might not always have the right words, but he’ll still try to respond. This helps children learn about conversation.</li>
	<li>Point to and name body parts, or make it into a game – for example, ‘Where is your mouth?’</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Screen time and toddler talking</strong></h3>

<p>Screen time isn’t recommended for children under 18 months, other than video-chatting. After 18 months, your child can have some screen time, but it’s best to watch or play with your child.</p>

<p>Long periods of screen time have been associated with a range of health issues in toddlers and preschoolers, as well as the <strong>slower development of language skills</strong>, short-term memory and poorer social skills.</p>

<p>If at 18 months your toddler isn’t babbling often, isn’t using meaningful words or doesn’t seem to hear you or listen when others are talking, it’s a good idea to see a GP, paediatrician or child and family health nurse. You might also want to see a child health professional or talk to your child’s carer or early childhood educator if you can’t understand your child’s speech by the time she’s three, or if she still isn’t speaking much by this age.</p>",71,55,"50,51",59,60,"191, 196, 201, 206",,1,0,,en,published
51,Teaching your child how to get dressed,"Getting dressed is an important skill for children to learn – but it can be hard.
It helps to break getting dressed into small steps. Teaching the last step first can work well.
Keep in mind that every child is different and will develop skills at different rates.","<h2>Why your child needs to learn how to get dressed</h2>

<p>Learning to get dressed builds your child’s confidence and independence and gives your child a sense of achievement. And once your child can dress himself, helping him get dressed is one less thing for you to do.</p>

<p>Also, getting dressed <strong>helps your child develop many other skills</strong>, including:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>fine motor skills as she learns to fasten buttons and zips</li>
	<li>gross motor skills as she stands on one leg to pull on a pair of pants</li>
	<li>cognitive skills as she remembers which bits of clothing go on first, and builds the patience and attention to finish the task</li>
	<li>language as she names types of clothes, colours and sizes</li>
	<li>awareness of time and space as she learns to dress for certain occasions and weather conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting started with getting dressed</h2>

<p>Often very young children start to be aware of clothing by pulling off easy-to-remove things like socks, shoes or hats. Sometimes they try to put them on again. You can build on this early awareness by <strong>naming the clothes</strong> your child has taken off and the body parts they go on.</p>

<p>You can start to include your older baby or toddler in getting dressed by <strong>giving him a limited choice of clothes</strong>, and naming them as you put them on him.</p>

<p>When you decide it’s time for your child to really start learning this skill, it can help to <strong>have some easy clothes on hand</strong>. These might include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>loose, elastic-waisted pants</li>
	<li>clothes with velcro or large buttons and button holes</li>
	<li>jumpers, t-shirts and underwear with pictures on the front to help your child work out front from back</li>
	<li>clothes that are easy and comfortable for your child to move in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting dressed: breaking down the steps</h2>

<p>Getting dressed can have a lot of steps. It helps to break it down into smaller steps – for example, putting on underwear, then t-shirt, shorts, socks and shoes.</p>

<p>You can also break down each of the steps in getting dressed, depending on your child’s skill and age. For example, you could break down the steps for putting on shorts like this:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Face shorts the right way.</li>
	<li>Hold onto the front of the waistband.</li>
	<li>Push one leg at a time through the leg holes while also holding pants.</li>
	<li>Pull the shorts up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Talking your child through each step helps her know what to do. In the early stages, simple words or phrases are OK – for example, ‘Shirt on’. You can say more as your child’s language develops – for example, ‘Push your arm through the sleeve’.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>When your child can almost dress himself (usually from three years and up), you can check whether he understands the steps by asking, ‘What’s the first thing you need to put on?’ If he can’t remember, you can help him get started by reminding him.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Getting dressed: teaching the steps backwards</h2>

<p>A good way to teach your child how to get dressed is to break down each task into small steps and teach her the last step first. Once your child can do the last step of the task, teach her the second-last step, then the third-last step and so on.</p>

<p>For example, when putting on shorts, you might help your child face the shorts the right way, hold the waistband and put his legs through the leg holes. <strong>Then teach your child the last step</strong> – pulling up the shorts to his waist by himself.</p>

<p>Once your child can do this, teach her to put her legs through the leg holes and pull her shorts up. <strong>You can keep working your way backwards through the steps</strong> until your child has mastered them all and can put her shorts on for herself.</p>

<p>A big advantage of this approach is that often the most rewarding thing about a task is getting it finished – and your child gets to this reward sooner when he can do the last step first.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>If your child is having trouble, it can be tempting to jump in to help. But give your child a chance to work it out for herself, and cheer her on as she tries – she’ll get a real confidence boost when she does it on her own. Step in only when your child really needs your help.</td>

<h2>Tips for helping your child learn to get dressed</h2>

<p>If you can be positive and supportive, your child is more likely to cooperate. So a lot of praise will go a long way, even if your child has put his pants on backwards! Here are some practical tips to help.</p>

<h3><strong>Making time</strong></h3>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Allow a realistic amount of time for getting dressed.</li>
	<li>If you’re often rushed in the morning, try choosing clothes with your child the night before.</li>
	<li>When you’re in a hurry, let your child do the easy tasks and help her with the difficult tasks.</li>
	<li>Practise getting dressed when you and your child aren’t in a hurry or tired.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Choosing appropriate clothes</strong></h3>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Let your younger child choose from a couple of options, like two t-shirts. Older or more mature children might be able to choose their own clothing.</li>
	<li>Talk about the weather when you and your child are choosing clothes. Ask your child whether it’s hot or cold, raining or sunny.</li>
	<li>Teach your child the difference between dirty and clean clothes – for example, ‘Dirty clothes go in the laundry basket. You can wear them again when they’re back in the drawer’. You can use some simple guidelines, like wearing clean underwear and socks every day.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Making it easier</strong></h3>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Have your child sit down for dressing tasks. Sitting on the floor might be easier than sitting on a chair or bed for some children.</li>
	<li>Store clothing in drawers and cupboards that your child can get to easily. Label clothing drawers with a picture or word to describe the clothing that’s in the drawer.</li>
	<li>Wear clothes that have clear front and back clues – for example, a picture on the front and a tag on the back.</li>
	<li>Teach undressing first – it’s easier than dressing. Being able to undress by himself will boost your child’s confidence.</li>

<h2>Teaching children with disability or developmental delay to get dressed</h2>

<p>Some children with disability or developmental delays can have trouble getting dressed. Some children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have sensory sensitivities that make it hard for them to cope with the texture of different materials on their skin.</p>

<p>If you’re having trouble teaching your child with disability or development delay to get dressed, an occupational therapist who works specifically with children might be able to help. OTs can give you strategies to teach your child to dress, or suggest equipment that can make the process easier.</p>

<h2>Development of skills for getting dressed</h2>

<p>Here’s a rough guide to dressing skills at different ages. Keep in mind that every child is different and will develop skills at different rates.</p>

<p>At <strong>one year</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>hold their arms out for sleeves and put their feet up for shoes</li>
	<li>push their arms through sleeves and legs through pants</li>
	<li>pull socks and shoes off.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>two years</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>take off unfastened coats</li>
	<li>take off shoes when the laces are untied</li>
	<li>help push down pants</li>
	<li>find armholes in t-shirts.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>2½ years</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>pull down pants with elastic waists</li>
	<li>try to put on socks</li>
	<li>put on front-buttoned shirts, without doing up buttons</li>
	<li>unbutton large buttons.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>three years</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>put on t-shirts with little help</li>
	<li>put on shoes without fastening – they might put them on the wrong feet</li>
	<li>put on socks – they might have trouble getting their heels in the right place</li>
	<li>pull down pants by themselves</li>
	<li>zip and unzip without joining or separating zippers</li>
	<li>take off t-shirts without help</li>
	<li>button large front buttons.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>four years</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>take off t-shirts by themselves</li>
	<li>buckle shoes or belts</li>
	<li>connect jacket zippers and zip them up</li>
	<li>put on socks the right way</li>
	<li>put on shoes with little help</li>
	<li>know the front and back of clothing.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>4½ years</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>step into pants and pull them up</li>
	<li>thread belts through buckles.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>five years</strong> children can usually:</p>

<ul>
	<li>dress without your help or supervision</li>
	<li>put on t-shirts or jumpers the right way each time.</li>

56,Winter activities to keep children active,"Your child can still be physically active even if it’s cold or wet outside. You can go to the beach in wild weather, jump in puddles or fly a kite. If you’re staying indoors, you can make up physically active games, dances and activities. Other options include indoor play centres and winter sports.","<h2>Free outdoor winter activities</h2>

<p>Even when it’s cold and wet outside, you and your child can still be active around your home and neighbourhood. There are plenty of free or low-cost things you can do:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Put on coats, hats and gloves and head outside. Show your child what the beach looks like in wild weather, or visit parks and gardens when the plants are all wet and glossy.</li>
	<li>Take your child to see how the flow of rivers, creeks and streams changes after rain.</li>
	<li>When it’s wet, dress up in gumboots and raincoats. Look for some big puddles to jump in. An umbrella can be fun to take along too. Your child might have fun opening and closing it a few times.</li>
	<li>If it’s darker, let your child play with a torch when you go out for a walk.</li>
	<li>Gather leaves, sticks, shells and stones from outside. You can take them inside and use them for sorting, painting or building.</li>
	<li>On a windy day, you can try flying kites, chasing leaves – or helping them ‘fly’ – and trying to find places to hide from the wind outside.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Free indoor winter activities</h2>

<p>If you can’t face the cold and wet, here are some ideas for winter activities you and your child can do inside at home:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Line up some empty plastic bottles inside and use an old pair of socks to play indoor ‘bowling’. Make it harder by adding some weight (like sand or water) inside the bottles. Your child could recycle the socks to play other games like soccer or tennis, or even puppet plays.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to throw a scarf up in the air and catch it on an arm, leg, knee or head. Or let your child kick a balloon up as high as possible and then use a fly swat or plastic bat to hit the balloon.</li>
	<li>Move to music, make up dances and play dress-ups. Maybe your child could act out a new adventure based on a favourite superhero or cartoon character.</li>
	<li>Set up an indoor treasure hunt.</li>
	<li>If you have space, use chairs, blankets and boxes to build a fort or set up an obstacle course.</li>
	<li>Use an old mattress as an indoor trampoline and get your child to try funny running styles, or practise jumping, landing and tumbling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Winter activities you need to pay for</h2>

<p>As a special treat, your child might enjoy some of these paid activities:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Indoor play centres, swimming, trampolining, ice-skating and ten-pin bowling can keep your child active inside.</li>
	<li>Traditional winter team sports like football, hockey, netball or rugby can be great for children when they’re old enough and want to play. Look for sports where the rules have been modified so they’re fun and safe for young children.</li>
	<li>If it’s not too far or expensive, a trip to the snow can be great fun for snow play or tobogganing.</li>

<p>Rough-and-tumble play is when children climb over each another, wrestle, roll around and even pretend to fight.</p>

<p>Most children love rough-and-tumble play. It lets them:</p>

<ul>
	<li>test and practise physical and social skills</li>
	<li>explore their position in space</li>
	<li>take some safe risks</li>
	<li>learn about their bodies, including how strong they are.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rough-and-tumble play is <strong>fun </strong>– and good exercise too!</p>

<h2>What you need for rough-and-tumble play</h2>

<p>You just need <strong>enough space</strong> for your child to enjoy rough-and-tumble play.</p>

<p>Rough-and-tumble play is usually pretty high energy, so it’s best to be in <strong>a place where nothing can get broken</strong>.</p>

<p>Rough-and-tumble play is fun outside – for example, in a garden or playground, at the beach, or on a big trampoline.</p>

<p>Your child can also have rough-and-tumble play inside – for example, on the couch or rug. You just have to be a bit gentler inside and not let things get out of control.</p>

<h2>How to enjoy rough-and-tumble play</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways for you and your child to enjoy rough-and-tumble play. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Play chasing games.</strong> This could be an exciting, high-speed game with your six-year-old at the park. Or it might be play-chasing your toddler down the hallway for a hug.</li>
	<li><strong>Wrestle.</strong> Lie down on the ground and see whether your child can roll you over or stop you getting up. Children often enjoy testing their strength in this way. You might have to play along a bit and pretend your child is stronger than you.</li>
	<li><strong>Have a tickle war</strong> on the couch. Just be careful not to bump into other furniture.</li>
	<li><strong>Growl like an animal</strong> or a monster and pretend to eat your child. A little bit of scary play can be fun, as long as your child still feels safe.</li>
	<li><strong>Go outside for a piggyback ride</strong>, or a game of holding hands and spinning and dancing. Soft grass is good if you fall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes children can get hurt in rough-and-tumble play, especially when they wrestle or play fight with each other. It can help to set some rules – for example, ‘No biting, no scratching, no pulling hair. If someone says “stop”, you have to stop’.</p>

	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Adapting for children of different ages</h2>

<p>You can adapt your play for your situation and your child’s age.</p>

<p>For example, just be gentler with your <strong>young child</strong>. Being bounced on your knee or lifted gently into the air like an aeroplane might be enough rough-and-tumble for your toddler.</p>

<p>Your <strong>older child</strong> probably plays rough with her friends, and she might need to be reminded to stop if the play stops being fun for everyone.</p>",86,55,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"76, 206, 81, 226, 231",,0,0,,en,published
66,Obstacles to physical activity: how to overcome them,"Common obstacles to children’s physical activity include time sitting still, space for play, busy schedules and screen time.
Look at how much time your child sits or is restrained, as well as your space, family schedule and approach to screen time.
With a few adjustments, you might be able to make more time and opportunities for physical activity.","<h2>Common obstacles to physical activity for children</h2>

<p>To grow and develop well through childhood, children of different ages need different amounts and types of physical activity each day.</p>

<p>But there are some common obstacles to children’s physical activity:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>long periods of sitting still</li>
	<li>the environment around your home</li>
	<li>busy family schedules</li>
	<li>screen time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that there are <strong>simple, practical and fun ways to overcome all of these obstacles </strong>and get more physical activity into your child’s day.</p>

<h2>Avoiding long periods of sitting still</h2>

<p>Being restrained or sitting still for too long can stop young children getting enough physical activity.</p>

<p>Australian guidelines say that children aged:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>1 year up to 5 years </strong>shouldn’t sit for extended periods or be restrained for more than one hour at a time – for example, in a stroller, car seat or high chair</li>
	<li><strong>5 years up to 18 years</strong> should break up long periods of sitting as often as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to <strong>overcome this obstacle</strong> is to let your child walk, move about or use a bike, scooter or push-along toy when you’re going somewhere. It might make your trip a bit slower, so plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time to get where you’re going.</p>

<p>There will be times when your child needs to be still or just wants to do something less active like reading and storytelling, singing, doing puzzles or playdough, and so on. Quiet activities and downtime are important too.</p>

<p>But if you think your child has been still for too long, you could encourage your child to get up and move. For example, a dance around the family room, a few star jumps or a bounce on the trampoline can break up a period of sitting still.</p>

<h2>Finding space for physical activity</h2>

<p>Sometimes the environment around your home can make physical activity more challenging.</p>

<p>For example, you might not have a lot of play space at home. Many parents also worry about the safety of their neighbourhoods, so children don’t spend much time playing together in the street or in parks. And some suburbs don’t have schools and shops within walking distance of home.</p>

<p>To <strong>overcome some of these obstacles</strong> you could:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>take your child to a park, sports field, beach, friend’s or family member’s house, library, school, community centre or other place with space to play</li>
	<li>talk to neighbours with other young children about sharing supervision outside or on the street</li>
	<li>park or get off the bus or train a little bit further from where you’re going, and walk the rest of the way with your child.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adjusting busy family schedules</h2>

<p>Busy family schedules can also get in the way of finding time to be physically active with children.</p>

<p>To <strong>overcome this obstacle</strong>, you might be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>adjust your schedule so you can walk or ride with your child to child care or school one or two days a week</li>
	<li>make time for physical activities like kicking a ball or playing in the park with your children when you’re not working.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could also talk with other parents or people in your community about helping each other. For example, you could take turns to supervise a group of children playing actively outside or walking to child care or school on different days.</p>

<h2>Balancing screen time with other activities</h2>

<p>Screen time is a normal part of life for most children, but sometimes it can mean children sit still for too long.</p>

<p>It’s all about balance. Screen time can be part of a healthy lifestyle when children also do lots of other activities, like physical activity, reading, creative play and social time with family and friends.</p>

<p>These seven tips can help you balance toddler and preschooler screen time and school-age screen time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make rules about screen use.</li>
	<li>Aim for short screen time sessions.</li>
	<li>Get your child moving, especially outside.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to imagine and create.</li>
	<li>Encourage play and friendship with others.</li>
	<li>Avoid screen time before bed.</li>
	<li>Keep screens out of bedrooms at night.</li>
</ul>

<p>And when your child does have screen time, why not use screen time to get your child moving? For example, you can try things like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>planning a walk with your child using a digital map</li>
	<li>videoing your child learning a new skill like skipping rope, and replaying the footage so your child can see himself learning</li>
	<li>choosing video dance games or virtual sports simulators for your child.</li>

	<li>Pens and pencils</li>
	<li>Staples, or a hole punch and string or ribbon</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to make a family story book</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Show your child the family photographs and talk about them. The photos might be of people your child knows well, like a sibling or parent. They might also be of people she doesn’t see often or people who have died. You could include pictures of people when they were younger, including yourself.</li>
	<li>Tell your child you’re going to make a family story book together. Let your child decide which pictures he wants to put in the book and what story he wants to tell. It could be a story about something your child remembers, like Roly the dog getting lost. Or it could be a story you’ve shared with him, like what happened the day he was born.</li>
	<li>Make the book by cutting out the pictures and gluing them on the pages.</li>
	<li>Write the story together. Encourage your child to decide what details to include and how to say things, rather than writing the story for her.</li>
	<li>Your child might like to draw pictures of people and things you don’t have photographs for, like family pets.</li>
	<li>Staple the pages together, or punch holes in them and tie them together with string or ribbon.</li>
	<li>Keep the book nearby so your child can read it. A home-made family story book is lovely to share together at bedtime. Your child might also like to show the book to other family members, carers or friends.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adapting a family story book for children of different ages</h2>

<p><strong>Your younger child</strong> might need help cutting and gluing the pictures. Try to guide your child by holding his hand while he uses the scissors, rather than just doing it for him.</p>

<p>Your younger child’s stories are likely to be very simple – for example, ‘This is Mummy. This is Daddy’. She’ll need you to write words and names for her. You can encourage her to try tracing over or copying letters and words as well.</p>

<p><strong>Your older child</strong> might be interested in who fits in where. He might be able to understand that Auntie Jayanthi is Daddy’s sister, for example. He might also be interested in things that happened before he was born, like how his grandparents came to the country.</p>",96,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"246, 156, 251, 196",,0,0,,en,published

<p>‘I spy’ is a simple game that you and your child can play anywhere.</p>

<p>‘I spy’ is a turn-taking game, so it helps to develop your child’s social skills. When your child waits for her turn, she’s learning how to play and cooperate with others.</p>

<p>‘I spy’ is also great for building your child’s vocabulary and understanding of language. That’s because your child has to think of the names of objects and the letters they begin with, if he can.</p>

<h2>What you need for ‘I spy’</h2>

<p>You can play this game anywhere. You just need to be able to look around and talk with your child. You don’t need any special equipment.</p>

<h2>How to play ‘I spy’</h2>

<p>Decide who starts. You could choose the youngest person, or the person whose name starts with the letter closest to the start of the alphabet.</p>

<p>The player who starts picks an object that everyone can see. The player gives the first letter of the object as a clue. For example, if the player chooses a fence, she says, ‘I spy with my little eye something beginning with F’.</p>

<p>Players take turns to call out guesses until someone gets the right answer. The first person to guess correctly gets the next turn to choose an object.</p>

<h2>Adapting ‘I spy’ for children of different ages</h2>

<p>You can easily adapt ‘I spy’ for older and younger children.</p>

<p>Your <strong>younger child</strong> can give his clue in a way that doesn’t involve letters. For example, he could say, ‘I spy with my little eye something that I can eat’ or ‘I spy with my little eye something that is red’.</p>

<p>Your <strong>older child</strong> could change the rules to make the game more interesting. For example, each player gets to ask three questions about the object with a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer before they take one guess.</p>

<p>But before your child learns to read and write, he needs to develop the building blocks for literacy – the ability to speak, listen, understand, watch and draw.  Give your child a rich foundation in ""oral language"" by having warm conversations, using interesting words, and reading aloud.</p>

<p>And as your child gets older, she also needs to learn about the connection between letters on a page and spoken sounds. For this to happen, she needs plenty of experience with:</p>

<ul>
	<li>pictures and objects – how you can use words to talk about them</li>
	<li>letters and words – their shapes, sounds and names</li>
	<li>sounds – how words can rhyme, and as she gets older, learning that words begin and end with the same letters, be broken up into parts like syllables, be formed by blending different sounds and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can help with all these areas of your child’s early literacy development by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>communicating with your child</li>
	<li>reading together</li>
	<li>playing with rhyme and other sounds with your child.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the great news is that <strong>you can do this in ways that are fun</strong> for both of you.</p>

<p>The language experiences that children have before they start school form powerful brain connections. These connections are used for language, thinking and understanding. Without activities like talking, singing and reading, the brain doesn’t develop these important connections.</p>

<h2>Communicating: its importance in literacy development</h2>

<p>Back-and-forth communication with your baby helps to develop your child’s ability to speak, listen and understand as he gets older.</p>

<p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Copy the sounds your baby makes. It’s OK to use <strong>baby talk</strong>.  Babies love it, and it helps babies understand how language is put together.</li>
	<li>Sing with your child. </li>
	<li>Talk with your child about the everyday things you’re doing and seeing together. For example, ‘Let’s get the washing now’, ‘Look at the red bird’ or ‘Yum, what a nice lunch we’re having’.</li>
	<li>Talk about feelings and chat about whether your child is happy or sad.</li>
	<li>Share stories with your child. You could share stories from your childhood or tell your child about your family’s past. You could take turns creating a story together.</li>
	<li>Listen to your child. If he asks a question, give him the chance to come up with answers before you step in. For example, if your child says, ‘What’s that box there?’, you could say, ‘What do you think it is?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reading: its importance in literacy development</h2>

<p><strong>Read with your child often</strong>. It’s best to start reading from birth, but it’s never too late to begin.</p>

<p><strong>What you can do</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose lift-the flap books, touch-and-feel books or books with rhyming or repeating words for younger children.</li>
	<li>Make reading together a happy, interactive experience--say things like ""Oh, what will happen next?"" ""See the girl with the ball?  You have a ball!""</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to hold the book and turn the pages. This helps him start to understand that the book should be a certain way up, and that pages are always turned in the same direction.</li>
	<li>With older preschoolers, sometimes slide your finger underneath the words as you read them, pointing out each word.</li>
	<li>Point out pictures and talk about the pictures your child points to.</li>
	<li>Make the sounds of animals or other objects in the book – have fun!</li>
	<li>Visit the library. There are lots of different types of books you can borrow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rhyme: its importance in literacy development</h2>

<p>Rhyming is a great way to teach children the connection between the sound of a word and how it’s written.</p>

<h3><strong>What you can do</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Play games that involve rhyming. Rhyming games help children appreciate beginning and ending sounds – for example, ‘cat, pat and mat’. You can play them at any time – in the car, while shopping or at the dinner table.</li>
	<li>Play games that involve the sound and rhythm of words. You could try ‘I spy’ and tongue twisters like ‘She sells seashells by the seashore’.</li>
	<li>Read rhyming books like <em>The Cat in the hat</em> or <em>Doodledum dancing</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might like to read about more activities to encourage early language and literacy. And if you’re worried that your child might be having early literacy difficulties, it’s a good idea to talk with a professional, like your  health provider or your child’s early childhood teacher.</p>",106,55,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"196, 246, 261, 266, 271",,1,0,,en,published

206,Re-establishment of breastfeeding - relactation,"<p>If you have interrupted breastfeeding for any reason and decided to breastfeed your baby again, success is possible! You need, first of all, a great desire, as well as time, patience, consistency and support.</p>","<p>Relactation may be needed if your baby was sick and could not suckle, if you did not express milk while you were separated from the baby, if you did not breastfeed at first but now want to, if you were sick and stopped breastfeeding because you used some medications. Sometimes even an adoptive mother manages to establish lactation, if she previously breastfed her biological children.</p>

<p>As with breastfeeding, the mother's motivation and perseverance are crucial for relactation. It is necessary to be close to the child, cuddle, play, not only during feeding, but whenever the child is awake.</p>

<p>How long it takes to re-establish lactation is individual and depends on the baby's age and the time that has elapsed since you stopped lactation. That period may be 2 weeks, but also a month.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure you and your baby have a comfortable breastfeeding position.</li>
	<li>Try to eat regularly; drink a glass of water before each breastfeed.</li>
	<li>Put the baby to the breast 10-12 times a day.</li>
	<li>Check how the baby latches on the breast.</li>
	<li>Nighttime breastfeeds are indispensable; a sleepy baby sucks more easily.</li>
	<li>Feed the baby formula with a teaspoon, syringe, cup or relactation system.</li>
	<li>When you feel that the breasts are filled with milk before breastfeeding and empty after breastfeeding, that the baby actively suckles, that you can feel him/her pulling milk out, swallowing, then gradually reduce the amount of formula by 10-30 ml per day.</li>
	<li>The baby's body weight should be measured regularly.</li>
	<li>Keep track of the number of stools and the number of wet diapers per day.</li>
	<li>Increase fluid intake and caloric value of food.</li>
	<li>Provide family support, to have enough time for relactation.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The relactation system</em> can be purchased at pharmacies or improvised at home with a baby infusion system. If formula feeding is the dominant milk intake, and breastfeeding occurs sporadically, then the ideal way to re-establish lactation, through regular breast stimulation, is through the use of a relactation system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As with breastfeeding, the mother's motivation and perseverance are crucial for relactation. It is necessary to be close to the child, cuddle, play, not only during feeding, but whenever the child is awake. Relactation will be easier if the child is very young (under two months) and is not used to bottle feeding, or if the mother has recently stopped breastfeeding.</p>

211,Colic: what is it?,"Babies who cry or fuss a lot and can’t be settled are often described as having ‘colic’. We don’t know what causes colic, but we do know it can be hard to handle.","<h2>What is colic?</h2>

<p>Colic is <strong>crying and fussing</strong> that happens a lot, or lasts for a long time. It might start when your baby is a few days or a few weeks old.</p>

<p>If your baby has colic, he’ll be <strong>unsettled and fussy about feeding</strong>. For example, he might feed hungrily, but soon after a feed he seems to be hungry again. Or your baby might not feed well, often fussing at the breast or bottle.</p>

<p>You might find that your baby <strong>spends long periods unsettled or grizzling</strong>, but she might also cry very loudly. During this crying period, your baby might draw her legs up, as if in pain. It’s very difficult or even impossible to settle or comfort your baby when she’s in this state. Nothing you do seems to make any difference.</p>

<p>The crying and fussing might seem to go on for hours, and it’s often worse in the evening.</p>

<p>It can be <strong>very upsetting for you</strong>, and often frustrating for other carers, doctors and nurses as well. But if your baby cries and fusses, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent. The most confident and calm parents can also have babies who cry a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few babies with ‘colic’ symptoms have medical problems, so it’s a good idea to see your doctor to rule this out if your baby is crying a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Crying and fussing: what to expect</h2>

<p><strong>Crying and fussing are normal</strong> for babies. On average, babies cry and fuss for almost three hours a day – and some for a lot longer than this. The crying reaches a peak at about six weeks of age, and then gradually lessens as babies get older.</p>

<p>Most of this crying and fussing seems to happen in the <strong>late afternoon and evening</strong>, although this can change from day to day.</p>

<p>Younger babies cry because of their temperament, sleeping cycles and feeding patterns. As babies get older, their crying is more about communicating with you or about something in their environment. Because of this, it’s more likely to be spread throughout the day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s natural for you to worry about your baby’s crying. <strong>It might help to know that most babies cry less by 3-4 months of age</strong>. This is a phase that will soon pass.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Causes of colic</h2>

<p>We still don’t know much about what causes colic.</p>

<p>Colic might be caused by too much stimulation. Crying might help a newborn take control of his environment. It’s as if your baby is saying, ‘Enough! I’m just going to cry to shut out the world’.</p>

<p>It might help you to know that most ‘colicky’ babies have <strong>no obvious physical or medical cause</strong> for their crying. But if your baby is fussing and crying a lot, it’s a good idea to see your doctor to rule out these possible causes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>gastroesophageal reflux – a rare but possible cause of crying</li>
	<li>infection – for example, ear infections or urinary tract infections</li>
	<li>hernia – for example, inguinal or umbilical hernias</li>
	<li>allergy – for example, to mother’s diet or to cow’s milk</li>
	<li>nappy rash or other source of irritation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soothing strategies may include:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Taking your infant for a car ride or on a walk in a stroller</li>
	<li>Walking around with or rocking your baby</li>
	<li>Giving your baby a warm bath</li>
	<li>Rubbing your infant's tummy or placing your baby on the tummy for a back rub</li>
	<li>Playing an audio of heartbeats or quiet, soothing sounds</li>
	<li>Dimming the lights and limiting other visual stimulation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parent self-care</h3>

<p>Caring for an infant who has colic can be exhausting even for experienced parents. some simple steps might help you take care of yourself:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take turns with your spouse or partner, or a friend.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't judge yourself  </strong>and <strong>Remember that it's temporary.</strong> Colic episodes often improve after age 3 to 4 months.</li>
	<li>If necessary, contact your doctor.</li>

226,Diarrhoea,"Diarrhoea is large, runny, frequent or watery stool. It’s common in children.
If your child is under three months old and has diarrhoea, see your doctor. If your child has diarrhoea and could be dehydrated, go to a doctor or hospital straight away. If your child has diarrhoea, make sure that she has enough to drink. It’s best to use an oral rehydration fluid.","<h2>What is diarrhoea?</h2>

<p>Diarrhoea is large, runny, frequent or watery poo. It’s common in children.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of diarrhoea</h2>

<p>If your child has diarrhoea, he’ll have large, runny, frequent or watery poo. The colour of the poo might vary from brown to green, and you might notice bits of partially broken down food in the poo. </p>

<p>Other symptoms that might come with diarrhoea include stomach pain or cramps, bloating, nausea, vomiting or fever.</p>

<p>Diarrhoea might lead to dehydration, which can be a serious problem.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about diarrhoea?</h2>

<p>If your child is under three months old and has diarrhoea, always see your GP.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea to see your doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has chronic (prolonged) diarrhoea</li>
	<li>has blood in her poo</li>
	<li>is losing weight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take your child to a<strong> hospital emergency department </strong>straight away if he has diarrhoea and:</p>

<ul>
	<li>he shows signs of dehydration – that is, if he isn’t passing urine, is pale and thin, has sunken eyes, cold hands and cold feet, is drowsy or is very cranky</li>
	<li>he can’t keep fluids down and has severe stomach pain or stomach pain that won’t go away</li>
	<li>you’re worried that he’s very unwell.</li>
</ul>

<p>You know your child best, so trust your instincts if your child doesn’t seem well. Signs that your child has a serious illness that requires urgent medical attention include severe pain, drowsiness, pale or blue skin, dehydration, troubled breathing, seizures and reduced responsiveness.</p>

<h2>Tests for diarrhoea</h2>

<p>If the diarrhoea is caused by a specific virus, bacteria or parasite, a test of your child’s poo will show what the problem is.</p>

<p>If the diarrhoea is chronic, your doctor might order some blood and poo tests to look for other underlying causes.</p>

<h2>Treatment for diarrhoea</h2>

<p><strong>Fluids</strong><br />
The most important thing is to <strong>make sure that your child has enough to drink</strong>.</p>

<p>Give your child small amounts to drink often – for example, a few mouthfuls every 15 minutes. It’s best to use an oral rehydration fluid like Gastrolyte®, Hydralyte™, Pedialyte® or Repalyte®. You can buy these fluids over the counter from a pharmacy. </p>

<p>If you can’t get oral rehydration solution, you can use <strong>diluted lemonade, cordial or fruit juice</strong>. Use one part of lemonade or juice to four parts of water. Full-strength lemonade, cordial or fruit juice might make the diarrhoea worse, so don’t give these to your child.</p>

<p>If you have a <strong>young breastfed baby</strong>, keep breastfeeding but feed more often. You can give your child extra oral rehydration solution between feeds. If your baby is bottle fed, give her oral rehydration fluid for the first 24 hours only and then reintroduce full-strength formula in smaller more frequent feeds. You can still offer extra oral rehydration fluids between feeds.</p>

<h3><strong>Food</strong><br />
Your child might refuse food to start with. If your child is hungry, you can give him whatever he feels like eating. Don’t stop food for more than 24 hours.</h3>

<p><strong>Additional treatments</strong><br />
If your child is very dehydrated or can’t keep any oral fluids down, she might need fluids to be given directly into a vein through a drip or through a tube that goes up her nose and into her stomach. In this case, she’ll have to go into hospital.</p>

<p>Don’t treat your child with antidiarrhoeal medications. There’s no evidence to show that these treatments work. Your child probably doesn’t need antibiotics either, but your doctor will tell you about the best treatment options for your child.</p>

<h2>Preventing diarrhoea</h2>

<p>If your child has had gastroenteritis and diarrhoea, you can help prevent the spread of this infection by making sure everyone in the family <strong>washes their hands regularly</strong> and doesn’t share drink bottles, cups or food utensils.</p>

<p>It’s best to keep your child away from other children and school or child care until he’s had no diarrhoea for at least 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Chronic (prolonged) diarrhoea</h2>

<p><strong>Chronic diarrhoea</strong> might be caused by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>types of lactose (the <em>sugar</em> component of <em>milk) </em>intolerance</li>
	<li>parasitic infections like Giardia</li>
	<li>coeliac disease</li>
	<li>food intolerances</li>
	<li>irritable bowel syndrome</li>
	<li>other less common conditions like inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some <strong>toddlers with chronic diarrhoea</strong> might be drinking too much fruit juice. But we don’t know what causes diarrhoea in many toddlers.

Keeping your baby’s genitals clean helps to prevent infections and keep your baby healthy.
To clean your baby’s genitals, use warm water and a cotton ball. You don’t need soap.","<h2>Genital hygiene for babies</h2>

<p>It’s important to keep your baby’s genitals clean. This will help prevent infections and keep your baby healthy.</p>

<p>To clean your baby’s genitals, you can use warm water and a cotton ball. You don’t need to use always soap. If you do use soap, choose a mild one with a built-in moisturiser, and use only a small amount. Always make sure to wash all the soap off your baby’s genitals.</p>

<p>You can clean your baby’s genitals when changing her nappy and at bath times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Avoid using talcum powder anywhere on your baby, including around baby’s genitals. Talcum powder has fine particles that your baby can breathe in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Cleaning your son’s penis</h2>

<p><strong>If your baby boy is circumcised</strong><br />
If your son is circumcised, gently wash your baby’s penis and scrotum with warm water and a cotton ball. Dry your baby’s penis and scrotum by patting dry with a soft towel.</p>

<p>To prevent your baby’s penis from sticking to the nappy, it’s a good idea to moisten the front of the nappy with petroleum jelly, pawpaw cream or something similar.</p>

<p><strong>If your baby boy is uncircumcised</strong><br />
If your son is uncircumcised, you need to clean only the <strong>outside of the foreskin.</strong> You can clean inside the foreskin when it easily pulls back on its own. This usually happens when your boy is 2-3 years old, but sometimes it might not happen until puberty.</p>

<p>It’s normal for a milky white substance (called smegma) to gather under the foreskin. This is just made of dead skin cells and natural secretions.</p>

<h2>Cleaning your daughter’s labia</h2>

<p>Nappy creams, sweat and other substances can collect in and around the labia. In general, you only need to clean the labia to remove traces of poo.</p>

<p>To clean your baby girl’s labia, wet a cotton ball, hold your baby’s legs apart and wipe between the labia with the cotton ball. Start at the front and gently wipe backwards. Lightly pat your baby’s genital area dry with a soft towel.</p>

<p>Don’t use vaginal deodorants or douches. They can upset the natural chemical balance of your baby’s vagina and increase the risk of infection.</p>

<p>You might notice a <strong>discharge</strong> that looks a bit like egg white. This is perfectly normal, and you don’t need to clean it away. If you’re unsure about any other discharge, see your doctor or nurse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s common for newborn baby girls to have small quantitiy of bloody vaginal discharge in the first few weeks. This is a normal response to mum’s hormones, so there’s no need to be alarmed. But if this discharge doesn’t go away, you should contact your doctor.</p>

236,"Cleaning baby eyes, nose and ears","Your baby’s eyes, nose and ears need gentle cleaning once a day.","<h2>Cleaning baby’s eyes, ears and nose: basics</h2>

<p>You can clean your baby’s eyes, ears and nose when you’re bathing him. Warm water is all you need. Avoid using soap because your baby’s skin is sensitive, and soap can dry it out.</p>

<h2>Steps for cleaning baby’s face</h2>

<p>Here are the basic steps for cleaning baby eyes, baby ears and baby noses:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get some cotton balls.</li>
	<li>Soak one cotton ball in some warm water.</li>
	<li>Clean the corners of your baby’s eyes, wiping gently from the inside corners to the outside corners.</li>
	<li>Use a new cotton ball for each eye.</li>
	<li>Wipe gently around each nostril to get rid of mucus. It’s <strong>best not to put anything inside your baby’s nostrils </strong>(including cotton buds). This can hurt the lining of the nose and cause bleeding.</li>
	<li>Wipe behind your baby’s ears and around the outside of each ear. Be careful not to stick anything (including cotton buds) inside her ear, because it’s very easy to cause damage.</li>
	<li>Wipe gently under your baby’s chin and neck, making sure you wipe between the folds of skin.</li>
	<li>Gently pat your baby’s skin dry using a soft towel. Make sure you dry under the skin folds and behind his ears.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your baby might get upset when you try to clean her face. Talking gently to her or singing a song can help with this.</p>

241,Umbilical care,"The baby belly button is what’s left of the umbilical cord after birth. Before birth this cord channels nutrients and oxygen from mother to baby in the womb. When the cord is cut at birth, a small stump is left attached to baby’s tummy.","<h2>Your baby’s umbilical stump: what to expect</h2>

<p>After your baby’s birth, her umbilical cord is cut. Your midwife puts a plastic clamp or tie on the stump that’s left behind. The clamp is taken off after a day or two, when the umbilical stump has dried and sealed.</p>

<p>During the first few days after birth, <strong>the stump will get darker and shrivel, and will eventually fall off</strong>. Sometimes it takes a week or two. If the stump hasn’t fallen off after more than 3 weeks, you can check with your child and family health nurse.</p>

<p>While the stump is drying up and just after it falls off, you might notice some <strong>oozing around the baby belly button</strong>. This might be clear, sticky or brownish, and it might leave a mark on your baby’s clothes or nappy. It might also smell a little. This is a normal part of the healing process.</p>

<h2>Cleaning and caring for your baby’s belly button</h2>

<p><strong>Wash your hands</strong> before handling the cord stump, and avoid touching it whenever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Use water to keep your baby’s belly button area clean.</strong> You don’t usually need to use soap, creams, antiseptics or alcohol to clean it, and you don’t need to bandage the belly button.</p>

<p><strong>Make sure the stump dries properly after bathing.</strong> The stump will dry and heal much faster if you expose it to air as much as possible. Try not to cover it with plastic pants and nappies. Fold nappies down and away from the stump if you can.</p>

<p>If the stump gets wee or poo on it, wash it off using clean water and a pH-neutral cleanser. </p>

<p><strong>Never try to pull the stump off yourself</strong>, even if it looks like it’s ready to fall off.</p>

<h2>Umbilical granuloma</h2>

<p>Once the stump has fallen off, some babies can develop an umbilical granuloma. This usually looks like a small pink or red lump where the belly button should be. Sometimes the lump might be oozing.</p>

<p>An umbilical granuloma is usually harmless, but you should ask your doctor or child nurse to have a look at it.</p>

<h2>Umbilical hernia</h2>

<p>If your baby develops a <strong>bulge or swelling near his belly button,</strong> it might be an umbilical hernia. An umbilical hernia is often more noticeable when your baby cries or strains to do a poo. This usually isn’t dangerous, and it doesn’t hurt your baby.</p>

<p>An umbilical hernias will probably close on their own in the first two years of life, though some remain open into the fifth year or longer.</p>

246,Trimming baby nails,"You don’t need to cut baby nails very often. It can help to cut nails while your baby is calm or drowsy, or try singing or distracting baby in some other way. Babies might get an infection around the fingernail or toenail. If you see signs of infection, see your doctor.","<h2>About your baby’s nails</h2>

<p>You don’t need to cut baby nails very often.</p>

<p>In newborns, nails are soft and wear down by themselves through contact with your baby’s clothing. Older babies wear down their nails while playing and interacting with their surroundings.</p>

<p><strong>Too long and sharp nail may cause scratches in the body including the eyes</strong>. Baby nails do grow quite fast, though, so you can <strong>trim fingernails and toenails as needed</strong>. You can use special baby nail scissors or nail clippers. You can also file nails using an emery board. This means just rounding off the nails so they’re smooth.</p>

<h2>How to cut your baby’s nails</h2>

<p>Try to cut baby nails <strong>when your newborn is asleep, very calm or drowsy</strong>. </p>

<p>These tips for cutting nails can make things easier:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Make sure you have plenty of light, so you can see well.</li>
	<li>Work with someone else if it helps – one holds your baby as the other trims the nails.</li>
	<li>Gently pull your baby’s finger pad away from the nail to avoid cutting the skin.</li>
	<li>Trim toenails straight across to prevent ingrown nails.</li>
</ul>

<p>And here are some tips to keep your baby happy as you cut nails:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Talk calmly or sing to your baby.</li>
	<li>Try distracting your baby with a toy or activity. This often works well with older babies.</li>
	<li>Praise your baby for helping you finish. This can help you both feel good about getting the job done.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <strong>you accidentally cut your baby’s skin and it bleeds</strong>, gently press a soft cloth pad onto the cut until the bleeding stops. Don’t put on a dressing because your baby might suck it off.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about the cut, take your baby to see your doctor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Young babies tend to scratch themselves accidentally because they don’t have a lot of control over their hands and legs. They also love to explore their face with their hands which is a set up for a scratched eye.You can stop babies from scratching by covering their hands with a pair of soft cotton mittens or socks. But make sure your baby has some mitten-free time to explore and play with their hands.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of scratched eye include:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Red eye – the “whites” of the eye will be very sore and red</li>
	<li>Excessive tears</li>
	<li>Yor baby is Suddenly fussy</li>
	<li>Scratch marks around the eye</li>
	<li>Symptoms in only one eye.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you suspect your child has an eye scratch see your doctor who will decide wether to put local ointment to the eye. But don’t worry! Most eye scratches are not too serious and will heal perfectly with proper treatment</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Baby nail problems</h2>

<p>It’s quite common for young babies to get a small infection (called paronychia) around a fingernail or toenail. This often clears up without needing treatment. But you might need to put a small amount of antiseptic cream or liquid on the nail.</p>

<p>Sometimes this infection can spread further into the skin of the finger or toe, causing the area to become swollen and red.</p>

<p>If you notice this, <strong>see your doctor</strong>. Your baby might need an antibiotic to help clear the infection. If you do put on cream to treat the infection, make sure that you put mittens or socks on your baby afterwards. This means baby can’t put their hands or feet directly into their mouth.</p>",2071,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49",59,60,"131, 3976, 4791, 4796",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/hygiene-keeping-clean/trimming-nails"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/hygiene-keeping-clean/trimming-nails</a></p>",en,published
251,Poos and wees,"Key points:

- Plenty of clear, colourless wee shows that your baby is healthy and getting enough fluids.
- The frequency, colour, consistency and smell of baby poo varies a lot among babies.
- Baby poo is affected by baby diet.
- Poo problems include constipation and diarrhoea. It’s best to see your GP about poo problems.","<h2>Wee: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Young babies can wee many times a day.</p>

<p><strong>Plenty of wet nappies is a good sign</strong> – it shows that your baby is getting enough milk and other fluids. The wetting will happen less as your baby gets older, but it might still happen at least 6-8 times a day.</p>

<p>Every time your baby wees, <strong>look at the stream or colour of the wee stain</strong> on the nappy. This tells you a lot about your baby’s health.</p>

<p>Plenty of clear, colourless wee is normal. A heavy nappy is a sign that there’s plenty of wee. Infrequent or darker wee is a sign that your baby might be dehydrated or not getting enough fluids.</p>

<p>Light pink or orange stains are nothing to worry about. They’re caused by the wee reacting with chemicals in the nappy and are quite common. Also, sometimes there can be small ‘crystals’ on the inner surface of a disposable nappy. These come from the inside of the nappy, not from your baby.</p>

<p>If the wee stains are red or brown, and you think there might be blood in the wee or your baby doesn’t seem well, see your GP immediately.</p>

<h2>Poo: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Your newborn’s <strong>first poo</strong> will be a dark green, tar-like substance called meconium. This is normal – it’s your baby’s stomach and bowel contents emptying after being in the womb for nine months. You might see some dark green poos for a few days.</p>

<p>After this, there’s a <strong>big range of normal</strong> when it comes to what baby poo looks and smells like and how often babies poo.</p>

<p>Some babies poo several times a day, and some poo only a few times a week. This is normal.</p>

<p>Pooing is common during or shortly after feeding. This is called the gastro-colic reflex.</p>

<p>As the weeks and months pass, <strong>you can expect changes in poo</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>frequency</li>
	<li>colour</li>
	<li>consistency – it can be firm, runny and everything in between</li>
	<li>smell – it generally gets smellier when baby starts eating solids.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How diet affects poo</h2>

<p>The way your baby’s poo looks might depend on your baby’s diet.</p>

<p><strong>Breastmilk</strong><br />
The poo:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>will be quite soft and maybe even runny, a bit like mustard, often a yellow-orange colour, but sometimes green</li>
	<li>might get less frequent but will stay quite soft until baby starts eating solid food</li>
	<li>can smell quite sweet, and the smell can be affected by what mum is eating.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Formula</strong><br />
The poo:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>is generally firmer but can vary a lot in colour and consistency</li>
	<li>can be grey-yellow (or even grey-blue), or some shades of brown.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Change from one formula to another</strong><br />
This can lead to changes in appearance and consistency of poo.</p>

<p><strong>Solids</strong><br />
The poo:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>becomes firmer and smellier once you introduce solids</li>
	<li>can look as if some solids are undigested. This is because your baby’s digestive system is still developing. It’s usually normal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Poo problems</h2>

<p><strong>Constipation</strong><br />
Constipation is when the poo is hard and dry, and looks like little marbles or pebbles. This kind of poo is difficult for your baby to push out, which can be upsetting for your baby.</p>

<p>Constipation is more likely to happen in bottle-fed babies. It usually happens when the formula has been made with too little water.</p>

<p>Babies might also get constipated when they start solid food. This normally sorts itself out in a few weeks.</p>

<p>If your baby is straining and pooing hard, dry pebbles or if you see blood in the poo, speak to your GP or child and family health nurse.</p>

<p><strong>Diarrhoea</strong><br />
Diarrhoea is when your baby does very runny or even watery poos, more often than usual. If your baby is vomiting as well, it might be a gut infection. In this situation, it’s important to see your GP immediately to make sure that your baby doesn’t get dehydrated.</p>

<p><strong>Pale poo</strong><br />
If a baby with jaundice also has pale yellow, white or grey poo, see your GP immediately – this can be a sign of a rare liver disease. The baby will need a blood test to check. Take photos or even samples of your baby’s poo with you so the GP can check it out.</p>",9056,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49",59,60,"956, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/poos-wees-nappies/poos-wees"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/poos-wees-nappies/poos-wees</a></p>",en,published
261,Nappy rash,Nappy rash is common and can happen no matter how carefully you look after your baby’s bottom. Almost all children who wear nappies get nappy rash at some stage.,"<h2>Causes of nappy rash</h2>

<p>Many things can combine to cause nappy rash in your child.</p>

<p>The <strong>main cause is wearing a wet or dirty nappy for too long</strong>. Prolonged dampness, friction and ammonia substances released from wee can irritate your child’s skin.</p>

<p>Plastic pants often make nappy rash worse because they stop air circulating normally and keep the nappy area damp.</p>

<p>Soaps and detergents left on cloth nappies after washing can also contribute to nappy rash.</p>

<p>Sometimes children also have other conditions like eczema, psoriasis, thrush or impetigo, which might make nappy rash worse.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of nappy rash</h2>

<p>The skin on your child’s bottom will look red and sore. Some areas of skin might be raised or swollen, and there might be breaks in the skin. These breaks are called ulcers.</p>

<p>The rash can cause discomfort and pain, which can make your baby irritable.</p>

<h2>When to see a doctor about nappy rash</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the GP if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the rash hasn’t improved after one week, even when you use the treatment steps below</li>
	<li>blisters, crusts or pimples appear</li>
	<li>your child is upset and isn’t sleeping</li>
	<li>your child has an unexplained fever</li>
	<li>the rash is spreading</li>
	<li>the end of your son’s penis is red and swollen, or has a scab on it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nappy rash treatment</h2>

<p>Simple measures are often the best. Nappy rash will usually get better or go away within a few days of taking the following steps.</p>

<p><strong>Change your baby’s nappies frequently</strong> <br />
Frequent nappy changes keep the nappy area dry and give your child’s skin a chance to heal. Check your child every hour or so to see whether his nappy is wet or soiled. Change wet or soiled nappies straight away. Disposable nappies are better for nappy rash because they absorb more moisture.</p>

<p><strong>Let your baby’s bottom ‘air’</strong> <br />
Give your baby’s bottom some air for as long as possible every day. You can leave baby lying on an open nappy or a towel (naked from the waist down) even while she’s sleeping. You can also try fastening her nappy loosely, to allow air to circulate freely.</p>

<p><strong>Clean your baby’s skin</strong> <br />
Use lukewarm water and cotton wool or a light cotton cloth to gently wash your baby’s skin after each nappy change.</p>

<p>Avoid using disposable wipes because they can irritate your baby’s skin, and some babies might be allergic to the preservatives in them.</p>

<p>When you bath your baby, use a gentle, soap-free wash and avoid soaps or bubble baths. After bathing, pat your baby’s skin dry and apply a simple moisturiser.</p>

<p><strong>Use an appropriate protective cream after each nappy change</strong> <br />
Apply a simple, cheap barrier cream with every nappy change. Barrier creams include zinc and castor oil or Vaseline. You can get these creams from a supermarket or your pharmacy without a prescription. Put the cream on thickly to stop wee or poo touching your baby’s skin. If you’re putting it on thickly enough, you’ll still be able to see some of the cream at the next nappy change.</p>

<p>Talcum-based powders aren’t recommended for nappy rash. If a baby accidentally breathes in a puff of talcum powder, it can cause breathing difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>Medications</strong> <br />
For severe nappy rash or nappy rash that won’t go away with simple measures, your doctor might recommend using corticosteroid creams or ointments like hydrocortisone 1%. The doctor might also recommend ointments containing also antibacterial and antifungal drugs. </p>

<h2>Nappy rash prevention</h2>

<p>Always keep your child’s nappy area clean and dry. Change your child’s nappy frequently and give his bottom air as often as you can.</p>

<p>Protective barrier creams like Vaseline or zinc and castor oil can help keep your child’s skin in good condition.</p>",9051,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50",59,60,"1161, 4811, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/poos-wees-nappies/nappy-rash"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/poos-wees-nappies/nappy-rash</a></p>",en,published
266,Temperament: what it is and why it matters,Children are born with their own ways of responding to the world. This is called temperament. Understanding your child’s temperament can help you choose parenting strategies that nurture your child’s development.,"<h2>Temperament: what is it?</h2>

<p>Temperament is the way children respond to the world.</p>

<p>You can think about your child’s temperament in terms of how much or how little he shows of these three qualities:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Reactivity</strong>: this is how strongly children react to things like exciting events or not getting their own way. Reactive children tend to feel things strongly.</li>
	<li><strong>Self-regulation</strong>: this is how much children can control their behaviour, including the way they show their feelings. It Is also about how much children can control their attention and how persistent they are.</li>
	<li><strong>Sociability</strong>: this is how comfortable children are when they meet new people or have new experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each child is born with her own temperament, and you have probably been able to describe your child’s temperament since she was a baby. For example, ‘She’s very easygoing’ or ‘She likes her routines’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Differences in temperament explain why your children might be quite different from one another. For example, your children might be more or less reactive, more or less self-regulated, and more or less sociable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Adapting your parenting for your child’s temperament</h2>

<p>You cannot change your child’s temperament – he is who he is, and that is great.</p>

<p>But you can <strong>adapt your parenting to your child’s individual temperament </strong>so that you nurture her development. You can help your child develop the positive parts of her temperament. And you can understand the situations that your child might find hard because of her temperament, and help her learn how to handle these situations.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for adapting your parenting to your child’s temperament.</p>

<h2>Parenting more and less reactive temperaments</h2>

<p><strong>More reactive</strong><br />
If you have a very reactive child, he is probably a lot of fun when something good happens. But he might also be loud and dramatic when he is unhappy about something, like not getting his own way. You might need to help this child learn how to respond more calmly – for example, by relaxing and using words for angry feelings.</p>

<p>Reactive children are often also <strong>very physically active</strong> and might need lots of time outdoors. You can help your child develop by encouraging her to try new sporting activities, for example. But she might also need help winding down, so bedtime relaxation can be a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>Less reactive</strong><br />
A less reactive child is usually easy to get along with, but might be less assertive. You might need to teach this child how to stand up for himself. For example, if you notice situations where your child could be more assertive, you could get him to practise handling those situations differently.</p>

<p>It is also important to make sure less reactive children are not left out of family discussions. For example, ‘Gul, you have not said much. Are you happy with that choice of movie?’</p>

<p>Children who are less reactive might also be <strong>less physically active</strong>. Your less active child will be happiest with lots of opportunities to use her fine motor skills, like doing craft or drawing. But you might need to encourage physical activity. Try a trip to the park to collect leaves for a collage, for example. Or make sure you both walk to the library, instead of driving.</p>

<h2>Parenting more and less self-regulated temperaments</h2>

<p><strong>More self-regulated</strong><br />
Children who find it easier to self-regulate are good at managing their reactions to emotions like frustration or excitement. They can calm down faster after something exciting or upsetting, and they are less impulsive.</p>

<p>A child who is very self-regulated might be more able to regulate his attention. He might be likely to keep going with something until he has got it right. He might also be good at coping with setbacks and able to get through tasks like homework without much supervision. But he might be a bit of a perfectionist, so make sure he knows that it is okay to make mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Less self-regulated</strong><br />
If your child has difficulty regulating her attention, she will need lots of encouragement to keep going at difficult tasks. These children might switch quickly from one activity to another. They can also be very creative. To help your child focus, you can try rewarding your child or making things fun by using games and creative activities.</p>

<h2>Parenting more and less sociable temperaments</h2>

<p><strong>More sociable</strong><br />
If your child is <strong>very social</strong> he will like being around other people, having playdates and doing group activities. But you do not have to organise playdates and activities for him all the time, because it is also important for your child to learn to occupy himself.</p>

<p>Children with more sociable temperaments are also usually <strong>very adaptable</strong> and can cope with changes to routines quite easily. It is great if you can give your adaptable child lots of new experiences, but make sure she still gets one-on-one time with you.</p>

<p><strong>Less sociable</strong><br />
If your child is not very social, he is probably quite good at playing by himself and might not need much help finding something to do. But you might need to help him with making friends. If he is not comfortable in groups or at parties, for example, you could try asking just one or two friends for a playdate at your house or the park.</p>

<p>If your less sociable child <strong>is not very adaptable</strong> she will like having a regular routine, and might not cope well with changes. This can make it easy for you to plan things around her routine, but your child might also need help coping with changes or transitions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your child’s temperament might be different from yours. Some parents find that it is easier to understand and care for a child whose temperament is similar to theirs. For example, if you like predictability, you might find it easy to care for a baby who needs regular sleeps. But if you like being able to do things whenever you want, it might take you a while to get used to your child’s liking for routine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How temperament can change</h2>

<p>You might see some changes in your child’s temperament as your child becomes more mature. This happens as your child’s experiences affect the way he behaves in different situations.</p>

<p>For example, a child who used to be very distracted at school might become an adult who can concentrate well in business meetings. This might be because she has developed more motivation as she has matured, or because she has learned strategies to manage her distraction.</p>",5561,6,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1046, 5146",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/temperament"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/temperament</a></p>",en,published
271,Corrected age: how old is your premature baby?,"Key points:
- Corrected age is your premature baby’s chronological age minus how many weeks or months early she was.
- Corrected age can be helpful if you are trying to work out whether your premature baby’s growth and development is tracking in a typical way.
- If you are worried about your child’s growth and development, see your doctor.","<h2>Corrected age: what is it?</h2>

<p>Corrected age, or adjusted age, is your premature baby’s <strong>chronological age minus the number of weeks or months he was born early</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, a one-year-old who was born three months early would have a corrected age of nine months.</p>

<h2>Why corrected age is important</h2>

<p>Corrected age can be helpful if you are trying to work out whether your premature baby’s development is tracking in a typical way. For example, if someone notices that your child is six months old but not sitting up yet, you could explain that she was born three months early. If you look at her corrected age, she is really only three months old and she is doing everything a three-month-old usually does.</p>

<p>Corrected age is especially relevant during your child’s early years, because it might explain things that look like lags in development in these years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are giving your child a first birthday party, you should celebrate his birthday one year from when he was born, regardless of corrected age!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How corrected age affects different areas of growth and development</h2>

<p>All children have variations in growth and development, regardless of whether they were premature or full term.</p>

<p>Being premature can affect every aspect of growth and development differently. Some areas might not be affected at all, whereas others could be greatly affected. Using your baby’s corrected age for growth is particularly important.</p>

<h2>Who to tell about your child’s corrected age</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to tell child care teachers, preschool teachers, health professionals and anyone who cares for or works with your child that she was born prematurely. They will also find it useful to know how many weeks early she was born.</p>

<p>If you are worried about learning or developmental problems after your child starts school, it will be helpful for school teachers to know that your child was born early.</p>

<p>There is not a set age when you should stop correcting a child’s age for prematurity. But most health professionals recommend correcting at least until your child is two years old.</p>

<h2>How corrected age affects your child’s play and interactions</h2>

<p>You might notice that other babies of the same chronological age can do more than your premature baby. But if you think in terms of corrected age, you might find that what your child can do is just right for his age.</p>

<p>Like all children, your premature child will learn a lot from having plenty of different things to play with, do and see – for example, being read to, going out to the park and playing with other children.</p>

<p>All these different and stimulating experiences help your child’s brain to develop.</p>

<h2>Corrected age and starting child care, preschool or school</h2>

<p>Your child might start preschool and school based on her chronological age, not her corrected age.</p>

<p>But a few months in age can make a difference to what a child can do and what he is expected to do, especially at preschool. Some parents of premature children decide to delay school for a year, if their child’s corrected age is just below school entry age. This can give your child extra time to catch up in growth and develop the social skills he needs for preschool and school.</p>

<p>If your child is assessed for any development delays, you can ask for the test results to be scored at both your child’s corrected and chronological ages.</p>

<h2>When to have immunisations</h2>

<p>Premature babies generally get the same immunisations at the same chronological age as full-term babies. Premature babies need the protection of immunisation because they are more likely to get certain infections.</p>

<p>If your baby was very premature, she might get her first immunisations while she is still in hospital. She might also need an extra dose of some vaccines when she is older.</p>

<p>It is best to speak to your child’s doctor or paediatrician about your child’s immunisation needs.</p>",5386,6,"43,44,45",59,60,"1661, 3551, 431",,1,0,,en,published
276,Premature baby development: 26-36 weeks,"A premature baby’s development happens in the same order as it would have happened in the womb.
How early babies are born might affect the speed of their growth and their behaviour over time.
When your baby reaches certain health, growth and development goals, you will be able to take him home.","<h2>Premature baby development: the basics</h2>

<p>A premature baby’s development typically follows the same sequence as it would in the womb.</p>

<p>Your premature baby’s genes are programmed to make development happen in a particular way, and this keeps going even if your baby is born early. But your premature baby might have some health problems along the way. Sometimes babies also have delays in growth and development, especially if they’ve been ill.</p>

<p>All babies are different, and their behaviour and development are different too. With premature babies, the <strong>differences also have a bit to do with when they were born</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, a premature baby born at 32 weeks is likely to act differently from a baby born at 26 weeks, who has had many medical challenges by the time she gets to 32 weeks. The baby born at 26 weeks might take extra time to put on weight, learn to feed and come out into the social world.</p>

<p>Here are the changes you can expect and watch in your premature baby during his time in hospital.</p>

<h2>26 weeks</h2>

<p>At 26 weeks, a baby in the womb is about <strong>35 cm long and weighs about 760 gm</strong>. But premature babies are often small for their age. A baby born at 26 weeks would probably fit snugly into her father’s hand.</p>

<p>At this age your premature baby’s main job is to grow, sleep and become medically stable.</p>

<p>Your baby might open his <strong>eyes</strong> occasionally, but he can’t focus. Light or other visual stimuli might stress his body’s systems. Your baby’s nurse will normally cover your baby’s incubator, and some neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) dim the lights at night.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>movements</strong> are often jerks, twitches or startles. She doesn’t yet have good muscle tone and cannot curl up. Hospital staff will put your baby in a curled-up position, support her body with bedding and keep her warm. This helps her to keep up her energy.</p>

<p>Your baby might also have apnoea. This is common for very premature babies. The breath triggering part of your baby’s brain has not fully developed yet, so pauses between breaths are common. Your baby will grow out of it.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>ears and hearing structures</strong> are already fully formed, but he might be sensitive to external sounds. Your baby might notice your voice but he cannot respond to you yet.</p>

<p>Your baby will not be able to feed at the breast yet.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>skin</strong> is fragile and sensitive, and she might get stressed if she is handled or touched. The nurses will probably encourage you to hold your baby, but not stroke her.</p>

<h2>26-28 weeks</h2>

<p>At 26-28 weeks, babies in the womb continue to put on weight and grow longer. But if your premature baby is sick, his <strong>weight gain </strong>might not keep up with a baby in the womb. Also, hospitals use careful, staged feeding plans to protect your baby’s immature gut from infection, and this might slow weight gain.</p>

<p>At this age, babies start blinking. They also grow eyelashes and eyebrows.</p>

<p>Your premature baby still has low muscle tone and is likely to have twitches and tremors.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>sleep and wake cycles are not clear yet</strong>, but she might have active and quiet periods and very brief alert times. Your baby might open her <strong>eyes</strong>, but she probably still cannot focus or get her eyes moving together.</p>

<p>At this age, your baby’s <strong>responses to sound </strong>might change from hour to hour or day to day. Or he might respond to your voice but get stressed by other noises. His responses will start to give you some clues to what he likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>Your baby might begin <strong>sucking</strong>, but she still cannot feed from the breast. To breastfeed, she needs to know how to suck, swallow and breathe in the right order.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>skin </strong>is still fragile and sensitive. But if your baby is medically stable, you might be able to start skin-to-skin contact by doing kangaroo care.</p>

<h2>28-30 weeks</h2>

<p>In the womb a baby keeps getting heavier and longer, starts to move more often, knows the difference between some sounds – for example, voices and music – starts to grasp with his hands, and opens and shuts his eyes.</p>

<p>At this age, your premature baby will still be well supported with bedding and positioning, but she might <strong>move and stretch more actively </strong>as her muscle tone gets better.</p>

<p>Your baby’s quiet deep <strong>sleep</strong> (when he doesn’t move) and light sleep (when he moves limbs and eyes) increase at about 30 weeks. You will also start to see short alert and eye-opening periods, but this can be affected by your baby’s health, the environment or the time of day.</p>

<p>Your baby is starting to close her eyelids tightly if it is bright, but she still cannot move her <strong>eyes</strong> together very much. Her eyes would not normally get much stimulation at this age, so it might help to limit what she sees.</p>

<p>Your baby keeps <strong>responding to pleasant sounds </strong>and is still sensitive to other sounds. He might be quiet and attentive to your voice and might even seem to ‘wake up’ when you come in. You can start to talk or sing to your baby during his short alert times. But keep stimulation to one thing at a time – for example, eye contact or talking, but not both at once.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>rooting reflex</strong> – turning to a touch on the cheek – might start around this time. This means she is getting ready for breastfeeding. She might even start sucking, but she cannot feed at the breast yet.</p>

<p>Your baby might still be <strong>sensitive to touch</strong>, but he likes steady, gentle, hands-on touch or skin-to-skin contact. You might be able to get involved in caring for your baby about now.</p>

<h2>30-33 weeks</h2>

<p>At this age, a baby’s organs are all maturing. A baby born now might not need much medical help.</p>

<p>Your premature baby’s <strong>movement</strong> is smoother and more controlled, and she will start to bend her arms and legs for herself.</p>

<p>Your baby’s deep sleep increases. His <strong>alert periods </strong>come more often, especially if the room is dim – he shuts his eyes tightly if it is bright. When he is alert, your baby might focus on your face or another interesting object, and he might show an obvious response to your voice.</p>

<p>Your baby might like eye contact, cuddling or talking during these times – but it is still a good idea to keep it to one thing at a time. And you can also watch your baby’s body language for signs of stress.</p>

<p>Your baby might start to <strong>suck rhythmically </strong>and might show that she is ready to suck to feed. Letting your baby smell and taste breastmilk gets her senses ready for breastfeeding. Gently rubbing around her lips and inside her mouth before feeds helps her get ready for the touch sensations of feeding from the breast.</p>

<p>If you see your baby putting his hand to his mouth, this means that he is starting to soothe himself.</p>

<p>Your baby might still be very sensitive to touch and handling. It is helpful to tell her what you are about to do – for example, ‘We’re going to change your nappy now’. She can start associating your voice with what you are doing.</p>

<h2>33-36 weeks</h2>

<p>Your baby is now approaching the date he was due to be born. But even when he has reached 37 weeks, he is not necessarily like a full-term baby.</p>

<p>Your baby can now <strong>move more smoothly </strong>and bend her arms and legs. She can also move her head from side to side, and her muscle tone is stronger.</p>

<p>Your baby will be much less likely to experience apnoea.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>states are clear </strong>– quiet sleep, active sleep, drowsy, quiet and alert, awake and fussy, or crying. His alert states are still quite short, but they are getting longer and happening more often. He can have longer social times, and he can now turn away or close his eyes when he has had enough.</p>

<p>Your baby is more likely to respond to sounds and noises in the same way from day to day. You might even know how she is going to react when you say something to her.</p>

<p>Your baby probably <strong>still does not cry much</strong>. But as he gets closer to full-term age, he will cry more often to let you know what he wants.</p>

<p>Your baby can usually start breastfeeding around this time.</p>

<p>Your baby might still be sensitive to <strong>touch and handling</strong>, although telling your baby what you are about to do will help her relax over time.</p>

<h2>37 weeks and beyond</h2>

<p>Your baby might be ready to go home before his expected birth date. But it might take longer if your baby has had surgery or an illness.</p>

<p>The hospital will have health, growth and development goals for your baby to meet before you can take her home. These might include steadily gaining weight, feeding from the breast at all feeds, and having no problems with apnoea.</p>",1651,6,"43,44,45",59,60,"1661, 441, 3551, 1046",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/development/premature-baby-26-36-weeks"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/development/premature-baby-26-36-weeks</a></p>",en,published
281,Premature baby development concerns,"Most premature babies have typical development.
The earlier that premature babies are born, the more likely it is that they will have development problems.
Some premature children have thinking and learning difficulties, or problems with physical, social or emotional development. If you’re worried about your child’s development, speak to your child and family health nurse, GP or paediatrician.","<h2>Premature babies and the risk of development problems</h2>

<p>Most premature babies go on to develop like their full-term peers. But the earlier that premature babies are born, the more likely it is that they will have development problems.</p>

<p><strong>Late preterm babies</strong><br />
Late preterm babies are born just a little bit early – at 34-36 weeks. Most premature babies are late preterm.</p>

<p>Many of these babies’ organs are fully developed, but there are still lots of changes happening in their brains.</p>

<p>These babies have <strong>a very small risk of development problems and breathing difficulties</strong> compared to full-term babies. They might need to stay in hospital to put on weight and learn to feed by coordinating their sucking, breathing and swallowing.</p>

<p><strong>Extremely premature babies</strong><br />
Premature babies born at less than 28 weeks and babies born with extremely low birth weight of less than 1 kg have the highest risk of development problems. This risk increases if they also have medical complications during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have any concerns about your baby’s development, trust your instinct and speak early to your doctor. Your child might sometimes need to see other professionals too, like audiologists, optometrists, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and dentists.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Language development in premature babies</h2>

<p>Most premature babies <strong>develop normal language</strong>, but their language development might be delayed. They might have more trouble speaking and understanding what is said to them, compared to full-term children.</p>

<p>Language problems can also sometimes be an early sign of hearing, thinking or learning problems.</p>

<h2>Physical development in premature babies</h2>

<p>The majority of premature babies have typical physical and motor development, although premature children tend to be shorter and lighter than full-term peers.</p>

<p><strong>Motor problems</strong><br />
About <strong>40% of very premature children</strong> have mild motor impairments. These include problems with:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>fine motor skills – for example, holding a pencil</li>
	<li>motor planning – for example, working out how to walk around obstacles</li>
	<li>visuomotor coordination – for example, copying shapes</li>
	<li>sensorimotor skills – for example, picking up a full glass without spilling the contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some preterm babies have cerebral palsy. The risk of cerebral palsy is higher for very premature babies and for babies who are very sick in the NICU.</p>

<p><strong>Teeth</strong><br />
Premature babies are more likely to have dental problems than full-term babies.</p>

<p>Dental problems can include the following:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Abnormal tooth enamel</strong>: the tooth might look grey or brownish, or have an uneven surface. Cavities can form more easily in teeth with poor enamel. Brushing teeth regularly helps.</li>
	<li><strong>Late teeth</strong>: premature babies’ teeth often come a few months later than full-term children’s teeth, but they will still come in the usual order.</li>
	<li><strong>A high arch or groove</strong> <strong>in the roof of the mouth</strong>: this can affect speech and bite. Most children adapt to the shape of the roof of their mouth, but others might need braces later.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a good idea to <strong>visit a paediatric dentist</strong>, ideally before your child is one year old.</p>

<h2>Sensory development in premature babies: hearing, vision, sensory awareness</h2>

<p>The majority of premature babies have <strong>typical hearing, vision and sensory awareness</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Hearing</strong><br />
Premature babies are more likely than full-term babies to be deaf or hard of hearing, but very few children have severe problems in both ears that need hearing aids or cochlear implants.</p>

<p>A screening test for hearing can be conducted while the baby is still in hospital. This test picks up most hearing problems, but some are diagnosed later on. It is important to diagnose and deal with deafness, because children need to hear properly to develop language, social and communication skills.</p>

<p><strong>Vision</strong><br />
Children who are born prematurely are more likely to have vision impairment than full-term peers. They are more likely to develop mild visual problems like short-sightedness or long-sightedness, squint, contrast sensitivity, or problems with depth perception.</p>

<p>Most severe eye problems are picked up very early. Very premature babies can have regular eye tests while they are in hospital, which can lead to early treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Sensory sensitivity</strong><br />
Some parents say that their preterm children have sensory sensitivities, like heightened sensitivity to stimuli like noise or certain fabrics. Some premature babies do not like having things put in their mouths and can have trouble feeding. And premature babies might have a lower pain threshold than full-term babies.</p>

<h2>Thinking and learning development in premature babies</h2>

<p>The majority of premature babies have <strong>typical thinking and learning development</strong>, and do well at school.</p>

<p>A few premature children will have thinking and learning impairment. For example, they might have problems with reading, planning and staying on task.</p>

<p>You might not notice any problems until your preterm child goes to school. Premature children might need some extra support at school.</p>

<h2>Social and emotional development in premature babies</h2>

<p>The majority of premature babies have <strong>typical social and emotional development</strong>, but they can behave differently from full-term babies.</p>

<p>For example, in the first year of life, premature babies are less likely to interact with others compared to full-term babies. They are more likely to look away to avoid getting overwhelmed, and they might get irritable more quickly.</p>

<p>As your baby matures, these things will be less of a concern. And learning to read your premature baby’s body language can help you tell when your baby wants to engage and when he wants to stop.</p>

<p><strong>Social and emotional problems</strong><br />
If a child has ‘social and emotional problems’, it means the child is having trouble fitting in with her environment, following rules, and being social with other children and adults.</p>

<p>Most children sometimes have tantrums, get upset and push your boundaries. But children born prematurely are more likely to have difficulty coping with and managing their feelings. They can find it hard to stay calm, eat well and sleep well. Some might experience lower self-esteem or find friendships difficult.</p>

<p>Premature children are more likely than full-term children to have conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety and depression.</p>

<p>But <strong>these problems are</strong> <strong>still uncommon </strong>in children born prematurely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Loving, stable, stimulating and safe home and school environments, where your child can form close relationships, support his development. These kinds of environments can also help to make some development problems less severe and help children with early delay catch up by later childhood or the teenage years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Corrected age</h2>

<p>Knowing your baby’s corrected age can help if you have development concerns.</p>

<p>Corrected age is your baby’s <strong>chronological age minus the number of weeks or months she was born early</strong>. Your baby might seem to have delayed development if you compare her with a baby of the same chronological age. But if you use your baby’s corrected age, it might show that your baby’s development is tracking normally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twins, triplets and quadruplets are often born early. If you are worried about your twins, triplets or quadruplets, it might help to know that outcomes for multiple premature babies are similar to those for single premature babies.</p>

286,Your premature baby’s appearance,"Premature babies look different from full-term babies. Their appearance depends on how early they were born. Premature babies might need extra minerals and exercises to help bone and muscle development.
Premature babies have fragile skin and need to be handled carefully.","<h2>What your premature baby might look like</h2>

<p>Premature babies look different from full-term babies. Premature babies might also look different from each other, depending on how early they were born.</p>

<p>A baby born at 36-37 weeks will probably look like a small full-term baby.</p>

<p>But an extremely premature baby – for example, a baby born at 24 weeks – will be quite small and might fit snugly into your hand. This baby might have fragile, translucent skin, and his eyelids might still be fused shut.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NICU team carefully monitor your premature baby’s weight, length and head size to make sure he is growing as expected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Your premature baby’s bones</h2>

<p>A premature baby’s bones are not always fully developed.</p>

<p>In the last months of pregnancy, lots of minerals – including calcium and phosphorus – are transferred from mother to baby. In a full-term baby, this helps bones grow and get strong. But <strong>premature babies do not get these important minerals in the womb</strong>.</p>

<p>Premature babies also often lose more minerals through their urine than full-term babies.</p>

<p>And full-term babies spend their last few months in the womb stretching and flexing their muscles, which also helps their bones to develop. Premature babies miss out on this too.</p>

<p>It can take quite a while for your premature baby’s bones to grow and get strong.</p>

<h2>Helping your premature baby’s bones to grow</h2>

<p><strong>Gentle exercises </strong>specially designed for premature babies – for example, bending and straightening their arms and legs – can help your baby gain weight and build stronger bones and larger muscles. These exercises can also make it less likely that your baby’s motor development will be delayed.</p>

<p>These exercises need to fit into your premature baby’s overall medical plan, so <strong>speak to your doctor before you try them</strong>. Your baby’s doctor will know when your baby is ready to start exercises. A hospital physiotherapist will probably do these special exercises with your baby to start with, while you learn how to do them.</p>

<p>When you take your premature baby home, you can play games that encourage her to move her arms and legs. For example, let your baby kick while lying on the floor, or play ‘Row, row, row your boat’ while gently moving your baby’s arms.</p>

<h2>Your premature baby’s skin</h2>

<p>When a premature baby is born, his skin might not be fully developed. It develops quickly, though.</p>

<p>Skin has two very important functions. It lets your baby sense the world through touch and temperature. It also protects all the vulnerable tissues and organs inside your baby’s body.</p>

<p><strong>Sensation</strong><br />
Touch is the first of the senses to mature. Your premature baby learns about the world mainly through touch, and touch is a key way for you to bond with your premature baby.</p>

<p>It can be soothing for your premature baby if you warm your hands and place them gently on her back or head. Just keep them still. Too much pressure or the wrong kind of touch can be stressful for your baby. Your baby’s nurse will show you how to touch your baby to soothe and comfort her.</p>

<p><strong>Protection</strong><br />
In a full-term baby, the skin acts as a barrier against bacteria and viruses that can infect the body. The fat under the skin also insulates the baby by keeping in heat and fluid. It prevents dehydration too.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the skin of very small premature babies – those born at around 26 weeks – has not fully developed. It <strong>might look smooth and shiny or translucent</strong>, and it is very fragile. It does not yet act as an efficient barrier. So if anything gets on the baby’s skin, the hair follicles and glands might let it through – for example, any lotions or creams put onto the skin.</p>

<p>Later – at 30-32 weeks – your baby’s skin <strong>might look wrinkly and loose</strong>, because the skin surface has increased, but your baby doesn’t have much fat underneath the skin.</p>

<p>Because premature babies sometimes have very little fat, they cannot keep a steady body temperature. Your baby’s incubator will be warmed and might be humidified until his skin strengthens 2-3 weeks after birth.</p>

<p>It is also normal for premature babies’ skin to get dry and flaky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Skin is a live organ that forms new layers and sheds old ones all the time. It has sweat pores, glands, blood vessels and sensory nerves. It stores water, sugar and calcium, and it helps produce vitamin D.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Taking care of your premature baby’s skin</h2>

<p>Each NICU will have its own procedures for looking after premature babies’ fragile skin. For example, your NICU might use oil or cream for premature babies with very dry skin, and staff will take care handling premature babies with very fragile skin.</p>

<p>You can also help to care for your premature baby’s skin by:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>using soft cotton baby clothes rather than synthetics that do not breathe or wool that can be scratchy</li>
	<li>not putting anything onto your baby’s skin without first checking with the nurse or doctor</li>
	<li>learning how best to touch your baby – your baby’s nurse or doctor will be able to help you.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Without much body fat or muscle, premature babies tend not to move very much. Some of their first movements can be jerky. But as their muscles develop and their nerves start connecting to the brain, their movements become more smooth and controlled.</p>

291,Learning disabilities: spotting the signs and supporting your child,"Learning disabilities are problems with reading, spelling or maths. Although learning disabilities can be challenging for your child, your child can still learn and be successful.","<h1>What is a learning disability?</h1>

<p>A learning disability is a <strong>serious and ongoing difficulty with one or more of the following areas of learning</strong> – reading, spelling, writing and maths. A child with a learning disability will have a low level of ability in one or more of these areas when his educational opportunities, age and other abilities are taken into account.</p>

<p>Learning disabilities are sometimes called specific learning disabilities, learning difficulties, specific learning difficulties and dyslexia.</p>

<p>Learning disabilities must be assessed and diagnosed by professionals.</p>

<h2>Causes of learning disabilities</h2>

<p>We don’t yet fully understand the exact causes of learning disabilities. But we do know that when a child has a learning disability, parts of that child’s brain have <strong>difficulty handling information</strong> – this is called ‘neurologically based processing difficulties’.</p>

<p>Common ‘processing difficulties’ include difficulties working out the sounds in words, or trouble remembering unrelated pieces of information, like a new list of numbers or letters.</p>

<p>Learning disabilities have been associated with particular genes and can be inherited. If other people in your family have trouble with reading or spelling or have been diagnosed with learning disabilities, there’s a chance that children in the next generation might have learning disabilities.</p>

<h2>Signs of learning disabilities</h2>

<p>If you think your child might have a learning disability, you can look out for some common signs. Having one or more of these signs doesn’t mean your child definitely has a learning disability. But if you’re worried, it’s a good idea to talk to your child’s teacher or your family GP.</p>

<p>If your child has a learning disability, your child might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>dislike reading and/or find reading hard</li>
	<li>have lots of trouble spelling common words</li>
	<li>find it hard to spot the sounds and syllables in words</li>
	<li>tell you lots of interesting ideas but find writing them down slow and difficult</li>
	<li>have very messy handwriting</li>
	<li>not feel very confident about schoolwork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosing learning disabilities: steps to take</h2>

<p><strong>Talk with your child’s teacher</strong><br />
If you’re worried that your child is having trouble at school and might have a learning disability, you could start by talking with your child’s teacher.</p>

<p>You can ask questions about whether your child is progressing as expected with reading, writing and maths. It might also be worth talking about the teacher’s impression of your child’s self-esteem and engagement at school.</p>

<p>The teacher can test your child and go through the results with you. This can help you see whether there’s a pattern of problems.</p>

<p><strong>Ask for an assessment</strong><br />
If you’re still concerned, ask for a formal assessment through your school.</p>

<p>A speech therapist or a psychologist<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/psychologist""> </a>could be involved at this point. They’ll help to check all the possible causes. If there’s a long wait, or the assessment isn’t available through your school, you can arrange to see a specialist privately, but there will be a cost to you.</p>

<p>It’s important to see your GP to check your child’s sight and hearing. This way you can rule out problems in these areas as the cause of your child’s difficulties.</p>

<h2>Telling your child about a learning disability</h2>

<p>Children who have learning disabilities can’t do things like reading as easily as their peers can. This can lead to them thinking of themselves as ‘dumb’ or ‘stupid’.</p>

<p>Telling your child that she has a learning disability can help her overcome this way of thinking. You can tell your child that having a learning disability means her brain thinks about information differently, but it <strong>doesn’t mean she’s not as smart as other children</strong>.</p>

<p>Your child’s psychologist or speech therapist can give you advice and help you explain the disability to your child in a way that he can understand.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>highlight the positive things your child can do</strong> to live and learn with the learning disability. You might mention that lots of really successful people have learning disabilities.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Helping your child with a learning disability build resilience and self-esteem</strong></p>

<p>Children with learning disabilities can suffer from low self-esteem. They’re also at a higher risk of dropping out of school if the disability isn’t picked up early.</p>

<p>This means it’s important to identify learning disabilities early, and help your child build resilience. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from problems and setbacks. It’s an important life skill for all children, especially those with learning disabilities.</p>

<p>To <strong>help your child be resilient and positive about her ability and disability</strong>, you could try the following suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Be a role model</strong><br />
You can be a role model for your child by being positive, assertive and resilient yourself. For example, if you’ve baked a cake that doesn’t taste good, you can say, ‘It doesn’t matter. I’ll try another recipe next time’. Or if you get some negative feedback at work, you can say, ‘That’s hard to hear, but I can also learn from it’.</p>

<p><strong>Praise and encouragement</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Always praise your child for having a go at something.</li>
	<li>Celebrate your child’s abilities and achievements by pointing out the non-academic things your child is good at. It might be sport, music, drama, or being kind and friendly or an excellent cook.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to notice the positive things in her life and see that her learning difficulties are only one small part of who she is.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to work out what he needs to get over difficulties – for example, do written instructions and diagrams help him, or does he prefer spoken instructions?</li>
	<li>Make time to be with and listen to your child and to have fun together. This sends the message that she’s special, important and worth spending time with.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to try new things. Realising that he can learn with practice and persistence will help your child keep going when things are hard.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Responsibilities and expectations</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child the chance to take on family responsibilities and make her own decisions and choices. A sense of control is a powerful self-esteem builder.</li>
	<li>Support but don’t overprotect your child. You can do this by expecting your child to do his best and stick with tasks like homework, despite his extra challenges.</li>
	<li>Give your child the opportunity to try new things like cooking, chess or photography. If you do these activities with your child, it’s a good way to make sure your child experiences success and has fun as she builds new skills.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Getting extra support for learning disabilities</strong></p>

<p>Extra support can give your child the best chance of doing well at school. If health professionals recommend extra support, you’ll need to have a professional, documented assessment to prove that your child is eligible for things like extra examination time, tuition from a reading expert, or special computer software.</p>

<p>There are lots of different types of <strong>support outside school</strong> available for children with learning disabilities, including specialist tutors. The best sort of support for your child will depend on your child’s learning disability. You can talk to your child’s teacher or other professionals working with your child to find out what will work best for your child and your family.</p>

<p>You might need to <strong>try a few different things</strong> before you work out what’s right for your child and family. This also shows your child how to be persistent and not give up.</p>

<p>To begin, try to work out what is making the situation difficult. Is it too many demands, time pressures or boredom? Or does the environment lead to difficult behaviour from your child – for example, in a shop is your child tempted by sweets that are kept at his eye level?</p>

<p>It is also worth thinking about whether you can avoid the situation or ask someone to help. For example, you might stay home with your child while your partner goes grocery shopping.</p>

<p>If you cannot avoid the situation, or you think it might help if your child learns how to cope better in the situation, planning ahead might help. The steps below take you through some ideas for planning ahead.</p>

<p>You might find it helpful to read more about how you can encourage good behaviour by changing your child’s environment.</p>

<h2>2. Make expectations clear</h2>

<p>Talk with your child before you go into a challenging situation. It helps if you are clear about what you expect from the situation and what behaviour is acceptable.</p>

<p>With toddlers and preschoolers, you can say what you expect. School-age children will have their own ideas, so work together to develop a few specific rules. With school-age children, this step is more of a negotiation, but you still have the final say.</p>

<p>Rules should be clear, simple and focused on the behaviour you want to see. For example, rules for a doctor’s waiting room might be, ‘Talk quietly’, ‘Ask before you touch’, ‘Be gentle with the toys and magazines’, and ‘Play on the floor next to me’. Your child will be more likely to remember the rules if there are not too many of them.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to agree in advance on what happens when the rules are followed and when they are broken. For example, for the doctor’s waiting room you might say, ‘If you stay close to me and ask before you touch, you can play with the toys or read the books. If you forget to stay close or touch without asking, you will sit on the chair next to me for one minute’.</p>

<p>Check that your child understands by asking him to explain the rules and the consequences to you. Do this again just before you enter the challenging situation – for example, just before you go through the door of the doctor’s clinic.</p>

<p>Family rules can help your family members get along better and make family life more peaceful.</p>

<h2>3. Think of your child as a ‘learner’</h2>

<p>Difficult behaviour can happen because a child does not have the skills to cope with a situation. Ask yourself how you can help your child learn what to do in challenging situations. Here are some suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Give your child chances to practise and succeed</strong><br />
When your chid is learning a new way to behave, it will help if she can practise the behaviour and succeed in easier situations. Once she is coping better, she can try harder situations. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shopping: plan a few short shopping trips for just a few items.</li>
	<li>Visiting/visitors: arrange a series of short visits from/to a friend or relative.</li>
	<li>Phone calls: arrange a series of short telephone calls.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Think about when your child is likely to be at his best</strong><br />
If you can, plan challenging situations around your child’s routine. For example, try to make appointments for directly after your child’s nap or snack.</p>

<p><strong>Work out what skills your child needs to learn</strong><br />
For example, if problems happen during phone calls, your child might need to learn how to say ‘excuse me’, how to wait for you to respond, how to accept your answer, and how to keep busy and quiet. These are things you could talk about. You could also show your child how to do these things, and praise him when he does them.</p>

<h2>4. Plan ways of helping your child keep busy and engaged</h2>

<p>For <strong>toddlers</strong>, plan some activities that will keep them busy in challenging situations. Have a ‘going-out bag’ ready, with a drink, a snack and a few small but interesting items – for example, paper and coloured pencils, stickers or blocks.</p>

<p>With your help, <strong>preschoolers and school-age children</strong> can plan interesting activities themselves, or you can get them involved in what you are doing. For example, while grocery shopping you might ask your child to find things on the shelves and put them in the trolley, or to identify colours or words on labels. When queuing at the post office, you could play a quiet game of ‘I spy’ or ‘Who am I?’</p>

<p>You can have special activities just for car trips or telephone calls. These could be audiobooks, music, sticker books and so on.</p>

<h2>5. Encourage good behaviour</h2>

<p>During a challenging situation, look for and encourage behaviour you like. Take the time to stop what you are doing every now and then to let your child know when you like what she is doing.</p>

<p>It can be hard to remember to do this, but praise makes it more likely that your child will repeat the behaviour. Try to praise more than you criticise. As a guide, try to praise your child six times for every one time you say something negative.</p>

<p>For example, during a shopping trip, you might praise your child for staying close, speaking in a quiet voice, and helping you find things. If the challenging situation is a telephone call, you might briefly stop talking to praise your child for playing quietly.</p>

<h2>6. Use consequences for behaviour you don’t like</h2>

<p>If you put the steps above into action, your child will be more likely to behave well. But it is best to plan consequences that you will use if your child misbehaves.</p>

<p>The good news is that most consequences that you would use at home you can also use somewhere else with some changes. For example, if you are using time-out at home, you can also use it on shopping trips by getting your child to sit or stand beside you for a short time at the supermarket.</p>

<h2>7. Have a follow-up talk</h2>

<p>It can help to have a talk with your child after you have been in a challenging situation. During the talk, highlight things your child did well, and celebrate the progress you are making together.</p>

<p>You might also point out one or two things your child might do differently in future. These can become your goals for next time.</p>",971,6,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"5136, 5141, 1051",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/planning-ahead"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/planning-ahead</a></p>",en,published
321,‘Beat the buzzer’: morning routine game,Getting your children ready for school or to leave the house can be a challenge. ‘Beat the buzzer’ is a fun morning routine game that encourages them to cooperate.,"<h2>About ‘Beat the buzzer’</h2>

<p>‘Beat the buzzer’ works because it rewards your child for being on time and ready in the morning.</p>

<p>As you introduce this game into your morning routine and play it with your child, praising your child will help things along. When children get praise for behaving well or doing what you want them to do, they are likely to want to keep behaving that way.</p>

<h2>How to make ‘Beat the buzzer’ part of your morning routine</h2>

<p><strong>1. Explain the game</strong><br />
Explain that you want to introduce a game called ‘Beat the buzzer’ to help with getting ready in the mornings. Choose a buzzer and show it to your child. You could use the alarm on a clock or your phone.</p>

<p><strong>2. Plan your morning routine together</strong><br />
Talk to your child about how you would both like the morning routine to improve. Agree on a ‘ready time’ – your child must be ready for school at this time.</p>

<p>Together, write a list of the tasks your child needs to do in the morning. With younger children, you do the writing, but you could ask them to help you draw a picture for each task on the list. Explain what tasks you expect children to do on their own and what tasks you will help with.</p>

<p>The list might look something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Eat breakfast.</li>
	<li>Get dressed.</li>
	<li>Brush teeth, wash face, and brush hair.</li>
	<li>Pack schoolbag.</li>
	<li>Put on jacket, hat, shoes.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you have a list that you are both happy with, put it up where your child can check it throughout the morning.</p>

<p><strong>3. Decide on rewards and consequences</strong><br />
Explain to your child what will happen if he is ready on time, and what will happen if he is not.</p>

<p>Make up a simple chart to keep track of success with ticks or stickers. You can decide how many ticks or stickers your child needs for a reward. At first, it might be that one tick or sticker equals a reward.</p>

<p>Choose some special rewards for beating the buzzer. Activities with mum or dad are often the most effective rewards.</p>

<p>Choose some appropriate consequences for not being ready. These could include not being allowed to watch TV, or going to bed 10-15 minutes earlier.</p>

<p><strong>4. Try out the game</strong><br />
On your first ‘Beat the buzzer’ morning, set the timer and leave your child to it. Let her know that you have set the ‘buzzer’ and now it is up to her.</p>

<p>Watch for your child being independent and responsible. Praise and encourage him – for example, ‘You’re going well’ or ‘Keep it up’. But avoid giving reminders and instructions about tasks – this will just lead you back to nagging and fighting.</p>

<p>If your child gets all the tasks done by the time the buzzer sounds, she wins – and gets the tick or sticker on her chart.</p>

<h2>If your child is not ready when the buzzer goes</h2>

<p>Here is what to do if your child is not ready when his time is up:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Calmly let your child know that the buzzer has sounded, and get her ready to go.</li>
	<li>Remind your child that he can try again the following morning.</li>
	<li>Follow through with the consequence you decided on.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Encourage your child to check the list rather than telling her what to do next. This will help her become more independent. It also reduces nagging from you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>‘Beat the buzzer’ next steps</h2>

<p>When things have been going well for a week or two, <strong>start phasing out the rewards</strong> over the next 3-4 weeks. Your child might need to be on time two, three, four, then five days in a row to earn the reward (make the reward a little bigger each time). Then make rewards a surprise. Your child will not know when a reward is on offer – it just happens every now and then.</p>

<p>As time goes on, your child might find it easy to beat the buzzer. Even when your child is regularly ready on time, praise him occasionally to keep him motivated.</p>",1701,6,"52,57,58",59,60,"5131, 101, 1821, 4571",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/-beat-the-buzzer-"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/-beat-the-buzzer-</a></p>",en,published

You might see a genetic counsellor if a genetic condition runs in your family. If you have a genetic condition in your family, genetic counseling might help to understand how the condition might affect your life, and how you might be able to prevent other family members getting the condition.","<h1>About genetic counsellors</h1>

<p>Genetic counsellors are health professionals qualified in genetics and genetic counselling. They work as part of teams, often with clinical geneticists.</p>

<p>If you have a genetic condition in your family, genetic counsellors can help you learn about:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>how the condition might change over time</li>
	<li>how the condition might affect your life</li>

331,Positive attention and your child,Positive attention is when you respond to your child with warmth and interest. It helps your child feel secure and valued. Find out how to make the most of daily moments to show positive attention to your child.,"<h2>What is positive attention?</h2>

<p>Positive attention is the way you show delight in your child and warmth in your relationship through:</p>

<ul>
	<li>smiling at your child</li>
	<li>making eye contact and using caring facial expressions</li>
	<li>being physically gentle and caring with your child</li>
	<li>using words to celebrate and encourage your child</li>
	<li>showing interest in your child’s interests, activities and achievements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why positive attention is important</h2>

<p>From birth, children need experiences and relationships that show them they’re valued, capable human beings who bring pleasure to others. Positive attention, reactions and responses from key grown-ups help children build a picture of how valued they are.</p>

<p>Your <strong>child’s self-image</strong> builds up over time with positive, loving messages from you and other important people in his life.</p>

<p><strong>Your child’s feelings of security and safety</strong> come from her interactions with you and the other people who care for her. If you reassure and support your child when she’s frightened, uncertain or faced with a new or unfamiliar situation, she’ll feel safe and secure.</p>

<h2>How to show positive attention: all ages</h2>

<p><strong>No matter what your child’s age</strong>, there are simple things you can do every day to send the message that your child is special and important. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Look at your child and smile at her.</li>
	<li>Show interest in what your child is doing – ask him to tell you about it if he can.</li>
	<li>Pay attention and listen closely when your child talks to you.</li>
	<li>Make up some special rituals you can share together.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also ways you can show positive attention to children of different ages.</p>

<h2>Newborns and babies: positive attention tips</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Comfort your baby when she cries.</li>
	<li>Smile back when your baby smiles.</li>
	<li>Respond to the sounds your baby makes by saying something in return.</li>
	<li>Chat about what’s going on around the two of you.</li>
	<li>Notice what your baby is interested in and encourage him to explore – for example, show him how to shake a colourful rattle that has caught his eye.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Toddlers: positive attention tips</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Tell your child exactly what you like about what he’s doing. For example, ‘I love it when you help to pick up the blocks’. Use a positive tone of voice to match the praise.</li>
	<li>Get into the moment with your child. This could be as simple as squatting down to look at a caterpillar together.</li>
	<li>When you’re talking together, leave time after you talk so your child can reply, even if she can’t always find the right words.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preschoolers: positive attention tips</h2>

<p>Make time to do your child’s favourite activities with her – for example, jigsaws, Lego, painting and so on.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give lots of feedback about the kinds of behaviour that you want to encourage – for example, ‘Thanks for bringing your plate to the kitchen. That makes it much quicker to tidy up after lunch’.</li>
	<li>Remember to smile and make eye contact with your child when you greet him in the morning – perhaps even take a moment for a special cuddle.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it’s hard to be positive</p>

<p>It’s not realistic or even normal to be positive all the time. And your child will cope just fine if you’re occasionally unavailable, anxious, or distracted.  Home stresses, as well as the pandemic, economic uncertainty, and other events create difficult times for you and your child.  Remember to take care of yourself.</p>

<p><strong>It’s what happens over time, not each particular incident, that makes the difference.</strong> If your child gets mostly positive attention from you over time, he’ll feel loved and secure.</p>

<p>However, when parents are consistently unable to focus on their children’s needs, children can be negatively affected in the early years and into the future. If many of your daily interactions with your child are negative, or if it’s hard for you to feel or act positively with your child, it’s worth seeking help from your health provider or other professional. help.</p>",4676,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"4761, 4766, 4771",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/connecting-communicating/connecting/positive-attention"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/connecting-communicating/connecting/positive-attention</a></p>",en,published
336,Talking with babies and toddlers: how to do it and why,"Key points

Talking with babies from birth builds language and communication skills.
You can talk with your child anywhere, anytime, about anything!
Help your child learn about conversation by pausing and giving your child time to respond.
Reading, singing songs and using rhyme are good for children’s language.","<h2>Talking with babies and toddlers: why more talk is better</h2>

<p>Talking with your baby or toddler can help his language and communication development. The more you talk with your baby or toddler, the better.</p>

<p>This is because parents who talk a lot to their young children use lots of different sounds and words. When children hear more words and lots of different words, it improves their understanding of language. It also increases the number and variety of words that they understand and use.</p>

<p>And it’s not just about better language skills. Talking with babies helps their brains develop and can help children do better at school when they’re older.</p>

<h2>What kind of talking is good for babies and toddlers?</h2>

<p>Talking with babies and toddlers doesn’t have to be a big deal. You can talk to your child about hanging out the washing, preparing meals or whatever is happening around you.</p>

<p>For example, you’re outside with your child and she points to a tree. You could say, ‘It’s a great big enormous tree, isn’t it? I wonder what kind of animals live in that tree? Maybe a possum?’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sing-song voice that many grown-ups use around babies is called ‘parentese’. It sounds a bit like this: ‘Helloooo babbeeee, who’s a widdle baaabeeee?’ Babies prefer this kind of talk to normal grown-up conversation. So go right ahead if you want to use parentese to talk to your baby.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>How much talking is good for babies and toddlers?</h2>

<p>Any and all talking is good for your baby or toddler, so try to talk as much as you can during the day. You don’t need to make a special time for talking.</p>

<p>Babies and toddlers like quiet times too, so if your child stops responding to you and starts to look tired, restless or grumpy, you might like to choose another time in the day to talk.</p>

<p>Your child’s temperament might also affect how often he wants to communicate with you. Some babies and toddlers are naturally more outgoing, and others are quieter.</p>

<h2>When to start talking with babies?</h2>

<p>It’s great to start talking with your baby as early as you can. In fact, from birth your baby absorbs a huge amount of information about words and talking, just from listening and watching you talk.</p>

<p>Conversations with your baby might feel one-sided to begin with. But even though your young baby doesn’t have words yet, she’ll be listening to you, and she’ll try to join the conversation! She’ll use crying, eye contact and listening to communicate. Later on, she’ll coo, smile, laugh, make more sounds and move her body to communicate with you.</p>

<p>If you pay attention to your child when you’re talking, you’ll notice this early baby talking and communication.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By communicating back and forth with your child in a warm and gentle way, you’re creating and sharing experiences together. This strengthens your relationship with your child and helps your child learn more about the world at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tips for talking with babies and toddlers</h2>

<p>You might feel silly having conversations with a baby or a toddler who’s not talking much, but keep at it! Conversations and activities that include some of the ideas below are good for developing your child’s language skills.</p>

<p><strong>Tune into your child</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce distractions. Turn off the TV or computer or do whatever helps you to just ‘be present’ to talk to your child.</li>
	<li>Notice what your child is interested in, ask a question or make a comment, and then give your child time to respond. For example, at bath time you could say, ‘Is that Ducky? Ducky’s swimming. Splash!’</li>
	<li>As your toddler learns to talk, give him time to find words for his ideas and really listen when he talks. For example, try not to finish his sentences for him, and make sure he’s finished before you talk. This sends the message that what your child has to say matters.</li>
	<li>Use natural pauses. Your child will eventually fill in these pauses when her language develops. This also teaches her ‘give and take’ in a conversation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Be interesting</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Talk to your child about things he’s interested in – for example, what grandpa might be doing today, a story you’ve read together, or something that’s happening outside.</li>
	<li>Talk about an experience you shared – for example, ‘It’s sunny today. But remember how wet we got on the way home yesterday? Your socks were soaked!’</li>
	<li>Use lots of expression to make your conversation interesting and engaging. What you talk about doesn’t matter as much as how you talk about it.</li>
	<li>If you use complex words, explain them and build on them by using lots of descriptive words. For example, ‘We’re going to see the paediatrician – that’s a special doctor who knows all about babies and children’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Read, tell stories, sing songs and make rhymes</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Read books and tell stories to your baby from birth, every day if you can. After a few weeks, your baby will know that this is when you enjoy a quiet, special time together.</li>
	<li>Talk about the pictures in books, wonder out loud what might happen next in the story, point out words and letters, and let your child touch and hold the book and turn the pages. You can make up your own stories to go with the pictures in the book.</li>
	<li>Help your child learn that books and reading are fun. You can do this by having a special reading spot, making cuddles part of reading time and letting your child choose some books – even if you have to read the same ones over and over again!</li>
	<li>Sing songs and rhymes in the car, in the bath, at bedtime – even if it’s off-key. Your baby will love the rhythm of the words and will be soothed by your voice. You can check out our Baby Karaoke for ideas.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Your child will also learn to talk by watching how you communicate with others. If you talk in a positive way, your child will learn to speak positively to others. For example, when you’re talking together at mealtimes, you can use positive language like ‘What was good about your day today?’</p>

341,Your premature baby’s body language,"Premature babies have different body language from full-term babies. Signs of stress in premature babies include fast breathing, twitching and skin colour changes. Signs of relaxation include stillness and slow breathing.","<h2>About premature baby body language</h2>

<p>Premature babies have different body language from full-term babies. This is because premature babies are less mature, smaller, more sensitive to touch and noise, and not as strong.</p>

<p>For example, a premature baby’s feelings might show in breathing rate, skin colour and body twitches. These things can often change quickly, but they give you clues to how premmies are feeling.</p>

<p>Also, the body language of a premature baby born at 24 weeks will be different from that of a baby born at 34 weeks. For example, very premature babies might not make eye contact for as long or as often as a near-term babies.</p>

<p>Your premature baby’s body language and responses will change as she gets bigger and stronger. You’ll get <strong>more obvious clues to how your baby is feeling</strong>. For example, premature babies don’t cry as much as full-term babies, but you’ll notice your baby crying more as she gets older. She’ll probably start wanting to make eye contact too.</p>

<p>As your baby gets bigger, you’ll see <strong>more definite ‘states’</strong> too. For example, a very young premature baby might open his eyes only occasionally. But an older premature baby will gradually have more and longer spells of being awake and alert. He might be deeply asleep, lightly asleep, drowsy, awake and alert, awake and fussy, or crying.</p>

<p>Always expect the unexpected – premmies might not respond in the same way from one day to the next. It might help to know that every day you’ll get to know your baby more and <strong>you’ll get better at reading your baby’s cues</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best time to interact with your premature baby is when she’s awake and alert. This is when your baby is most likely to be calm and relaxed. It’s easier to bond with your baby when she’s awake, alert and relaxed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Body language that shows your premature baby is feeling overwhelmed</h2>

<p>When premature babies are uncomfortable, overwhelmed or stressed, they can show this in their body language.</p>

<p>Your premature baby might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>wake up or stay awake and be upset</li>
	<li>change from being alert to being drowsy or fussy, or start crying once he’s bigger and stronger</li>
	<li>have a distressed look on his face or have a wrinkly forehead – sometimes called ‘brow bulge’</li>
	<li>make jittery or jerky movements of his arms and legs, cover his face with his hands, or splay or fist his fingers and toes</li>
	<li>breathe faster, or have a faster heart rate</li>
	<li>change skin colour to pale, red, mottled or blue</li>
	<li>yawn, sneeze, hiccup, gag or spit up.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you see these signs while you’re handling your baby, <strong>cover her, keep her still and do nothing for a moment</strong>. This should help her get back to balance.</p>

<p>If your baby is in an incubator, tell the nurse and see whether you can work together to change your baby’s environment so he’s more comfortable. For example, you might need to adjust the noise or light or your baby’s position.</p>

<p>Our article on helping your premature baby feel calm has more tips on easing your baby’s discomfort.</p>

<h2>Signs that your premature baby is relaxed</h2>

<p>You might be able to tell that your premature baby is relaxed and comfortable just by the fact that she <strong>isn’t showing any of the signs of being uncomfortable</strong>.</p>

<p>If your premature baby is feeling OK, you might also see that he:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>has regular, relaxed breathing</li>
	<li>has a relaxed body</li>
	<li>moves in a less jerky and more gentle way</li>
	<li>is still and alert and might even want to look at you or something else.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your baby might be very interested in looking at something (often a face), and her body will be quite still and her breathing slow. <strong>This is your premature baby’s way of showing that she’s interested.</strong></p>

<p>As your premature baby gets older, he’ll be able to stay awake and engage for short periods. This is the time to play with your premmie, by talking, cuddling, singing or making eye contact.

346,Fear of strangers: babies and young children,"Key points
Fear of strangers is normal and common. It can start at around eight months and usually passes by around two years.
You can help your child feel comfortable around strangers by being patient and introducing new people gradually.
For older children who are afraid of strangers, it can help to work on building independence.","<h2>Fear of strangers: the basics</h2>

<p>For babies and toddlers, fear of strangers is very common. It’s a <strong>normal stage</strong> in child development.</p>

<p>It happens as your baby develops a healthy attachment to familiar people – like you. Because babies prefer familiar adults, they might react to strangers by crying or fussing, going very quiet, looking fearful or hiding.</p>

<p>Fear of strangers<strong> usually becomes more intense at around 7-10 months of age</strong>. It can last a few months or continue for much longer. It usually passes somewhere between 18 months and 2 years.</p>

<p>For example, a 10-month-old baby who has been going to child care since she was 6 months old might get upset if there’s a new carer at the centre. She might cry, bury her head in her mother’s neck or scream when the carer tries to take her from her mum or dad.</p>

<h2>Helping with fear of strangers: what you can do</h2>

<p>Although fear of strangers is part of normal development for babies and toddlers, there are things you can do to help your child feel less upset.</p>

<p><strong>Helping your child feel comfortable around strangers</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Don’t ignore or laugh at your child’s fear of strangers. This could make the fear worse.</li>
	<li>Hold your child’s hand or let him sit on your lap when he meets new people.</li>
	<li>Introduce strangers first at home, if possible. Home is where your child feels most comfortable.</li>
	<li>If your child gets very upset with a new person, comfort her and try a different approach like all playing together. You could also move your child slightly away from the new person until she calms down. Then you can try again.</li>
	<li>Take your child’s comfort item (toy or blanket) with you when you’re spending time with new people.</li>
	<li>Stay calm yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Taking it slowly</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Be patient. Don’t push your child to go to new people before she’s ready.  ""It looks like you want to stay with me for a little while longer.  You can look at a book right here first.""</li>
	<li>When you introduce your child to someone new, stay with your child.</li>
	<li>Ask unfamiliar adults, like extended family or adult friends, to wait for a while before they pick up your child.</li>
	<li>For slightly older children, explain to your child who the new person is and what’s happening. For example, say ""This is my friend Ann.  She likes to play with trucks, too!  Ann will stay with you while we go to visit our friends.  We'll be back right after you have your bath.""</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meeting new people</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep introducing your child to new people. The more chances your child has to meet new people and discover that they’re safe, the more likely it is that her fear will reduce.</li>
	<li>Show your child that you’re not scared of new people. Greet them warmly with positive body language – smiles, relaxed posture, eye contact and a happy voice.</li>
	<li>Help older children practise some coping strategies for meeting new people – for example, ‘Let’s take some calm breaths together’ or ‘Here’s a big kiss that won’t wear out all day. Can I have one too?’ These simple strategies can help your child feel more confident around unfamiliar people.</li>
	<li>Don’t worry about grown-ups’ feelings. Just tell them that your child is still learning to be around strangers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fear of strangers in children over two years</h2>

<p>Most children’s fear of strangers starts to pass by about two years, but <strong>it isn’t unusual for older children to be afraid of strangers</strong> also.</p>

<p>One way to help with worries about unfamiliar people is to work on building your child’s independence. If your child feels more independent, he might also feel more confident around strangers.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>tips to help with independence</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Let your child do things for herself, like feeding herself, exploring new play environments and entertaining herself with toys.</li>
	<li>Give your child lots of new experiences and introduce him to new faces. With time, he’ll realise that nothing bad will happen.</li>
	<li>Try not to rush in to solve problems, and give your child a chance to work out solutions for herself.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to be responsible for some simple family chores – for example, putting things in the supermarket trolley, checking the letterbox or setting the table.</li>
	<li>Help your child learn to settle for sleep away from home. This will help if you need to leave your child at naptime or bedtime – for example, at child care or for a sleepover at a relative’s house.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting help for fear of strangers</h2>

<p>Most children under age two are a bit wary of being with new people.  If your child’s fear of strangers lasts into later years and is really intense, or is getting worse, you might talk with your health provider about your concerns and about different ways to help. </p>",1061,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51",59,60,,,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/common-concerns/fear-of-strangers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/common-concerns/fear-of-strangers</a></p>",en,published
356,Separation anxiety in babies and children,"Key points

Separation anxiety is a normal part of development from about eight months of age.
You can help your child with separation anxiety by gently encouraging him to separate from you. This might take practice and praise.
If your child’s separation anxiety is severe, long-lasting and interferes with your child’s life, consider seeking professional help.","<h2>What is separation anxiety in children?</h2>

<p>Separation anxiety is children’s frequent, normal worry about being away from their parents or other carers.</p>

<p><strong>Separation anxiety</strong> can start at around 8 months and reach its peak in babies aged 14-18 months. It usually goes away gradually throughout early childhood.</p>

<p><strong>Stranger anxiety</strong> is similar to separation anxiety. It’s when children get upset around people they don’t know. It can happen from 7-10 months and usually starts to go away after children’s first birthdays.</p>

<p>These worries are a <strong>normal part of development</strong> in the first few years. In fact, showing upset when separated tells you that your child really cares about you--as you do for her! </p>

<h2>Helping children  be more comfortable</h2>

<p>If your baby has started to be upset when separated from you, there are lots of things you can do to help her.</p>

<p><strong>In new places</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If you’re leaving your child in a new setting – child care centre, preschool, friend’s house, babysitter – spend time at the new place with your child before the separation.</li>
	<li>At least at first, let your child take something she loves from home, like a teddy bear, pillow or blanket.</li>
	<li>Tell your child’s child care centre, preschool or school if your child tends to be upset at separation and let them know what you’re doing to help your child.</li>
	<li>Gently encourage your child to separate from you by giving her practice. Don't avoid separations but try to give her positive experiences.  Daddy always comes back!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When you’re leaving your child</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Tell your child when you’re leaving and when you’ll be back. Sneaking out without saying goodbye can make things worse.</li>
	<li>Settle your child in an enjoyable activity before you leave.</li>
	<li>Say goodbye to your child briefly – don’t drag it out.</li>
	<li>Keep a relaxed and happy look on your face when you’re leaving.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At home</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>No matter how frustrated you feel, avoid criticising your child’s difficulty with separation. For example, avoid saying things like ‘She’s such a mummy’s girl’ or ‘Don’t be such a baby’.</li>
	<li>Read books or make up stories with your child about separation fears – for example, ‘Once upon a time, there was a little bunny who didn’t want to leave his mummy. He was afraid of what he might find outside his burrow …’ This might help your child feel he’s not alone in being afraid of separating from his parents.</li>
</ul>

366,"Biting, pinching and hair-pulling","Key points

Babies bite, pinch and pull hair to work out cause and effect. Toddlers often do it to express feelings they don’t have words for.
Respond to this behaviour by saying ‘No’, but stay calm. Give the behaviour as little attention as possible.
For toddlers, try to understand the reason for the behaviour. This can help you decide what to do next.","<h2>Biting, pinching and hair-pulling: why babies and toddlers do it</h2>

<p>Young children may bite, pinch and pull hair to experiment and explore their environment.</p>

<p><strong>Babies</strong> of 6-12 months may try behaviours like biting, pinching and pulling your hair just to explore what happens. </p>

<p>Babies may also bite when they’re teething because their gums feel sore.</p>

<p><strong>Toddlers</strong> might bite, pinch or pull hair because they’re excited, angry, upset or hurt and they don't have words to express these feelings.</p>

<p>Some toddlers might bite, pinch or pull hair because they’ve seen other children do it, or other children have done it to them. They might also do it when they’re fighting with another child.</p>

<h2>Babies: managing biting, pinching and hair-pulling</h2>

<p>It’s best to give your baby a clear verbal response when he bites, pinches or pulls hair. For example, you can say, <strong>‘No’</strong>.</p>

<p>The next step is to remove your child’s hand (or mouth!) and calmly turn away or put her down. If your baby hits, bites or pulls your hair again, respond in the same way.</p>

<p>If your baby is teething, give him something else to bite, like a teether, a cold washcloth or a safe toy. If he’s hungry, offer him a feed.</p>

<p>Babies will repeat behaviour that gets them a lot of attention. So as soon as your child shows a positive behaviour – for example, giving you a gentle touch – reward her with lots of attention.</p>

<h2>Toddlers: managing biting, pinching and hair-pulling</h2>

<p>A clear, verbal response to biting, pinching and hair-pulling is important. It’s also good to let toddlers know how you feel. For example, you can say, <strong>‘No. No biting. Biting hurts Mummy’</strong>.</p>

<p>Your next steps depend on the reasons for your child’s behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>No words for ‘big feelings’ </strong><br />
If you think your child is biting, pinching and hair-pulling because he can’t find words for his feelings it’s really important to stay calm. You can also help your child learn words for feelings. For example, you could say something like, ""No hitting me! Use your words.  You can say, 'Mama, I am very mad!'""</p>

<p><strong>Attention </strong><br />
Taking your attention away from your child sends her a very powerful message about how you’re feeling. For example, you can turn away or move away from her if she tries to bite you.</p>

<p><strong>Stimulation or hunger</strong><br />
If your toddler is biting because she may be hungry, you could offer crunchy food like crackers or vegetable sticks, a drink bottle with a straw, or a teether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your child keeps biting, pinching or hair-pulling, try to respond the same way each time it happens.This will help your child learn about appropriate behaviour. If your child is three or older, you could think about giving her a consequence like a short time-out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>If your toddler bites, pinches or pulls the hair of another child</h2>

<p>If your child bites or hurts another child, stay calm and get in quickly with an apology to the child and the other parent. You might also say ‘Your friend Sam is crying because pinching hurts’.</p>

<p>Next, calmly (if possible!) remove your child from the situation.</p>

<h2>Older toddlers: talking about biting, pinching or hair-pulling afterwards</h2>

<p>It can help to talk about biting, pinching and hair-pulling with older toddlers when you’re both calm. The key is to use language your child can understand.  ""You had a hard time playing with Mary today.  Mary was scared when you tried to bite her when she tried to take your toy.  You could say 'Mary, I need this now.  Can we share?'  Then Mary would want to play with you again!"" </p>

<p>After an upsetting incident of biting, pinching or hair-pulling, help your child feel calm again, getting involved with things like playing with sand or water, blowing bubbles, squishing playdough, or drawing quietly.</p>",1581,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/common-concerns/biting-pinching-hair-pulling"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/common-concerns/biting-pinching-hair-pulling</a></p>",en,published
371,Positive bedtime routines,"Key points

A positive bedtime routine can calm and soothe your child in the 20 minutes or so before bed.
A bedtime routine involves doing similar activities in a similar way each night. These activities can include having a bath, brushing teeth and reading.
If your child is settling to sleep later than you’d like, start the routine a bit earlier every few days, gradually moving towards your preferred time.","<h2>A positive bedtime routine: what is it and how can it help?</h2>

<p>A positive bedtime routine involves your child going through a few pleasurable activities about 20 minutes before bedtime.</p>

<p>A good bedtime routine helps soothe and calm your child so she’s ready for sleep. It also helps your child develop good sleep habits now and for the future.</p>

<p>Without a good bedtime routine, it can be hard for a baby to settle to sleep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you’re working on getting your baby or young child to settle better at bedtime, a positive bedtime routine will help. Child health professionals will almost always recommend a positive bedtime routine if you’re using behaviour strategies like controlled<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/sleep/solving-sleep-problems/controlled-comforting""> </a>comforting or camping<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/sleep/solving-sleep-problems/camping-out""> </a>out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What a positive bedtime routine looks like</h2>

<p>A bedtime routine can have quite a few activities. The key is that you do similar activities in roughly the same way each night, <strong>starting around 20 minutes before your child’s bedtime</strong>.</p>

<p>Most bedtime routines include pre-bed tasks like having a bath and brushing teeth, as well as quiet, enjoyable activities like reading a book or listening to a story. The aim is to <strong>keep the atmosphere calm and positive</strong>, using positive attention and praise.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a bedtime routine that could start after dinner and a bath:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your child plays quietly for 15-20 minutes – this could include reading with you.</li>
	<li>You and your child go into the bedroom.</li>
	<li>You and your child have a brief cuddle and kiss.</li>
	<li>You put your child into bed.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the 20-minute ‘positive period’, say goodnight to your child. This is the time to be firm if your child resists. Be clear that it’s now time for sleep, then leave the room straight away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Making a start: choosing a bedtime</h2>

<p>You might have an ideal bedtime in mind – somewhere between 7 pm and 8 pm often works for young children.</p>

<p>But when you’re dealing with settling problems, it’s best to start with the bedtime that’s <strong>closest to when your child naturally falls asleep</strong>. This increases the chance that the bedtime routine will become strongly linked to sleep time for your child. For example, if you find that your child finally falls asleep around 9 pm, start with this as a temporary bedtime.</p>

<h2>Moving your child’s actual bedtime towards your ideal bedtime</h2>

<p>About a week after you introduce the positive bedtime routine, you can start <strong>gradually making your child’s bedtime earlier</strong>.</p>

<p>This involves making bedtime about 15 minutes earlier every couple of days. You do this until you reach the ideal bedtime for your child.</p>

<p>For example, your child has been falling asleep at 9 pm, but <strong>you want an 8 pm bedtime</strong>. Here’s what to do:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start by putting your child to bed at 8.45 pm.</li>
	<li>Do this for two nights.</li>
	<li>Move bedtime back to 8.30 pm for the next two nights.</li>
	<li>Continue this gradual ‘fading’ process until your child is going to bed at the time you want.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>It can take a few weeks but a positive bedtime routine will improve settling problems, decrease the number of times your child calls out to you at night, and lead to better parent-child relationships.</p>

376,Language development: 3-12 months,"Between the ages of three months and one year, there is a lot happening with baby language development. You can expect your child to coo and laugh, play with sounds, babble and begin to communicate with gestures.","<h2>About baby language development</h2>

<p>Your baby’s communication skills grow dramatically in her first year of life. She will learn how to express herself, respond to you and understand when you communicate with her. All this happens before she says her first real words around her first birthday.</p>

<h2>Expressing: baby language development</h2>

<p>As part of his language development in the first year, your baby will express himself in many ways.</p>

<p>At <strong>3-4 months</strong>, he might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make eye contact with you</li>
	<li>say ‘ah goo’ or another combination of vowels and consonants.</li>
	<li>babble and combine vowels and consonants, like ‘ga ga ga ga’, ‘ba ba ba ba’, ‘ma ma ma ma’ and ‘da da da da’.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>5-7 months</strong>, she might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>copy some of the sounds and gestures you make, like coughing, laughing, clicking or making spit bubbles</li>
	<li>play with making different sounds, like ‘aaieee’, ‘booo’ and ‘ahh’ at varying (sometimes earsplitting!) pitches and volumes.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>8-9 months</strong>, he might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make longer sequences of sounds, which might sound like normal speech – this is sometimes called the ‘jargon phase’ and might continue when first words begin</li>
	<li>say ‘mama’ or ‘dada’, although he might not know what these mean yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>10-11 months</strong>, she might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>communicate with purpose, mainly to request, insist, refuse, reject or greet someone</li>
	<li>ask for something by pointing, or by looking at a person then at something she wants.</li>
</ul>

<p>By around <strong>12-14 months</strong>, your baby might say a few words and know what they mean, like ‘mama’ or ‘dada’ to refer to mum or dad.</p>

<h2>Responding: baby language development</h2>

<p>In these months, your baby will respond to you in many ways. For example, he might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make sounds, look excited or go quiet when you talk with him or say his name</li>
	<li>coo and laugh – for example, while you are changing his nappy</li>
	<li>smile and laugh when you play with him</li>
	<li>enjoy games like peekaboo and other action games</li>
	<li>use gestures like waving or pointing</li>
	<li>respond to his own name by looking, widening his eyes, listening or smiling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding: baby language development</h2>

<p>It is amazing how much your baby understands already – she is listening and learning all the time, as she makes sense of her world.</p>

<p>For example, in these months, you might find that your baby understands:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the word ‘no’ at around 10 months – although he still will not  always do as you say</li>
	<li>very simple instructions with verbal and visual cues – for example, at around 12 months, when you hold your hand out and say ‘ta’, he’ll give you the toy he is holding.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a new baby comes, children (especially toddlers) might feel you’re giving all your attention and love to the new baby. If you can be sensitive to these feelings, listen and show lots of affection, it shows your other children you’re still there for them. It also helps them feel secure.</p>

<p>Even though you’ll be busy with the new baby, try to <strong>spend some one-on-one time with your other children</strong>. </p>

<p>You can also look for times when they can enjoy extra attention from their other parent or a close family member, perhaps reading a story together or playing in the garden.</p>

<p>If you’re breastfeeding, your other children might be curious about breastfeeding and they might want to watch. They might also want be near you, or even climb into your lap while you breastfeed the baby.</p>

<p>T<strong>oddlers and even preschoolers might ask for a breastfeed</strong> at some point. How you respond depends on what's comfortable for you and in your culture.</p>

<p>Usually, children who are no longer breastfed will find the experience too strange to try more than once. If you’d prefer that your older child didn’t try breastfeeding, you can explain that breastmilk is made especially for babies, then offer a special drink or snack babies can’t have.</p>

<p>You can <strong>make breastfeeding a special time for all your children</strong>. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>While the baby is feeding, give your children a favourite toy, activity or task.</li>
	<li>If your other children are watching, you can explain that the milk helps the baby grow strong and healthy.</li>
	<li>If your other children want to be close, use this time to tell them a story, or watch while they draw you a picture.</li>
	<li>Try playing your other children’s favourite music or some recorded children’s stories, and listening with your other children while you’re breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenging behaviour after a new baby arrives: how to handle it</h2>

386,Dyslexia,"Children with dyslexia have serious difficulty with reading and spelling. Dyslexia is most often diagnosed in school-age children. Talk with your child’s teacher if you’re concerned about your child’s reading and spelling, especially if there’s a family history of learning difficulties. Support at school and home can help children with dyslexia improve their reading and spelling.","<h2>About dyslexia</h2>

<p>Dyslexia is a serious difficulty with reading and spelling words. Children with dyslexia have trouble reading and spelling even when they’ve had opportunities to learn and have tried very hard to learn.</p>

<p>Dyslexia is a type of learning disability – that is, a serious difficulty in a particular area of learning. It’s also sometimes called specific learning disorder.</p>

<p>Dyslexia is not a problem with intelligence. People with dyslexia are just as smart as other people, but their brains process language differently.</p>

<h2>Causes of dyslexia</h2>

<p>We don’t know what causes dyslexia. But we do know that dyslexia tends to run in families – it might be a condition that one or both parents pass on to their children through their genes. The genes that parents pass on seem to affect parts of the brain involved in speech and language.</p>

<h2>Signs of dyslexia</h2>

<p>Dyslexia symptoms are often picked up in the first two years of school, usually when children start learning to read.</p>

<p>Before children start school, it’s a bit harder to tell whether they have dyslexia. But there are some early warning signs in preschoolers. Preschoolers might have dyslexia if they:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>mispronounce more words than other children</li>
	<li>can’t play with sounds in words – for example, they have difficulty rhyming words like ‘cat’, ‘bat’ and ‘sat’, or saying words that start with the same sound like ‘some silly sandwiches’</li>
	<li>have more trouble than peers repeating long words and sentences</li>
	<li>are slow to connect letters and their sounds.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Once children start school</strong>, they might have dyslexia if they:</h3>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>have difficulty sounding out words  – for example, they can’t sound out the word ‘cat’ as the sounds c-a-t</li>
	<li>have difficulty putting sounds together to make words – for example, they can’t put together the sounds b-a-t to sound the word ‘bat’</li>
	<li>guess and memorise words instead of sounding out words when reading</li>
	<li>struggle to remember words even when they’ve read and/or written the words many times</li>
	<li>have more trouble reading and spelling than other children the same age.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your child has some of these difficulties, it doesn’t automatically mean that he has dyslexia.</h3>

<p>If you think your child might have a learning difficulty, it’s important to have it checked out early. Children often become quite good at covering up problems with learning as they get older.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing dyslexia</h2>

<p>If you have a family history of reading difficulties or if you’re concerned that your child is having trouble at school, especially with reading and spelling words, there are a couple of steps you can take towards getting a diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>1. Talk with your child’s teacher</strong><br />
The first step is talking with your child’s teacher. You can ask questions about how your child is going with reading and spelling. It might also be worth talking with the teacher about how your child is going at school more generally and how your child feels about school.</p>

<p>The teacher can go through your child’s school assessments with you. This can help you and the teacher see whether there’s a pattern of problems.</p>

<p><strong>2. Ask for an assessment</strong><br />
If you’re still concerned after talking with your child’s teacher, ask the school whether it can organise a formal assessment.</p>

<p>A speech pathologist and/or psychologist could be involved at this point. They’ll help to check the possible causes of your child’s difficulties with learning. If there’s a long delay with getting an assessment, or the assessment doesn’t seem to be available through your school, you can arrange to see a speech pathologist and/or psychologist privately.</p>

<p>Your doctor can help you with a referral to a speech pathologist or psychologist.</p>

<h2>Specialised support for children with dyslexia</h2>

<p>Getting support and starting intervention can help many children with dyslexia improve their reading and spelling skills.</p>

<p>Your child might benefit from support like:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>extra work in small groups at school</li>
	<li>one-on-one tutoring</li>
	<li>extra time to complete tests</li>
	<li>specialist computer software – for example, spell-checkers, screen readers, word prediction or voice recognition.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a good idea to speak with a health professional about the best options for your child.</p>

<p>The earlier that children with dyslexia get expert help, the better their chances of making good progress.</p>

<p>There is no ‘wonder cure’ for dyslexia. But there are many simple, supportive and productive ways to help children with learning disabilities. It’s a good idea to talk with a professional to get reliable advice about worthwhile options. For example, you could talk with your doctor, a paediatrician, your child’s teacher or a psychologist.</p>

<h2>Helping your child with dyslexia: things you can do</h2>

<p>There are lots of things you can do to support your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Help your child build resilience.</strong> For example, reward and praise your child’s effort and successes, whether it’s in the classroom or in other areas like sport, drama or music.</li>
	<li><strong>Help your child challenge negative thoughts and avoid setbacks.</strong> For example, ‘Don’t let what happened today get you down. Think about how much you’ve improved this year. You just might need a bit more time and practice to get this right’.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep in close touch with your child’s teacher</strong> to work out what you can do at home to support your child’s schoolwork and other successes.</li>
	<li><strong>Read to your child</strong> until your child has learned enough skills to read independently.</li>
	<li><strong>Offer books that suit your child’s reading ability. </strong>Choose books with spelling patterns that your child has learned and avoid books with too many hard words.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to teach your child to spell out sounds</strong> to make words instead of memorising the way that words look.</li>
</ul>

391,Pestering: what to do about it,"Key points

Reduce pestering by making sure your child knows what behaviour you expect, and praising him when he behaves well.
If your child pesters while you’re shopping, try to stay calm. Don’t change your mind if you’ve said no.
Try to minimise the advertising your child sees.","<h2>Why children pester</h2>

<p>To your child, the world is full of interesting things. In shopping centres, they’re often at your child’s eye level. Children are also easily influenced by clever marketing of children’s products – for example, toys and unhealthy food. And it can be hard for children to understand that some pretty, shiny or yummy things aren’t good for them or are a waste of money.</p>

<p>All of this can lead to pestering – ‘Can I have a lolly?’, ‘I want a toy!’, ‘Please, please, please!’</p>

<p><strong>Pestering can wear you down.</strong> It can even put you in embarrassing situations – for example, ‘Why can’t we buy that toy?’ It can be hard to say no when you know that giving in will bring your child instant pleasure – or bring you instant relief from repeated requests, whingeing or temper tantrums.</p>

<p>But <strong>if you give in, your child learns that pestering works</strong>. And this means he’ll keep pestering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asking for things isn’t always pestering. And the way you respond to children’s requests teaches them important lessons about how to influence, negotiate and communicate. Find out more in our article on how to respond when children ask for things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Reducing pestering</h2>

<p>You can take steps to make pestering less likely to happen in the first place:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Lay down some ground rules</strong> before you go shopping. Talk with your child about what behaviour you expect and how you’ll respond to any pestering.</li>
	<li>Praise your child for good shopping behaviour. Give her lots of positive attention so she knows you’ve noticed she’s not pestering. For example, ‘I’m really proud of how you helped me shop and didn’t ask for things we can’t get’.</li>
	<li>Offer <strong>healthy rewards</strong> for good shopping behaviour. For example, ‘If you can get through this shopping trip without asking for stuff, we’ll stop at the park on the way home’.</li>
	<li>Be aware of <strong>advertising in your home</strong> – for example, through the TV, radio, internet, junk mail, apps and social media. The more product advertising your child sees, the more he’ll want those products.</li>
	<li>Talk with your child about advertising and smart shopping. For example, you could talk about how free toys might make you want to buy some fast food products.</li>
	<li>Make decisions as a family about what you’ll buy. You can remind children of these decisions when you’re shopping. For example, ‘Remember we decided not to buy soft drink for a while? That way we’re all taking better care of our teeth’.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>One way to reduce online or in-app advertising is by choosing children’s games, apps and movies without advertising. Sometimes you might have to pay a little more for the ad-free version of an app but it can be worth it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Handling pestering</h2>

<p>If your child pesters or tries to get you to buy things by whining, demanding or threatening, you could try the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remind your child of the ground rules you discussed.</li>
	<li>Let your child know you won’t consider the request until she uses her manners. For example, you could say, ‘Dani, use your nice voice’ or ‘Think about how you’re asking that question’.</li>
	<li>Don’t say yes or no until you’re happy with the way you’ve been asked.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child sees that you’ve heard and understood. This way, your child will be more likely to accept your answer. For example, you could say, ‘Yes, they do look delicious’.</li>
	<li>When you say no, stick to it. Giving in to pestering can teach children to do it more. If you say no and then give in, your child gets the message that pestering and whining can work.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge your child’s disappointment if you’ve said no. For example, ‘I can see you really wanted those biscuits. But we’ve already had enough treats today’. Conversations like these send a message of empathy and can help you and your child move on.</li>
	<li>After saying no, try to distract your child with something else. For example, ‘We need oranges. Can you help me find them?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Staying calm when children pester</h2>

<p>Pestering can be frustrating and annoying. If you feel that pestering is getting the better of you, this exercise might help:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Stop.</li>
	<li>Count to 10.</li>
	<li>Now respond to your child.</li>
</ol>

<p>That extra 10 seconds is often enough to calm you down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pestering can be particularly stressful when it leads to a tantrum in a public place. Don’t be tempted to give in because there are strangers watching. Stay calm and forget your audience. It’s likely that most will be watching with empathy, and that they’ve probably been through it too!</p>

396,When children ask for things: how to respond constructively,"Key points

When your child asks for something, listen and think about it before you answer.
If you have to say no, try to negotiate first and always give a reason for refusing.
The way you respond to your child’s requests teaches your child about communication, respect and compromise.","<h2>Children’s requests: why it’s important to respond constructively</h2>

<p>Children ask for things all the time – for example, ‘Can I play on my iPad?’ or ‘Can I bake a cake?’</p>

<p>Some requests are easy to handle – for example, ‘Yes, it’s OK to play on your iPad’. Other requests are more difficult. For example, if your child wants to bake, you might think about safety in the kitchen or who’s responsible for cleaning up afterwards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When your child asks for something, it’s an opportunity to help him learn about communicating well and managing emotions – no matter what answer you plan to give.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Responding to requests</h2>

<p>The following steps can be useful when your child asks for things, regardless of whether you plan to say yes, no or maybe.</p>

<p><strong>1. Base your first response on how your child asks</strong><br />
If your child asks politely, praise your child for using good manners. This sends the message that you’ll always pay attention when your child uses good manners – even if you don’t always say yes.</p>

<p>If your child pesters, whines, demands or threatens, let your child know you need to hear some good manners. For example, you could say, ‘Sascha, please use your calm voice’ or ‘Can you ask me in a nicer way please?’</p>

<p><strong>2. Listen</strong><br />
Take a moment to understand what your child is asking for. Show that you’ve heard and understood – this way, your child will be much more likely to accept your answer. It can also help to show some empathy, even if you don’t say plan to say yes. For example, ‘Oh, I can see why you would love that. How cool’.</p>

<p><strong>3. Pause and decide</strong><br />
A brief pause gives you a chance to think about the request. It also sends your child the message that you’re putting some thought into it. Ask yourself, ‘Do I need to say no, or can I say yes? If it’s not a yes, can I negotiate?’</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Often, you’ll be able to say yes. At other times, you might be able to negotiate with your child and come up with a solution you can both accept. Either way, consistent and fair responses from you will help your child learn the best way to ask for things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>When you need to say no</h2>

<p>Saying no can be hard – after all, you want to make your child happy. But sometimes children can’t have what they want. Here’s how to make saying no work for you:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Give your reason first.</strong> If you’ve decided to say no, give your reasons first. This will help your child understand your decision. If children feel disappointed because you’ve said no, they might not take in the reason behind it. For example, ‘We don’t have time for a ride on the merry-go-round now. We’ll do it next time’.</li>
	<li><strong>Stick with your decision.</strong> If you change your mind, your child will learn that no isn’t final and that it’s worth arguing with you. And if you give in when your child is misbehaving, she’ll learn that this is a way to get what she wants.</li>
	<li><strong>Offer something else</strong>, if you can. For example, ‘I can’t buy you this because it’s too expensive. Let’s go home and make our own snack together’.</li>
	<li><strong>Give your child constructive feedback.</strong> If your child accepts no for an answer, give lots of praise. For example, ‘I really liked the way you said “OK” when I said no’. Or ‘It was great how we worked that out together’.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Being able to take no for an answer is an important social and emotional skill. It’s part of helping children learn how to self-regulate and handle disappointment. Saying no to your child also shows him when and how to be assertive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Reducing the need to say no</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to help your child learn how to cope with being told no is not to say it too much. When you keep no for decisions that really matter, your child will take it more seriously.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for reducing the number of times you say no:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Set some ground rules.</strong> For example, before you go shopping, talk to your child about why you’re going. Let your child know what you expect and the rules about asking for things. This can cut down on the number of times you need to say no. For example, ‘We’ll have a snack when we get home from the shops’, or ‘No asking on this shopping trip’.</li>
	<li><strong>Say yes</strong> if you can. For example, ‘OK, George can come over after school if it’s OK with his dad’.</li>
	<li><strong>Negotiate instead of saying no</strong> – but only if your child is willing to negotiate and compromise too. For example, ‘We can’t go to the park today, but we can go tomorrow’.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Children learn to predict what their parents will say yes to, based on past experience. It means they get more persuasive, and it also means you need to pay attention and be consistent about when you say yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Asking for things at different ages</h2>

<p>Toddlers often communicate what they want in simple ways. For example, they might make noises or point at what they want. But when you say no, toddlers can find the disappointment too much to manage. Tantrums are a normal response when you say no, because toddlers are still developing self-regulation and language skills.</p>

<p>By school age, children have more language skills, which they can use to negotiate and compromise when they ask for things. From around the age of eight years, you can expect some convincing arguments about why you should let your child have or do something!</p>

<p>When you say no to your school-age child, she’ll be disappointed but she’s less likely to have a tantrum than a younger child. This is because she has learned more self-regulation and understands why you’re saying no.</p>",1601,56,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/family-life/shopping-with-children/when-children-ask-for-things"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/family-life/shopping-with-children/when-children-ask-for-things</a></p>",en,published
401,Developmental delay,Children with developmental delay take longer to develop new skills than most other children. See your GP or child and family health nurse if you think your child might have developmental delay. Health and education professionals can support children with development delay.,"<h1>About developmental delay</h1>

<p>When young children are slower to develop physical, emotional, social and communication skills than expected, it’s called developmental delay.</p>

<p>Developmental delay can show up in the way children move, communicate, think and learn, or behave with others. When more than one of these areas is affected, it might be called global developmental delay.</p>

<p>Developmental delay might be short term, or it might be the first sign of a long-term problem.</p>

<p>Long-term developmental delays are also called developmental disabilities. Examples include learning<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/learning-disabilities-signs-and-support""> </a>disabilities, cerebral<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cerebral-palsy""> </a>palsy, intellectual<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/intellectual-disability""> </a>disability and autism<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asd-overview""> </a>spectrum<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asd-overview""> </a>disorder.</p>

<p>Usually health professionals use the term ‘developmental delay’ only until they can work out what’s causing the delay. If and when they find the cause, they’ll use a name that better explains the child’s condition.</p>

<h2>Signs of developmental delay</h2>

<p>Every child develops differently, and there’s a big range of ‘normal’ in children’s development.</p>

<p>But as a general guide, you might be concerned about developmental delay if you notice that, over several months, your child isn’t developing motor, social or language skills at the same rate as other children the same age.</p>

<h2>Worried about developmental delay: what to do</h2>

<p>As a parent, you know your child better than anyone else.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned about your child’s development, trust your instincts and talk to your doctor, child and family health nurse or paediatrician.</p>

<p>These health professionals can diagnose developmental delay after assessing your child. Or they can refer you to other professionals who can help.</p>

<h2>People who can help children with developmental delay</h2>

<p>Your doctor, child and family health nurse or paediatrician can help if you think your child might have developmental delay, or your child has a developmental delay diagnosis. The following professionals can also help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>audiologist</li>
	<li>occupational therapist</li>
	<li>physiotherapist</li>
	<li>psychologist</li>
	<li>social worker</li>
	<li>special education teacher</li>
	<li>speech pathologist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Living with developmental delay</h2>

<p>Like other children, children with developmental delay keep learning. But they take longer to develop new skills, and they might learn in slightly different ways from other children.</p>

<p>For example, most children can learn skills quickly and by example. But children with developmental delay might need to be shown skills in smaller, simpler steps. They might also need more time and opportunities to practice skills.</p>

<p>At preschool or school, your child might need extra support to do well. It’s always a good idea to talk with preschools and about your child’s needs. And if your child has a disability diagnosis, you might be able to get funding and other support.</p>

<p>If your child has developmental delay, it’s easy to get caught up in supporting his needs. But it’s important to look after your own wellbeing and get support for yourself too. If you’re physically and mentally well, you’ll be better able to care for your child.</p>

<h2>Causes of developmental delay</h2>

<p>Lots of different things can cause children to develop more slowly than others.</p>

<p>Developmental delay might happen because of genetic conditions like Down<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/down-syndrome""> </a>syndrome or because of complications during pregnancy and birth, like premature birth.</p>

<p>Other causes for short-term delays include physical illness, long periods in hospital, and family stress.</p>

<p>In many cases, the cause of developmental delay isn’t known.</p>",9031,6,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"491, 131, 1046",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/developmental-delay"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/developmental-delay</a></p>",en,published
406,Language development in children: 0-8 years,"Language development in children is amazing, and it is a development that many parents really look forward to. The secret to helping children learn language is very simple: talk together very often and listen very often.","<h2>Language development in children: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Language development is a critical part of child development.</p>

<p>It supports your child’s ability to communicate, and express and understand feelings. It also supports thinking and problem-solving, and developing and maintaining relationships. Learning to understand, use and enjoy language is the critical first step in literacy, and the basis for learning to read and write.</p>

<p>In their first 12 months, babies develop many of the foundations that underpin speech and language development. And they keep developing language skills at an amazing rate in the first three years of life.</p>

<h2>How to encourage early language development in children</h2>

<p>The best way to encourage your child’s speech and language development is to <strong>do lots of talking together</strong> about things that interest your child. It is all about following your child’s lead as they show you what they are interested in by waving, pointing, babbling or using words.</p>

<p><strong>Talking with your child</strong><br />
Talk to your child and treat them as a talker, beginning in the first 12 months. When you finish talking, give your child a turn and wait for them to respond. And when your child starts babbling, copy your child and babble back. You will probably find that your child babbles back to you again. This keeps the talking going and is great fun.</p>

<p><strong>Responding to your child</strong><br />
As your child grows up and starts to use gestures, you can respond to your child’s attempts to communicate. For example, if your child shakes their head, respond as if your child is saying ‘No’. If your child points to a toy, respond as if your child is saying, ‘Can I have that?’ or ‘I like that’.</p>

<p>When your child starts using words, you can <strong>repeat and build on what your child says</strong>. For example, if your child says, ‘Apple,’ you can say, ‘You want a red apple?’</p>

<p>When you tune in and respond to your child, it encourages your child to communicate. You’ll be amazed at how much your child has to say, even before words develop.</p>

<p><strong>Everyday talking</strong><br />
Talking about what is happening in your daily life together is a great way to increase the number of words your child hears. You can talk about things that make sense to your child, like what you are seeing or doing together – the key is to use lots of different words and in different contexts. For example, you can talk to your child about an orange tree and about cutting up an orange for lunch. This helps your child learn the meaning and function of words in their world.</p>

<p>It does not matter if your child does not understand, because understanding will grow as your child develops.</p>

<p>From the time your child starts telling stories, encourage your child to <strong>talk about things in the past and in the future</strong>. For example, at the end of the day, you could talk about plans for the next day, by making a shopping list together or deciding what to take on a visit to grandma. Or when you come home from an outing together, you could talk about it.</p>

<p><strong>Reading with your baby</strong><br />
Read and share lots of books with your child, and read more complex books as your child grows. Reading lets your child hear words in different contexts, which helps with learning the meaning and function of words.</p>

<p>Linking what is in the book to what is happening in your child’s life is a good way to get your child talking. You can also encourage talking by chatting about interesting pictures in the books you read with your child.</p>

<p>When you read aloud with your child, you can point to words as you say them. This shows your child the link between written and spoken words, and helps your child learn that words are distinct parts of language. These are important concepts for developing literacy.</p>

<p>Your local library is a great source of new books.</p>

<p>If your family speaks two languages, you can encourage your child’s language development in both languages – for example, English and Serbian. Bilingual children can achieve language development milestones at a similar rate to children who speak one language.</p>

<h2>Language development: the first eight years</h2>

<p>Here are just a few of the important things your child might achieve in language development between three months and eight years.</p>

<p><strong>3-12 months</strong><br />
In this period, your baby will most likely coo and laugh, play with sounds and begin to communicate with gestures like waving. Babbling is an important developmental stage during the first year.</p>

<p>Babbling is often followed by the ‘jargon phase’ where your child might sound like they’re talking or having a conversation. At this stage, though, this ‘speech’ doesn’t mean anything. First words often start by around 12 months.</p>

<p>You might hear babbling, jargon and new words together as your child gets closer to saying first words.</p>

<p>If your baby is not babbling and is not using gestures by 12 months, talk to your doctor, nurse or another health professional.</p>

<p>Find out more about language development from 3-12 months.</p>

<p><strong>12-18 months</strong><br />
At this age, children often say their first words with meaning. For example, when your child says ‘Dada’, your child is actually calling for dad. In the next few months, your child will keep adding more words to their vocabulary. Your child can understand more than they can say and can follow simple instructions too. For example, your child can understand you when you say ‘No’ – although they will not always obey!</p>

<p><strong>18 months to 2 years</strong><br />
In your child’s second year, their vocabulary has grown and they will start to put two words together into short ‘sentences’. Your child will understand much of what you say, and you can understand what your child says to you (most of the time!).</p>

<p>Language development varies hugely, but if your child does not have some words by around 18 months, talk to your doctor, nurse or another health professional.</p>

<p>Find out more about language development from 1-2 years.</p>

<p><strong>2-3 years</strong><br />
Your child can speak in longer, more complex sentences now, and is getting better at saying words correctly. Your child might play and talk at the same time. Strangers can probably understand most of what your child says by the time your child is three.</p>

<p>Find out more about language development from 2-3 years.</p>

<p><strong>3-5 years</strong><br />
You can expect longer, more abstract and more complex conversations now. For example, your child might say things like, ‘Will I grow into a watermelon because I swallowed the watermelon seed?’</p>

<p>Your child will probably also want to talk about a wide range of topics, and vocabulary will keep growing. Your child might show understanding of basic grammar, as they experiment with more complex sentences that have words like ‘because’, ‘if’, ‘so’ or ‘when’. And you can look forward to some entertaining stories too.</p>

<p>Find out more about language development from 3-4 years and language development from 4-5 years.</p>

<p><strong>5-8 years</strong><br />
During the early school years, your child will learn more words and start to understand how the sounds within language work together. Your child will also become a better storyteller, as they learn to put words together in different ways and build different types of sentences. These skills also let your child share ideas and opinions. By eight years, your child will be able to have adult-like conversations.</p>

<p>Find out more about language development from 5-8 years.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates, and there is a big range of ‘normal’ in development. But you know your child best. If you have any concerns about your child’s language development talk to your doctor, nurse or another health professional or see a speech pathologist.</p>",461,6,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"196, 201, 261",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/development/language-development/language-development-0-8"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/development/language-development/language-development-0-8</a></p>",en,published
416,2-3 years: toddler development,"There is so much going on in toddler development at 2-3 years. At this age, expect big feelings, tantrums, simple sentences, pretend play, independence, new thinking skills and much more. Talking and listening, reading, working on everyday skills and cooking with your child are good for development.
Speak with your doctor or nurse if you are concerned about toddler development or you need support.","<h2>Toddler development at 2-3 years: what is happening</h2>

<p><strong>Feelings</strong><br />
This is one of your child’s most important ages for <strong>emotional development</strong>.</p>

<p>Your toddler is going through lots of emotions while also learning about other people’s feelings. Temper tantrums are normal, because children often do not know how to put words to ‘big’ emotions like frustration, anger, embarrassment, guilt and shame.</p>

<p>Your toddler is also starting to understand how her behaviour affects you and how your behaviour affects her. She will not have as much separation anxiety, and she might not get so upset when you leave her.</p>

<p><strong>Talking</strong><br />
Around <strong>two years</strong>, your toddler might be able to use sentences of 2-3 words and say ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’. He will learn and use lots of words and will be easier to understand when he’s talking.</p>

<p>At <strong>three years</strong>, your child will be able to use sentences of 3-5 words, or even more. She will start learning how to take turns when speaking, and might be able to have a short conversation with you.</p>

<p>Your child is learning how to talk about things that have happened during the day. With your help, he might be able to put things in order to make a simple story – for example, ‘I go shop’. ‘And what did you do at the shop?’ ‘Buy milk.’ By three years, he might be able to tell a simple ‘made-up’ story based on his experiences, but it will probably be quite short.</p>

<p>At this age your child will also talk about people and objects that are not with her – for example, ‘Grandma at the shops’, or ‘My ball in tree’.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong><br />
Everything your child has learned so far has developed his thinking.</p>

<p>Your child is starting to understand concepts like time and opposites – for example, big/small and day/night. She will also start to point to body parts based on what they do, sort objects, and match shapes and colours. And she is starting to remember what some things look like – for example, apples look red and round.</p>

<p>Your child solves problems by trying things out.</p>

<p><strong>Playing and learning</strong><br />
Play is important because it is how your child learns.</p>

<p>Your child will enjoy playing with others, playing dress ups, having tea parties, painting with his fingers or a brush, and playing ‘rough and tumble’. When he plays with you or other children, you might find that your child is getting better at taking turns.</p>

<p>Telling stories, singing and reading are also fun things for your child to do at this age.</p>

<p><strong>Everyday skills</strong><br />
Around this time, your child is keen to <strong>do more things for herself</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, your child can probably wash his own hands, wash himself at bath time, feed himself and get dressed – although he is probably better at taking clothes off than putting them on! And he is still learning so you might still need to help.</p>

<p>You can build your child’s confidence in doing things herself by letting her help you around the house with chores like sweeping or dusting. She will feel very proud when she’s a good helper.</p>

<p>Your toddler might even be ready to start toilet training. Some of the signs your child is ready for toilet training are if he:</p>

<ul>
	<li>can do most things that you ask without your help</li>
	<li>is interested in watching others go to the toilet – this can be awkward or make you uncomfortable at first, but it is a good way to introduce things</li>
	<li>lets you know when he has urinated or defecated in his nappy</li>
	<li>can follow simple instructions like ‘Give the ball to Daddy’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch and see whether your child is ready for toilet training – but try not to push it. Going to the toilet is<strong> one of the hardest things for your child to learn</strong> because it uses so many skills. For example, your child must know when she needs to urinate or defecate, understand that she should urinate or defecate in the toilet, be able to walk and climb onto the potty or toilet, and pull clothes up and down.</p>

<p>If you start toilet training too early, it might take your child a while to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Moving</strong><br />
Your toddler can run and will probably fall less. He is starting to walk up and down stairs on his own, but will sometimes use the rail for balance. He is now better at throwing overarm, kicking and catching a ball, and might even stand on one foot for a few seconds.</p>

<p>If you are around while your child explores, she feels reassured and safe. This helps your child to build confidence to try new things and explore on her own.</p>

<p>With your child so active, it is a good idea to look at how you can make your home safe for him to move around in.<br />
<br />
At this age, your toddler might also:</p>

<ul>
	<li>jump on the spot</li>
	<li>ride a tricycle</li>
	<li>recognise objects and name them</li>
	<li>use one foot and then the other foot when walking up stairs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helping toddler development at 2-3 years</h2>

<p>Here are some simple things you can do to help your child’s development at this age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child the chance to play with others: play is a great way for your child to make friends and learn how to be with other children. But don’t expect sharing and taking turns just yet – toddlers still think that everything belongs to them.</li>
	<li>Encourage everyday skills like using a spoon and putting on shoes. These skills involve both small and big muscle movements, as well as your toddler’s ability to think about what she’s doing.</li>
	<li>Talk with your toddler: naming and talking about everyday things – body parts, toys and household items like spoons or chairs – helps develop your child’s language skills. At this age, you can teach your child that a ‘chair’ can be a ‘big chair’, ‘red chair’ or even a ‘big red chair’.</li>
	<li>Give meaning to your child’s talking by listening and talking back to him. If your toddler says ‘Mama milk’, you might reply by saying ‘You want Mum to get you some milk?’ This also makes your child feel valued and loved.</li>
	<li>Read to your toddler: you can encourage your child’s talking and imagination by reading together, telling stories, singing songs and reciting nursery rhymes.</li>
	<li>Do some cooking with your child: this helps your toddler to get interested in healthy food, learn some new words, and start to become familiar with maths concepts like ‘half’, ‘1 teaspoon’ or ‘30 minutes’. You can give her simple things to do, like tossing a salad or putting together sandwiches.</li>
</ul>

<p>When your child learns a new skill, celebrate his achievements with lots of praise and positive attention. It is also a good idea to help and encourage him to keep doing the things he has learned, even if he finds them hard.</p>

<h2>Parenting a toddler at 2-3 years</h2>

<p>As a parent, you are always learning. It is okay to feel confident about what you know. And it is also okay to admit you do not know something and ask questions or get help.</p>

<p>When you are focused on looking after a child, you might forget or run out of time to look after yourself. But looking after yourself physically, mentally and emotionally will help your child grow and thrive.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might feel frustrated, upset or overwhelmed. <strong>It is okay to take some time out</strong> until you feel calmer. Put your toddler in a safe place, or ask someone else to look after her for a while. Try going to another room to breathe deeply, or call a family member or friend to talk things through.</p>

<p><strong>Never shake a toddler.</strong> It can cause bleeding inside the brain and likely permanent brain damage.</p>

<p>It is okay to ask for help. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the demands of caring for your toddler talk to a trusted friend or your partner. You might also like to try our ideas for dealing with anger, anxiety and stress.</p>

<h2>When to be concerned about toddler development at 2 years</h2>

<p>See your nurse or doctor if you have any concerns or notice that your two-year-old has any of the following issues.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing, hearing and communicating</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has trouble seeing or hearing things</li>
	<li>is not using two words together – for example, ‘Red car’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behaviour and play</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cannot follow simple instructions – for example, ‘Please give me the ball’</li>
	<li>does not copy actions or words – for example, when singing ‘Heads, shoulders, knees and toes’</li>
	<li>does not pretend during play – for example, does not pretend to feed a doll</li>
	<li>is not showing his feelings</li>
	<li>does not come to you for affection or comfort.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Movement and motor skills</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cannot walk up and down stairs, even if holding on to you or a rail</li>
	<li>cannot run</li>
	<li>finds it hard to handle small objects – for example, a crayon</li>
	<li>is not scribbling or trying to draw.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to be concerned about toddler development at 3 years</h2>

<p>See your nurse or doctor if you notice your three-year-old has any of the following issues.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing, hearing and communicating</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>does not look you in the eye</li>
	<li>has trouble seeing or hearing things</li>
	<li>is not using three-word sentences</li>
	<li>is often hard to understand when talking to you, family or friends.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behaviour and play</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>does not understand simple instructions – for example, ‘Please give me the ball’</li>
	<li>is not interested in other children</li>
	<li>finds it difficult to separate from her primary caregiver</li>
	<li>does not pretend during play – for example, does not pretend to play ‘shopping’ or ‘riding on the bus’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Movement and motor skills</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cannot run</li>
	<li>is not scribbling or drawing</li>
	<li>finds it hard to handle small objects – for example, a pencil or crayon.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should see a child health professional if your child loses skills he had before.</p>

<p>You should also see your nurse or doctor if you or your partner experiences the signs of postnatal depression in women or postnatal depression in men. Symptoms of postnatal depression include feeling sad and crying for no obvious reason, feeling irritable, having difficulty coping and feeling very anxious.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different speeds. If you are worried about whether your child’s development is ‘normal’, it might help to know that ‘normal’ varies a lot. But if you still feel that something is not quite right, see your nurse or doctor.</p>",676,6,"51,52",59,60,"81, 241, 231, 86, 496, 76, 206, 2471",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/development-tracker-1-3-years/2-3-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/development-tracker-1-3-years/2-3-years</a></p>",en,published
436,Siblings of children with disability: how they feel,"It is normal for typically developing children to have many different feelings about siblings with disability. Their feelings might be positive and negative. Children can find it harder if siblings with disability have challenging behaviour or communication difficulties. Your child’s age, personality, temperament and birth order can affect how he feels about having a sibling with disability.","<h2>Upsides of having siblings with disability</h2>

<p>There are many positives for your child in having a sibling with disability.</p>

<p>Children who have a sibling with disability are often <strong>more caring and kind</strong>, sensitive and responsive to the needs of others, tolerant and compassionate, mature, responsible, independent and empathetic. They are also unlikely to take their own good health for granted.</p>

<h2>How siblings might feel and think about disability</h2>

<p>Siblings of children with disability have good times and not so good times, just like everyone else. It is <strong>normal for your child to have lots of different feelings</strong> about your family situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes your typically developing child might feel happy about good things that happen – for example, when her brother or sister with disability starts to talk. At other times she might feel sad, angry or confused about things that happen – for example, if her brother or sister with disability takes a toy, or goes into hospital.</p>

<p>Here are some of the many and varied feelings that siblings of children with disability experience.</p>

<h2>Pride</h2>

<p>Your child might feel proud of being the sibling of a child with disability and be pleased when his brother or sister learns a new skill like climbing up a ladder at the playground. Your child might also feel proud of understanding disability. </p>

<h2>Anger, resentment and jealousy</h2>

<p>Your child might think her sibling with disability is getting too much attention. For example, she might be jealous that her sibling goes to therapy. She might feel that it takes up a lot of your time and stops her from being able to do what she wants.</p>

<p>Your child might feel that family rules and responsibilities are not fair. For example, he might feel angry if his sibling has fewer or no chores to do, or if his sibling seems to ‘get away with’ challenging behaviour.</p>

<h2>Embarrassment and guilt</h2>

<p>Your child might be embarrassed about how his sibling looks and behaves in public, and what his friends might think. For example, he might think, ‘They will not want to be my friend if they see my brother banging his head’. He might feel guilty about having these thoughts.</p>

<p>Your child might also feel embarrassed about answering questions about her sibling, especially if she does not understand the disability and what caused it.</p>

<h2>Sadness</h2>

<p>Your child might feel sad that his brother or sister cannot do as much as he can, or because he cannot play the same games with his brother or sister that other siblings can. He might just be sad because family life is not like it was before.</p>

<h2>Fear and worry</h2>

<p>Depending on your child’s stage of development, she might worry about whether she will get sick too, or about how sick her brother or sister is. This might be a particular issue if your child does not understand what the disability is, what caused it, or why her sibling has to have medication or intervention.</p>

<p>If your child with disability has challenging and unpredictable behaviour, this might be a worry for your typically developing child. He might worry about when the behaviour will happen next, or feel afraid that he might get hurt.</p>

<p>If your child is older, he might worry about what responsibility and role she will have in her sibling’s life. She might worry that she will spend her adult life caring for her sibling.</p>

<p>And your child might just be scared about what will happen to her or her sibling and family in the future.</p>

<h2>A sense of being alone</h2>

<p>Your child might feel alone because he feels that no one understands what it is like to have a sibling with disability. If your child has caring responsibilities, he might feel that he does not have enough time for friends, or he might not want to invite friends over because his brother or sister has to be with them.</p>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<p>Your child might feel stressed for many reasons. For example, she might sense that you are stressed, or she might be trying too hard to be good and not cause trouble.</p>

<p>If your child is older, he might put pressure on himself to achieve or to cope with personal problems without asking for your help because he does not want to add to your burden.</p>

<p>You can support siblings of children with disability by letting them know that it is okay to sometimes feel angry and worried, and to sometimes feel happy and proud. All these feelings are normal and understandable.</p>

<h2>Factors that affect thoughts and feelings about siblings with disability</h2>

<p>Many things can affect how siblings of children with disability think, feel and behave. Some are individual to your child like her age, personality, temperament and birth order. Other things outside your child can also affect how she feels.</p>

<p><strong>Age</strong><br />
If your child is older, he is likely to find it easier to understand and adjust to the way things are. A younger child might be more worried about himself. For example, he might think, ‘Will I catch the disability?’</p>

<p><strong>Birth order</strong><br />
Children born into a family in which a child with disability is their older sibling generally take it in their stride. They have never known any different, but it is still important to be aware of their thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Type or severity of disability</strong><br />
Children often find it harder if their sibling has trouble communicating wants or needs or has challenging behaviour. If your child cannot understand her sibling or her sibling cannot understand her, this can affect the relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Medical and care needs</strong><br />
If your child with disability needs extra care and services, it might mean your family has to make changes that affect family routines and daily life. For example, it might affect getting to school on time, or it might change the activities you can all do together.</p>

<p><strong>Family and parental wellbeing</strong><br />
How your family adjusts to having a child with disability, including your relationship with your partner, can influence your children’s wellbeing.</p>",936,6,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"501, 506, 511, 516, 521",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/disability/family-life/siblings/siblings-of-children-with-disability"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/disability/family-life/siblings/siblings-of-children-with-disability</a></p>",en,published
446,Language delay,"When children have unusual difficulties with speaking and/or understanding, it might be language delay.
If you think your child might have a language delay, see your doctor, nurse, your child’s teacher or a speech pathologist. Support for children with language delay might include special group programs, pictures and books.","<h2>What is a language delay?</h2>

<p>A language delay is when a child has difficulties understanding and/or using spoken language. These difficulties are unusual for the child’s age.</p>

<p>The difficulties might be with:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>saying first words or learning words</li>
	<li>putting words together to make sentences</li>
	<li>building vocabulary</li>
	<li>understanding words or sentences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some language delays are associated with conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Down syndrome or deafness and hearing impairment. Many happen on their own.</p>

<h2>Language delay, speech disorder or developmental language disorder?</h2>

<p>A language delay is different from a speech disorder or developmental language disorder.</p>

<p>A speech (sound) disorder is when children have difficulty pronouncing the sounds in words. This can make their speech difficult to understand. Children with a speech disorder might have language skills that are otherwise good. That is, they understand words and sentences well and can form sentences the right way.</p>

<p>If a child has a language delay that does not go away, it might be a sign of a <strong>developmental language disorder</strong>. Children with a developmental language disorder have difficulties understanding and/or speaking. These difficulties affect their everyday lives.</p>

<p>Children with speech disorders do not necessarily have language delay or developmental language disorder. And not all children who have language delay have problems with speech.</p>

<p>Children raised in bilingual families might start off learning their languages more slowly than children speaking only one language. This is not considered language delay. School-age bilingual children can learn to read and write English just as well as their peers.</p>

<h2>When to get help for language delay</h2>

<p>Children develop language at different rates. So comparing your child to other children of the same age might not help you to know whether your child has a language delay.</p>

<p>It is best to <strong>seek professional advice if you see any of the following signs</strong> in your child at different ages.</p>

<p><strong>By 12 months</strong><br />
Your child is not trying to communicate with you using sounds, gestures and/or words, particularly when needing help or wanting something.</p>

<p><strong>By 2 years</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>is not saying about 50 different words</li>
	<li>is not combining two or more words together – for example, ‘More drink’, ‘Mum up’</li>
	<li>is not producing words spontaneously – that is, your child only copies words or phrases from others</li>
	<li>does not seem to understand simple instructions or questions – for example, ‘Get your shoes’, ‘Want a drink?’ or ‘Where’s Daddy?’</li>
</ul>

<p>By two years, about one in five children shows signs of having language delay. These children are sometimes called ‘late talkers’. Many of them will catch up as they get older. But some will continue to have trouble with language.</p>

<p><strong>At about 3 years</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>is not combining words into longer phrases or sentences – for example, ‘Help me Mummy’ or ‘Want more drink’</li>
	<li>does not seem to understand longer instructions or questions – for example, ‘Get your shoes and put them in the box’ or ‘What do you want to eat for lunch today?’</li>
	<li>takes little or no interest in books</li>
	<li>is not asking questions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>From 4-5 years and older</strong><br />
Some children still have difficulties with language by the time they start preschool or school. If these difficulties cannot be explained by other things like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or hearing loss, it might be developmental language disorder.</p>

<p>Children with <strong>developmental language disorder</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>struggle to learn new words and make conversation</li>
	<li>use short, simple sentences, and often leave out important words in sentences</li>
	<li>respond to just part of an instruction</li>
	<li>struggle to use past, present or future tense the right way – for example, they say ‘skip’ instead of ‘skipped’ when talking about activities they have already done</li>
	<li>find it hard to use the right words when talking </li>
	<li>might not understand the meaning of words, sentences or stories.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At any age</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>has been diagnosed with a hearing loss, developmental delay or syndrome in which language might be affected – for example, ASD and Down syndrome, or other syndromes like Fragile X</li>
	<li>stops doing things she used to do – for example, she stops talking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children having difficulties with language need help as early as possible. You are the best judge of your child’s language development. If you are concerned, trust your instincts and speak with your GP, nurse, your child’s teacher or a speech pathologist. If this professional is not concerned about your child, but you are still worried, seek another opinion.</p>

<h2>Where to get help for language delay</h2>

<p>If you think your child is having trouble with language, talk to a professional – for example:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>teachers or educators at your child care centre, preschool or school</li>
	<li>a speech pathologist</li>
	<li>an audiologist</li>
	<li>a family doctor or paediatrician</li>
	<li>a nurse</li>
	<li>a psychologist.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <strong>you think your child’s main problem is understanding and using language</strong>, you might want to visit a speech pathologist. Speech pathologists can use language tests to assess how your child uses words and responds to requests, commands or questions.</p>

<p>If <strong>you think your child might be hard of hearing</strong> or have a hearing impairment, it is best to have your child’s hearing checked by an audiologist. Hearing loss could interfere with your child’s language development and communication.</p>

<h2>Support for children with language delay</h2>

<p>If your child is diagnosed with language delay, the health professional you are working with might recommend <strong>group programs that build language skills</strong>. The professional might also help your child develop other ways to communicate, like using picture boards or books.</p>

<p>The professional might give you <strong>strategies that you can use at home</strong> to help your child communicate. This might include giving your child lots of time to begin a conversation. You can also help your child by responding and expanding on his efforts to communicate, whether it’s with words, actions or sounds.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Causes of language delay</h2>

<p>We do not know what causes language delay in most cases. But we do know there is likely to be a <strong>genetic or biological component</strong>. That is, language delay might run in families.</p>

<p>Language delay is more likely for:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>boys</li>
	<li>children who have a close family member with a history of a language delay or communication disorder</li>
	<li>children who have a developmental disorder or syndrome like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or Down syndrome</li>
	<li>children with ongoing hearing problems and ear infections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, delays in communication skills can be signs of more serious developmental disorders including hearing impairment, developmental delay, intellectual disability and ASD. You know your child better than anyone else. If you’re worried, talk to your health professional.</p>",4041,6,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"196, 526, 201, 531",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/development/language-development/language-delay"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/development/language-development/language-delay</a></p>",en,published
456,Hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and jaundice. See your doctor if your child has symptoms of hepatitis A.  Immunization and good hygiene are the best ways to prevent Hepatitis A.","<h1>About hepatitis A</h1>

<p>Hepatitis A is caused by a virus. If you get infected with this virus, it causes inflammation of the liver.</p>

<p>The hepatitis A virus lives in poo. It spreads when children or adults come into contact with objects, food or water that have been contaminated by an infected person’s poo.</p>

<p>Hepatitis A is very common in less develped countries, especially in areas where there are no good sewerage systems. This means it’s a particular risk if live or you’re travelling to those areas.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis A symptoms</h2>

<p>The hepatitis A virus infects a person 1-2 months before any symptoms appear – this is called the ‘incubation period’. This long incubation period can make it hard to know exactly when or where the infection happened.</p>

<p>Children with hepatitis A usually have milder symptoms than adults. In fact, most children with hepatitis A, especially very young children, <strong>don’t have many symptoms</strong>. It’s possible for them to have hepatitis A without you realising. Other children with hepatitis A can be very sick and will need to go to hospital, but this isn’t common.</p>

<p>When hepatitis A symptoms do happen, they can happen quite suddenly. They include general symptoms like tiredness, fever, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>

<p>Later, the child’s skin might feel very itchy, and her tummy might be a little swollen and sore, especially over the upper right side where the liver is. After several days, your child’s wee might turn dark yellow or brown, and her skin and eyes might go a yellowish colour. This is called jaundice.</p>

<p>Children with hepatitis A usually get completely better after a week or two, but occasionally it can take longer than this. Hepatitis A infection doesn’t usually last very long, unlike hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. In rae caes hepatitis A  virus might cause destruction of the liver that necessitated urgent and critical care.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about hepatitis A?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the GP if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>develops yellow skin or eyes</li>
	<li>has very dark brown wee</li>
	<li>has stomach pain that continues longer than a few days</li>
	<li>has an unexplained rash.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child has any of the above symptoms, or if you think you or your child might have come into contact with the hepatitis A virus, see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Tests for hepatitis A</h2>

<p>If your doctor thinks that your child might have a hepatitis A infection, the doctor will ask for blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis A treatment</h2>

<p>There’s no specific treatment for hepatitis A, so <strong>treatment aims to ease symptoms</strong>.</p>

<p>If your child has diarrhoea or has been vomiting, it’s important to make sure he drinks enough fluids to avoid dehydration.</p>

<p>If your child’s symptoms are severe, she might need to go to hospital. This is quite unusual.</p>

<p>Don’t give your child paracetamol without first checking with your doctor. If your child’s liver isn’t working properly because of a hepatitis A infection, it might be damaged by normal doses of paracetamol.</p>

<h2>Prevention of hepatitis A</h2>

<p>In any part of the world, but especially in places without good sewerage systems, the key to preventing hepatitis A is good hygiene. This includes washing your hands after going to the toilet and before eating.</p>

<p>Immunisation against hepatitis A is recommended for children over the age of 12 months if you’re residing or travelling to places where there might be a high risk of coming into contact with hepatitis A. </p>

461,Heart murmur,A heart murmur is an extra noise in the heart. Several things can cause a heart murmur in children and teenagers. A heart murmur doesn’t always mean that your child has a heart problem or heart disease.,"<h1>Causes of heart murmur in children</h1>

<p>Blood flowing through the heart usually makes a lub-dub noise. A heart murmur is an extra noise in the heart – a whoosh, swish or hum. It happens when the blood isn’t flowing smoothly through the heart.</p>

<p>Most heart murmurs are innocent heart murmurs. This means there’s nothing wrong with your child’s heart, and the murmur usually goes away with time. Innocent heart murmurs can happen when your child has a fever.</p>

<p>It’s thought that at least half of all children have innocent heart murmurs. They’re the most common kind of heart murmurs in children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Abnormal heart murmurs are from heart disease or other heart problems like faulty heart valves or a hole in the heart wall. These problems can be either present from birth or happen later in life.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of heart murmur in children</h2>

<p>If your child has an innocent heart murmur, she’ll have absolutely no symptoms of heart disease.</p>

<p>If your child has an abnormal heart murmur, he’ll usually have symptoms related to heart disease. These might include tireness, breathlessness and/or blueness of the lips, fingers and toes. If the murmur is present from birth, these symptoms might appear immediately or soon after the birth.</p>

<p>You can’t hear a heart murmur without a doctor’s stethoscope.</p>

<h2>When to see a doctor about heart murmur symptoms</h2>

<p>Many, but not al,l problems with a baby’s heart are picked up at birth, or during your baby’s first few weeks, when the paediatrician checks over your newborn. </p>

<p>If you have any concerns about your child’s breathing or colour, you should see your doctor as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Tests for heart murmur</h2>

<p>If your doctor has any concerns about your child’s heart murmur, the doctor might order an ECG and a chest X-ray.</p>

<p>The doctor might also refer your child to a paediatric cardiologist, who might do an echocardiogram.</p>

<h2>Heart murmur treatment</h2>

466,"Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), SIDS and fatal sleep accidents","Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) covers both sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and fatal sleeping accidents.
Babies are particularly at risk of SUDI when three kinds of risk factors happen at once. These are vulnerability, age and environment. Many SUDI risks you can avoid. These include risks associated with babies’ sleep environments.","<h1>About sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)</h1>

<p>When babies under one year die unexpectedly in their sleep, it’s often described as sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI).</p>

<p>When these deaths are investigated, they’re often found to be one of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fatal sleeping accidents: these deaths happen when babies suffocate or get trapped or strangled by things in their sleeping environments.</li>
	<li>Sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS: this is when investigations can’t find a cause of death.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes SUDI can be explained by a serious illness or a medical condition that the baby was born with.</p>

<p>SUDI is rare and accounts for 2-5 deaths in every 10 000 births world widw in Australia.</p>

<h2>SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents: </h2>

<p>We don’t know exactly what causes sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), but we know that all babies are at risk of SUDI and <strong>we also know that there are some factors that increase SUDI risk. </strong></p>

<p>Some babies have an increased risk of SUDI. This includes babies who were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>exposed to tobacco smoke or drugs before they were born</li>
	<li>born prematurely or who were small when they were born.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Age</strong><br />
The risk of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents is greatest at 1-4 months, although the risk is there for the first 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong><br />
Babies’ sleep environments can increase their risk of SUDI including overheating and being exposed to tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>Babies who are already vulnerable and at a risky age are more likely to die of SUDI when they’re exposed to these risks.</p>

<p>You can’t usually control underlying vulnerabilities. And you can’t change your baby’s age, so you can’t control this type of risk. <strong>But you can reduce the overall risk of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents by following safe sleeping guidelines.</strong></p>

<h2>SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents: risks you can avoid</h2>

<p>Babies’ sleep environments include where and how babies sleep and what’s around babies when they sleep and at other times. Babies’ sleep environments have many risks for SUDI that can be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>These are risks you can avoid.</strong></p>

<p>Here are risks associated with how babies sleep. You should <strong>avoid</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>babies should not sleep on their tummies or sides. They should sleep on their back!! (babies can be placed on their stomachs when they are awake and someone is watching the child. This “tummy time” is good for the baby because it can help develop neck and shoulder muscles.)</li>
	<li>babies should not sleep with faces or heads covered.</li>
	<li>babies should not get to sleep get overheated – for example, by wearing too many clothes or hats or beanies to sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are risks associated with where babies sleep. You should <strong>avoid</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>babies should not sleep  on soft surfaces (like soft mattresses or waterbeds) or on sofas, with or without a parent</li>
	<li>babies should not co-sleeping with the mother or other family member!</li>
	<li>babies should not sleep where they could get trapped between mattress and cot, or between bed and wall.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are risks associated with what’s around babies. You should <strong>avoid</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>babies should not be exposed to tobacco smoke</li>
	<li>babies should not sleep with loose or fluffy bedding (like sheepskin or lamb’s wool), or with pillows, soft toys or cot bumpers</li>
	<li>babies should not sleep near things that could strangle them, like straps or cords from prams, car seats or blinds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Room share</strong>: Keep baby’s sleep area in the same room next to where you sleep until she is 1 year of age</p>

<h2>Impact of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents</h2>

<p>The sudden or unexpected death of a baby is one of the most difficult and devastating experiences that parents will ever face. They often feel anger, guilt, frustration and, above all, grief. There are support services available to parents and families at this difficult time.</p>",7656,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"54, 276, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/sudi"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/sudi</a></p>",en,published
471,Worms,It’s common for children aged 5-10 years to get worms (threadworms). Worm infections mostly don’t cause symptoms. Sometimes children get red and itchy bottoms. It is a good idea to treat everyone in the family with worming tablets. Prevent worm infections with good personal hygiene and household cleaning.,"<h1>About worms in kids</h1>

<p>Threadworms (also simply called ""worms"") are a type of parasite.</p>

<p>This article is about pinworms or threadworms, which are the most common type of worms in kids. Threadworms are also known as pinworms. Threadworms won’t hurt your child, and you can treat them easily. But they do spread between people very easily too.</p>

<p>Children can get threadworms when they accidentally get worm eggs on their hands and swallow them. This might happen if they come into contact with people with worms or with worm-infected dust, toys or bed linen.</p>

<p>Once swallowed, the eggs get into children’s small intestines, where they hatch and lay more eggs around the anus. This can make children’s bottoms very itchy. Sometimes worms get into girls’ vaginas and make this area itchy too. If children scratch their bottoms and then touch their mouths, they can swallow the eggs again, causing this cycle to repeat.</p>

<p>If children touch things around the house without washing their hands, the eggs might spread to other people in the house too.</p>

<h2>Worms in kids: signs and symptoms</h2>

<p>Most threadworm infections <strong>won’t cause any symptoms </strong>at all. But some children might have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>itchiness around the bottom and/or vagina, which is usually worse at night</li>
	<li>redness around the bottom area</li>
	<li>restlessness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some rare symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>visible worms – small, white and 8-13 mm long (often mistaken for bits of toilet paper!)</li>
	<li>stomach pain</li>
	<li>vulvovaginitis</li>
	<li>nausea and vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about worms?</h2>

<p>If your child has any of the signs and symptoms of worms, it’s a good idea to see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Tests for worms in kids</h2>

<p>Manytime your description  may be sufficient for diagnsing worms infection, however, your doctor might use the ‘sticky tape test’ to check for worm eggs or worms.</p>

<p>This involves putting sticky tape over your child’s anus early in the morning before having a bath, removing it and then putting it onto a glass slide. When the doctor or another professional looks at the slide under a microscope in a laboratory, they can see whether there are any worms or worm eggs.</p>

<h2>Treatments for worms in kids</h2>

<p>Threadworms in kids are easy to treat and usually aren’t serious.</p>

<p>Your doctor will probably tell you to give your child a dose of antiparasitic tablets, which you can get over the counter from a pharmacy. Your child usually needs to repeat the dose after two weeks to make sure all the worms are gone.</p>

<p>If your child is diagnosed with threadworms, it is a good idea to treat everyone in the household with antiparasitic tablets too. This stops the spread of worms between family members. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the eggs spread easily and it’s common for infections to come back.</p>

<h2>Prevention of worms in kids</h2>

<p>There are several ways to help prevent the spread of worms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Thoroughly wash<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/coronavirus-covid-19-guide/hand-washing-in-pictures""> </a>hands after going to the toilet and before handling food.</li>
	<li>Cut fingernails regularly.</li>
	<li>Try to encourage your child not to scratch around their bottom or suck thumbs or fingers.</li>
	<li>Treat everyone in the family with antiparasitic tablets when someone in the family has worms.</li>
	<li>If you or your child has worms, regularly wash clothes and bed linen in hot soapy water every day for up to several days after treatment.</li>
	<li>Clean toilet seats and potties regularly.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to take a shower or bath every day (morning is better to help remove eggs).</li>

476,Scabies,Scabies is a very itchy skin rash caused by small burrowing mites. It looks like red tracks and spots on the skin. Scabies spreads very easily and should be treated carefully.,"<h1>Scabies causes</h1>

<p>Scabies is caused by a tiny insect (mite) known as <em>Sarcoptes scabiei</em>. Female scabies mites lay their eggs in small tunnels that form as they burrow under the surface layer of the skin.</p>

<p>Scabies usually spreads through skin-to-skin contact. It often breaks out in kindergartens, schools and nursing homes (which parents of children might have visited).</p>

<p>Scabies doesn’t happen because your child or home is dirty.</p>

<h2>Scabies symptoms</h2>

<p>Scabies usually shows up as red lumps and threadlike ‘tracks’ on the skin.</p>

<p>The tracks appear especially between the fingers and toes, on the insides of wrists, on the backs of elbows, in the armpits, around the belly button and groin, and on the buttocks. In babies, the rash often appears on the head and face, on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and might look like little blisters or pimples.</p>

<p>Scabies is extremely itchy, especially at night, or after a hot bath or shower. Scratching affected areas sometimes leads to secondary infection.</p>

<p>It can take up to a month after infection for the rash to appear, because it takes this long for the scabies eggs to mature.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about scabies symptoms</h2>

<p>Your child should see your GP if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>itching goes on for more than a week, or initially stops and then comes back</li>
	<li>bleeding, scabs or pus-filled sores appear in the same area as the itching.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for scabies</h2>

<p>Your doctor might make diagnosis by inspection of your child's skin or might also take skin scrapings to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Scabies treatment</h2>

<p>Scabies spreads very easily, so your child must stay at home until treatment is completed.</p>

<p>Your doctor will prescribe a lotion or cream (usually 5% permethrin cream or 10% crotamiton) to put on your child’s skin from the neck down.</p>

<p>Don’t wash the lotion or cream off for 8-12 hours. If your child washes her hands during the treatment period, put the cream on her hands again.</p>

<p>Wash your child thoroughly 8-12 hours after applying the cream.</p>

<p>You’ll usually have to give your child this treatment twice, with a week between each application of the cream.</p>

<p>If your child has scabies, <strong>treat your whole family at the same time</strong>.</p>

<p>You should also wash all clothing, linen, towels and soft toys touched by your child during the last 3 days prior to treatment, using the hottest setting possible. This will destroy the mites and their eggs. Vacuum all carpets and mattresses. If there are things you can’t wash, spray them with insecticide and leave them closed in a plastic bag for around a week.</p>

<p>The itch can take up to six weeks to go away. This is usually because of an allergic response, not ongoing scabies. Treat the itch with calamine lotion or an antihistamine. If the itch doesn’t go away with this treatment, your doctor will prescribe a corticosteroid cream.</p>

<p>Don’t reapply the lotion or cream unless your doctor tells you to.</p>

<h2>Complications of scabies</h2>

<p>The itchy areas might get infected if your child scratches a lot. If this happens, he’ll need antibiotics.</p>

<h2>Prevention of scabies</h2>

<p>Prevent the spread of scabies by washing linen, towels, clothes and soft toys. Treat all family members at the same time, even if only one child is affected.</p>

481,Head lice,"It’s very common for children to get head lice, especially once they go to child care, preschool and school. You can usually treat head lice at home. Head lice are often called nits.","<h1>Causes of head lice or nits</h1>

<p>Head lice are tiny, wingless insects that live in human hair and feed on the blood circulating in the scalp.</p>

<p>Nits are the eggs of adult head lice. Once lice lay nits, the nits take about a week to hatch.</p>

<p>Head lice spread when people are in close contact – for example, when heads are close together, when you wear an affected person’s hat or scarf, or when you use an affected person’s comb or hair brush.</p>

<p>It’s common for children to get head lice because their heads are often close together as they play or do their schoolwork. Some children get head lice several times a year.</p>

<p>If your child gets head lice, it’s nothing to be embarrassed about. It doesn’t mean your child and home are dirty. Head lice don’t carry any diseases.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of head lice or nits</h2>

<p>If your child has head lice, the first thing you might notice is your child <strong>itching and scratching</strong>, especially around the back of his neck and behind his ears. But many children have no symptoms.</p>

<p>When you look closely at your child’s hair, you might see small oval-shaped eggs attached to the root of the hair, near the scalp. These are the nits.</p>

<p>You also need to look for live head lice as well as nits. If your child still has live lice, they’re still laying nits. And you won’t stop the nits and lice cycle until you get rid of the live lice.</p>

<p>Live head lice move fast. To spot live lice, you might have to part your child’s hair very quickly or use the wet-combing treatment described below.</p>

<p>If you think your child might have head lice, you should check for head lice in every member of your household.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about head lice or nits</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child is itching and scratching a lot and it interrupts her sleep</li>
	<li>sores develop on your child’s scalp</li>
	<li>your child has been treated three or more times in a year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Head lice treatment</h2>

<p>You should check all affected family members at the same time and treat them if they have lice. There are two ways to treat head lice – anti-lice hair products and wet-combing.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-lice lotions, liquids and creams</strong><br />
In most countries you  can get anti-lice products from your pharmacy without a prescription. <strong>It’s important to follow the instructions carefully</strong>.The main substance used is permethrin 1% that is approved for use on children aged 2 month and older.</p>

<p>Head lice are becoming resistant to the chemicals in these products, so it’s important to check that the lice are dead once you’ve used the treatment. If they aren’t dead, try using a product with a different active ingredient. The different active ingredients in these products include permethrin, malathion, spinosad or pyrethrin. Ask your doctor or your pharmacist if you’re not sure which product to try.</p>

<p>You’ll need to treat your child again about one week after the first lice treatment, to kill any eggs that have hatched and become mature lice since the first treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Wet-combing treatment</strong><br />
This head lice treatment involves combing wet hair with a special fine-toothed, metal lice comb and hair conditioner. You can buy these combs from your pharmacy, and any type of conditioner will do.</p>

<p>Here’s what to do:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Apply lots of conditioner to your child’s wet hair. Rub it into the scalp and along the hair shafts.</li>
	<li>Leave the conditioner on for at least 15 minutes. You might want to put a shower cap over your child’s head while you’re waiting. The conditioner suffocates the lice, and they release their claws from the hair shaft or scalp.</li>
	<li>Use the special lice comb to remove the conditioner from your child’s hair. Insert the comb until it gently touches the scalp and then brush down firmly. Clean the comb between strokes using a tissue or tap water. You’ll often be able to see how many lice you’ve combed out of your child’s hair.</li>
	<li>Comb your child’s entire head thoroughly at least twice.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Repeated wet-combing</strong> is a very good head lice treatment. Comb every 2-3 days for two weeks, until a full combing doesn’t show any eggs or lice on the entire scalp.</p>

<p>Wet-combing takes time, often more than 30 minutes. You can distract your child by discussing the day’s events, or letting your child read a book, play games on a mobile device, or watch the TV or a movie while you comb.</p>

<p>If your child has head lice, he doesn’t need to have a drastic haircut – this won’t treat or prevent lice.</p>

<h2>Prevention of head lice</h2>

<p>Lice can easily spread between children in the same class and also throughout your family.</p>

<p>If your child has head lice or nits, check your whole family. You should treat other family members if they complain of an itchy scalp and you find lice or nits. If they share a bed with the affected child, they should probably be treated regardless of symptoms.</p>

<p>Don’t let children share brushes or hats with each other.</p>

<p>Your child is unlikely to get head lice from things like furniture, pillows and carpet. But if someone in your family has head lice, you could consider washing any clothes or bedding the person has used in the last 48 hours. Use a hot wash cycle and dry things in a hot dryer. You could also vacuum carpets and furniture.</p>

<p>Let your child’s child care, preschool or school know that your child has lice. Keep your child at home until the day after appropriate treatment has commenced.</p>",8816,2,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"131, 136, 546, 551",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/head-lice"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/head-lice</a></p>",en,published
486,Childhood obesity,"Childhood obesity is when children have too much body fat. Overweight and obesity are health risks for children.
Help your child maintain a healthy weight by looking at your family’s lifestyle, including food choices, physical activity and screen time. If you’re worried your child might have a weight problem, see a doctor dietitian.","<h1>About childhood obesity</h1>

<p>Children with overweight and obesity are above their healthiest weight relative to their age and have too much body fat. Obesity is a more serious form of overweight.</p>

<p>Overweight and obesity happen when the energy children get from food and drinks is greater than the energy they use through daily activities.</p>

<p>Overweight and obesity are significant health issues for children. If you help children deal with these issues during childhood, they’re less likely to have problems with overweight and obesity later in life.</p>

<h2>Factors that influence healthy weight, overweight and obesity</h2>

<p>Many factors can put children at a higher risk of becoming overweight and obese. These factors include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>unhealthy food and drink choices</li>
	<li>lack of physical activity</li>
	<li>family role models</li>
	<li>family history and medical factors</li>
	<li>other factors like screen time and sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can help your child maintain a healthy weight by looking at these factors in your family’s lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Food and drink choices </strong></p>

<p>If you offer your child a range of healthy food, it will help your child grow and develop in a healthy way.</p>

<p>Healthy nutritious foods include vegetables, fruits, grains, reduced-fat dairy and protein-rich foods like lean meat, fish, chicken, eggs, peas, beans and lentils. For healthy development, your child needs to eat different amounts of these foods at different ages.</p>

<p>Tap water and reduced-fat milk are the healthiest drinks for children.</p>

<p><strong>Physical activity</strong></p>

<p>You can encourage your child to be physically active by walking when possible and playing outdoors.</p>

<p><strong>Family role models</strong><br />
your child is more likely to make healthy food choices and be active if she sees you eating healthily and being active. Young children do as you do, so modeling healthy eating and regular exercise can have a big impact.</p>

<p><strong>Family history and medical factors</strong></p>

<p>Some children are at greater risk of obesity because of genes that make them gain weight more easily, or because they have certain health problems.</p>

<p>In these cases it's even more important for your family to make healthy food and lifestyle choices.</p>

<p><strong>Other factors</strong></p>

<p>Another risk factor for childhood obesity is sleep problems. Children who don’t get enough sleep at night are more likely to become overweight or obese.</p>

<p>Getting your child into healthy fresh food and physical activity early in life can help reduce your child’s risk of overweight issues or obesity in the future.</p>

<h2>Why your child needs to maintain a healthy weight</h2>

<p>Maintaining <strong>healthy weight now</strong> reduces your child’s chances of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>being overweight or obese as an adult</li>
	<li>developing serious health disorders during childhood, including type-2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea and hip and joint problems</li>
	<li>suffering from emotional and social problems like teasing and bullying, low self-esteem, depression, poor body<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/healthy-lifestyle/body-image/body-image-teens""> </a>image.</li>
	<li>suffering physical health problems in adulthood, including heart disease, type-2 diabetes, some types of cancer, infertility and skin disorders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Worried about weight or childhood obesity: what to do</h2>

<p>Here are simple changes you can make to <strong>everyday family eating</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set a good example, and show your child that you enjoy healthy eating yourself.</li>
	<li>Involve your child in choosing and preparing healthy foods for meals. This helps children learn about healthy foods and making good choices. Children are also more likely to eat something they’ve helped to make.</li>
	<li>Eat more vegetables and salad. Aim to fill half the plate at main meals with salad or vegetables.</li>
	<li>Try to keep some foods and drinks out of the house. This includes fast food, potato chips, biscuits, cakes, lollies, flavoured milks and soft drinks. If you don’t have them at home, it’s harder for your child to eat them.</li>
	<li>Establish regular family<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/family-life/family-meals-cooking/family-meals-tips""> </a>meals, and sit down to enjoy meals together as a family – with the TV switched off as often as you can.</li>
	<li>Have healthy snacks handy for when you know your child will be hungry. For example, keep a bowl of fresh fruit on the bench and a container of chopped fresh vegies in the fridge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are simple changes you can make to get <strong>more physical activity</strong> into your family’s life:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure that your child balances screen time with other activities that are better for her health, like physical activity. Screen time includes TV, DVDs, computers, video games, mobiles phones and tablets.</li>
	<li>Give your child the chance for active play. Your child needs at least one hour of physical activity, which can be spread throughout the day. Physical activity during the school day usually isn’t enough.</li>
	<li>Build activity into everyday family life – for example, go for family walks or bike rides together.</li>
	<li>Walk to and from school, the local shops or friends’ places if possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone with overweight problems needs support to manage their weight. Your child can’t do it without you. If the whole family makes healthy food choices and gets active, it’s easier for your child to keep going with healthy lifestyle changes.</p>

<h2>Talking about healthy weight and childhood obesity</h2>

<p>Childhood obesity is a <strong>sensitive issue</strong>.</p>

<p>If your child does have an overweight problem, it’s better not to label him as overweight or obese. Instead you can talk about what your family needs to do to help your child get to a healthy weight.</p>

<p>Here are tips for talking with your child about overweight and obesity:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Focus on health and healthy lifestyle rather than weight loss.</li>
	<li>Try to use terms like ‘above a healthy weight’ rather than labels like ‘fat’, ‘good’, ‘bad’, ‘chunky’ or ‘obese’.</li>
	<li>Praise and encourage qualities that aren’t about the way your child looks. For example, ‘I like the way you handled that big school assignment’, ‘I feel proud when you look after the younger kids so well’ and ‘It’s great that you were calm before your talk’.</li>
	<li>Try to avoid saying things like ‘Don’t you think you should …’ or ‘You shouldn’t be having that’. Children might feel you’re nagging and could be less likely to do what you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>You can get advice and help from rhea doctor, dietitian, and if needed from psychologist.</p>",8351,1,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"131, 546, 136, 566, 571",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/nutrition-fitness/common-concerns/child-obesity"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/nutrition-fitness/common-concerns/child-obesity</a></p>",en,published

You should take your child to thre doctor if the pain does not go away quickly to make sure that there is no serious illness causing the pain.","<h1>About growing pains in children and teenagers</h1>

<p>Growing pains are very common, especially during the primary school years.</p>

<p>We don’t really know what causes growing pains – but they’re not caused by growing!</p>

<p>In most children with growing pains, nothing obvious brings them on.</p>

<p>One theory is that they’re related to exercise, but this isn’t always the case.</p>

<p>Some children with growing pains might also get stomach pain and headaches. For these children, growing pains might be related to stress or anxiety.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of growing pains</h2>

<p>If your child has growing pains, she might say she has an aching or a burning sensation in both legs – in the muscles of the thighs, calves or feet. The pains can also happen in the arms or other parts of the body, although this is much less common.</p>

<p>Growing pains usually happen at night and can sometimes wake your child. They’re also common in the daytime but are rarely bad enough to get in the way of daily activity.</p>

<p>In most children, the pain or discomfort tends to come and go. It’s hard to know when growing pains are going to happen.</p>

<p>A child with growing pains will usually let you massage the painful area. This can help you tell the difference between growing pains and a more serious condition. Children whose leg pains have a more serious cause won’t usually let anyone touch the painful area.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about growing pains?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> You can not tale if the pain is from growing pain or more serious disease such as infection, inflammation, or rarely tumor of tne bone or muscle.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, if the pain does not go away quickly you should take your child to the docor to make sure that there is no  serious condition.</strong> </p>

<p>Occasionally your GP might order an X-ray or blood test to make sure there’s no other cause for the pain, like a fracture or inflammation.</p>

<h2>Treatment for growing pains</h2>

<p>There’s no specific treatment for growing pains. Your child just needs you to tell him that the pains aren’t serious and they’ll go away.</p>

<p><strong>Massaging or placing a heat pack</strong> over the affected area might help. Muscle stretches before going to bed might also help. Occasionally your GP might suggest you give your child some mild pain relief like paracetamol.</p>

<p>There’s no need to stop your child from doing physical activity.</p>

<p>Growing pains usually sort themselves out over time.</p>

496,Febrile convulsions,"During a febrile convulsion, a child’s body will stiffen and jerk around. He’ll lose consciousness, and his eyes might roll backward. Symptoms don’t last long. If your child is having a convulsion, remove harmful objects nearby. If possible, video and time the convulsion. Call an ambulance if the convulsion lasts longer than five minutes or your child isn’t breathing. Start CPR if your child isn’t breathing. See your doctor or go to a hospital emergency department if it’s your child’s first convulsion or you’re worried about your child’s symptoms.","<h1>What is a febrile convulsion?</h1>

<p>A febrile convulsion is a seizure or fit that happens because of fever, which is a temperature higher than 38°C. The rapid rise in temperature causes an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Febrile convulsions usually happen in children between six months and six years old.</strong> Febrile convulsions that happes beyond this age range should be further investigated to make sure that there are other reasons such as infection or epilepsy.</p>

<p>It can be very frightening to see your child having a febrile convulsion, but children usually recover completely from febrile convulsions. Most febrile convulsions don’t cause long-term problems or brain damage either.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of febrile convulsions</h2>

<p>Symptoms of a febrile convulsion usually include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>body stiffness and/or jerky movements</li>
	<li>loss of consciousness (blacking out)</li>
	<li>eyes rolling back in the head</li>
	<li>shallow breathing or altered breathing</li>
	<li>deep sleep for an hour or so afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most febrile convulsions don’t last longer than a few minutes. Febrile convulsions almost always stop by themselves before you get the chance to seek medical treatment.</p>

<h2>What to do if you think your child is having a febrile convulsion</h2>

<p>Stay calm and remove any harmful objects so your child doesn’t injure himself.</p>

<p>Watch exactly what happens, so you can describe it later. If you have a smartphone or camera, take a video of the convulsion.</p>

<p>Time the febrile convulsion.</p>

<p>Once the convulsion has stopped, place your child on a soft surface, lying in the recovery position on her side to keep her airway open. Stay with her and give her reassurance.</p>

<p>Monitor your child’s breathing. If your child stops breathing, call an ambulance immediately and start CPR for babies or CPR for children over one year. Also ask for an ambulance if the febrile convulsion lasts longer than five minutes.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about febrile convulsions?</h2>

<p>Yes. Usually your child should see a doctor if she has a febrile convulsion. It is especially important to take your child to the doctor or go to a hospital emergency department if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>it’s your child’s first febrile convulsion</li>
	<li>you’re not sure whether your child has had a febrile convulsion</li>
	<li>your child has febrile convulsions often.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Children don’t usually need to be admitted to hospital</strong> after a febrile convulsion, unless your child is younger than 1 yr of age, or your doctor is concerned about the condition that caused the fever – for example, pneumonia or meningitis.</p>

<h2>Tests after a febrile convulsion</h2>

<p>A child who’s had a febrile convulsion probably won’t need tests.</p>

<p>Sometimes doctors might order blood or urine tests, or a chest X-ray, to work out what condition caused the fever.</p>

<p>Your child might be sent for an EEG if she’s having repeated febrile convulsions, but this won’t usually happen after a single febrile convulsion.</p>

<h2>Prevention of febrile convulsions</h2>

<p><strong>There’s no guaranteed way to prevent febrile convulsions.</strong></p>

<p>You can lower your child’s fever and make him more comfortable by using paracetamol or ibuprofen and taking off extra clothing. Sometimes a febrile convulsion will be the first sign of a fever. </p>

<p>In most cases, treatment with anticonvulsant medication.to prevent future seizures is not recommended.</p>

<h2>More about febrile convulsions</h2>

<p>Children generally only ever have one febrile convulsion. However about 30 to 35 percent of children who have a febrile seizure will have another febrile seizure. .</p>

<p>About 3 in every 100 children will have a febrile convulsion.</p>

<p>Febrile convulsions tend to run in families and affect boys more than girls.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is when a child has or is at risk of having repeated and unpredictable seizures. Most healthy children who’ve had a febrile do not develop epilepsy later. The risk that a child will develop epilepsy after a single, simple febrile seizure is only slightly higher than that of a child who never has a febrile seizure.</p>",8806,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"581, 306",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/febrile-convulsions"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/febrile-convulsions</a></p>",en,published
501,Headache,"Children often get headaches, and some get headaches that keep coming back. You usually don’t need to worry about headaches. But see your doctot if you’re concerned, especially if your child develops a sudden, severe headache that hurts most when she wakes up, or that wakes her up.","<h2>Causes of headaches</h2>

<p>In children, headaches can be caused by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>infectious illnesses – for example, sinusitis, colds or flu</li>
	<li>tense muscles because of anxiety, tiredness or teeth-grinding during sleep</li>
	<li>visual problems – for example, eye strain</li>
	<li>a head injury</li>
	<li>migraine</li>
	<li>medications – for example, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids and antidepressants.</li>
</ul>

<p>Younger children tend less than adults to get tense muscles and migraine, although these problems are the most common causes of headaches in teenagers.</p>

<p>Not drinking enough fluids, not getting enough sleep and too much caffeine can cause headaches or make them worse. This is especially the case with busy, active school-age children in the summer months.</p>

<p>Headaches can also be linked with meningitis, brain tumours or bleeding in the brain, but these illnesses are rare.</p>

<h2>Headache symptoms</h2>

<p>Some headaches are mild enough for children to continue with their normal activities. But sometimes a headache can make a child feel really sick – your child might even need bed rest.</p>

<p>Pain from a headache can be sharp or dull, on one side of the head, or over the entire head and neck. The headache might feel like a pounding sensation, or just tightness in the muscles.</p>

<p>Migraines in young and adolescent children can have symptoms like throbbing pain on one or both sides, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and sometimes an ‘aura’ before the headache starts.</p>

<p>A migraine aura affects sight or hearing. Your child might see wavering lights around objects or have ringing in his ears. He might also dislike bright lights and loud noises or want to sleep regardless of the time of day.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about a headache</h2>

<p><strong>You should take your child to the doctor immediately if your child:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>wakes up because of a headache</li>
	<li>has also nausea and vomiting in addition to headache</li>
	<li>develops sudden, severe headaches that are most painful when she wakes up, and that come with nausea or vomiting</li>
	<li>has a headache that keeps coming back</li>
	<li>has a headache that starts to disrupt her home, school or social life</li>
	<li>doesn’t get better with the treatments described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child also needs to see a doctor immediately if he has a headache and any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a high temperature</li>
	<li>seizures</li>
	<li>confusion or drowsiness</li>
	<li>blurred vision</li>
	<li>unsteadiness when walking</li>
	<li>stiff neck</li>
	<li>a head injury including concussion</li>
	<li>an unusual rash.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests related to headache</h2>

<p>Common headaches don’t usually need special or specific tests. Your doctor will usually be able to make a diagnosis after talking with you and your child and doing a physical examination that includes looking at your child’s nerves, muscles and eyes.</p>

<p>If your doctor is concerned that your child’s headache might have a more serious cause, the doctot  might refer your child to for eye exam or to a paediatric neurologist. Very occasionally, your child might need a CT scan or MRI scan.</p>

<h2>Treatment for headache</h2>

<p>Treatment for uncomplicated headaches usually involves keeping your child quiet – for example, lying down in a darkened room.</p>

<p>You can try massaging the area affected by muscle tension.</p>

<p>Quite often, distracting your child with a quiet game will take her attention away from the pain.</p>

<p>If pain goes on, you can safely give paracetamol or ibuprofen according to the directions. Your child shouldn’t need to take pain medication too often. If this happens, you should talk to your doctor.</p>

<p>If your child’s headaches seem to be related to stress, try to work out what’s causing your child’s stress. You can then help your child avoid the things that make him feel stressed.</p>

<p>If your child has migraines that keep coming back, your doctor can recommend a plan to prevent and treat migraine headaches.</p>

506,Epilepsy and seizures,"When a child has recurrent seizures or fits, the condition is called epilepsy. If your child is diagnosed with epilepsy, treatment might involve anticonvulsant medication. Epilepsy treatment aims to let children live a normal life.","<h1>What is epilepsy?</h1>

<p>Epilepsy is a condition that affects the brain, causing seizures.</p>

<p>If your child has been diagnosed with epilepsy it means they’ve had at least one seizure and are likely to have more . It is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can change a child’s awareness, behaviour, body movements.</p>

<p>If a child has one seizure, it doesn’t always mean she has epilepsy. Most children who have a single seizure don’t go on to have any more. Epilepsy isn’t usually diagnosed until after two or more seizures.</p>

<h2>What causes epilepsy?</h2>

<p>There are some things that make a child more likely to have epileptic seizures. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>history of epilepsy in immediate family members</li>
	<li>Genetic, behavioural  and  structural changes in the</li>
	<li>brain injury </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Simple febrile convulsions are not considered as epilepsy, </strong>however, children with febrile convulsions that last longer than 15 minutes or happen many times have higher risk for epilepsy..</p>

<p>Seizures in children at risk of epilepsy might be triggered by flashing lights or by looking at patterns on a TV or cinema screen.</p>

<p>In about half of all children with epilepsy, we don’t know what causes the condition.</p>

<h2>Types of epilepsy</h2>

<p>Children with epilepsy might have many different types of seizures:  The type of seizure depends on where the abnormal electrical activity in the brain comes from.</p>

<p>There are two main groups of seizures – focal seizures and generalised seizures.</p>

<p><strong>Focal seizures</strong> that starts in only part of the brain and therefore, only part of the body is involved.</p>

<p><strong>Generalised seizures</strong> that involve the whole brain.</p>

<p> <br />
Seizures may cause the muscles to get stiff or floppy and or may cause arms and legs jerks.</p>

<p>Some seizures may cause drooling and wetting to the child.<br />
Another form of seizurs are absence seizures when children might look like they’re briefly staring into space and seem unaware of what’s going on around them.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Management of epileptic seizures</h2>

<p>If you think your child is having a seizure and has lost consciousness, it’s important that you stay calm and remove any harmful objects so she doesn’t injure herself.</p>

<p>Place your child on a soft surface, lying in the recovery position on his side. Stay with him and give him reassurance.</p>

<p>If it’s your child’s first seizure, watch exactly what happens, so you can describe it later. If you have a smartphone or camera, take a video of the seizure.</p>

<p>Time the seizure.</p>

<p>Once the seizure has stopped, place your child on a soft surface, lying in the recovery position on her side to keep her airway open.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about epileptic seizures</h2>

<p>It’s important for your child to see a doctor or go to a hospital emergency department if:</p>

<p>• it’s your child’s first seizure</p>

<p>• your child has several or repeated seizures</p>

<p>• you’re not sure whether your child has had a seizure</p>

<p>• your child starts having seizures more often than is usual for him.</p>

<p>Ask for an ambulance if a seizure lasts longer than 2-3 minutes.</p>

<h2>Tests for epilepsy</h2>

<p>If your GP thinks your child might have epilepsy, the doctor will usually refer your child to a paediatric neurologist for further investigation.</p>

<p>The doctor will order blood tests and an EEG. Your doctor might also organise a CT scan<strong> </strong>or MRI scan of the brain.</p>

<h2>Treatment for epilepsy</h2>

<p>If your doctor prescribes anticonvulsant medication for your child, <strong>the aim is to let your child have a normal life</strong>. But this medication might have some side effects. If your child is taking anticonvulsant medication, she’ll need to see a doctor regularly.</p>

<p>If medication doesn’t work, your doctor might talk with you about other therapies, including a ketogenic diet or surgical options.</p>

<p>You should tell everyone involved in your child’s daily care – for example, child care staff and teachers – that your child has epilepsy. They need to understand what this means, as well as how to handle a seizure if it happens. Encourage your child to wear a wrist bracelet or pendant that lets people know he has epilepsy.</p>

<h2>Prevention of epileptic seizures</h2>

<p>Regular meals, adequate sleep and exercise might help to reduce the risk of seizures.</p>

<p>Your child should avoid things that she knows trigger her seizures, like flashing lights, overtiredness, hunger or television.</p>

<p>Always supervise your child when he’s swimming, bathing or doing <a>activities</a>  that involve heights such as cycling, climbing etc</p>

<p>Watching your child having a seizure can be very distressing. Contacting an epilepsy support group might help you feel less fearful about your child’s condition.</p>",9081,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"591, 596, 306, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/epilepsy-seizures"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/epilepsy-seizures</a></p>",en,published
511,Cleft lip and cleft palate,"Cleft lip and cleft palate is when the lip or the roof of the mouth doesn’t close over properly. Babies with cleft lip and palate need surgery and specialist follow-up. Babies and children might need help with feeding, speech therapy and special dental care.","<h1>About cleft lip and cleft palate</h1>

<p>A cleft lip or cleft palate is when the lip or the roof of the mouth doesn’t close over properly. This forms a cleft, or open space, in the lip or mouth. Cleft lip and cleft palate can happen separately or happen together. Cleft lip alone is more common.</p>

<p>Cleft lip and cleft palate are congenital defects – this means they happen during the development of the fetus and are present at birth.</p>

<p>We don’t know exactly what causes cleft lip and cleft palate. Genetic influences are believed to be largely responsible, although often there’s no family history of the condition. </p>

<p>There are some evidences that  smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy, having diagnosed with diabetes before pregnancy and also being obese during pregnancy may increase the  risk of having a baby with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.</p>

<p><strong>Remember, having a baby born with a cleft can be upsetting, but cleft lip and cleft palate can be corrected.</strong></p>

<h2>Symptoms of cleft lip and cleft palate</h2>

<p>Cleft lips and/or cleft palates vary in severity. They can range from a small notch in the upper lip, to a gaping defect of the lip and palate.</p>

<p>With a cleft palate, the hole in the roof of the mouth means there’s an abnormal connection between the mouth and the nose.</p>

<h2>Other problems associated with cleft lip and cleft palate</h2>

<p>Babies with cleft palate might have <strong>significant trouble feeding</strong>. This is because they find it difficult or impossible to suck, even though they have no problems swallowing.</p>

<p>Babies with a cleft palate might frequent ear infections with risk of hearing impairment. </p>

<p>Children who have cleft lip and palate might also have <strong>problems with teeth and gums</strong>. For example, they might have missing teeth, extra teeth or teeth coming out the wrong place or in an abnormal direction. This can affect baby teeth and/or adult teeth.</p>

<p>Cleft lip and cleft palate might cause nsal speaking voice and might also affect the way children’s noses look.</p>

<h2>Treatment for cleft lip and cleft palate</h2>

<p>Treatment for cleft lips and/or cleft palates depends on their severity.</p>

<p>Initially babies need to be fed with a special spout, or elongated teat. This sends milk to the back of the throat.</p>

<p><strong>Surgery is always necessary</strong>, and the type, extent and number of operations depend on the severity of the cleft lip or cleft palate. A cleft lip is usually repaired at 3-6 months of age, and a cleft palate at around 9-12 months of age, before children start to speak. After surgery, cleft lips usually look much better.</p>

<p>After surgery, children with cleft lip or cleft palate need regular <strong>follow-up visits with specialist teams</strong>. This is to check how they’re growing and how they look, speak and hear. These follow-up checks help doctors decide whether children need more surgery.</p>

<p>Children with cleft lip and palate often need <strong>other therapy</strong>. For example, children with cleft palate need speech therapy to learn to speak normally. Children might also need specialised dental care to fix teeth problems.</p>

<h2>Prevention of cleft lip and cleft palate</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Consider genetic counseling.</strong> Especially If you have a family history of cleft lip and cleft palate.</li>
	<li><strong>Take prenatal vitamins.</strong> If you're planning to get pregnant soon, ask your doctor if you should take prenatal vitamins.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't use tobacco or alcohol.</strong> Use of alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with a birth defect.</li>
	<li><strong>Ensure a healthy weight gain during pregnancy.</strong></li>

516,Hip: developmental dysplasia (DDH),"Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is when the ball of a baby’s hip doesn’t sit properly in the hip socket. This means the hip is unstable. Health professionals will check your baby for DDH at birth and throughout your baby’s first year.
Babies with DDH might need a brace. More severe cases might need surgery.","<h1>About developmental dysplasia of the hip or DDH</h1>

<p>It happens when the ball of a baby’s hip isn’t sitting in the right position in the hip socket. This can cause the hip to become loose and unstable. It can even cause dislocation, which is when the ball comes partially or completely out of the socket.</p>

<p>Usually, only one hip is affected, most commonly the left hip. But sometimes both hips are affected.</p>

<p>DDH can happen at birth or develop in the weeks or months after birth.</p>

<p>DDH can vary from mild to severe. It isn’t painful.</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms of DDH</h2>

<p>If your baby or young child has developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), you might see the following signs, but they won’t always be obvious:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One of your baby’s legs looks shorter. This is noticeable when your baby is on her back and her hips and knees are bent at a 90° angle.</li>
	<li>Your baby’s legs are tight when you try to open them to change his nappy.</li>
	<li>Your baby has uneven thigh creases.</li>
	<li>Your child limps as she gets older.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about DDH?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to your doctor if you notice any of the signs of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) above.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Tests for DDH</h2>

<p>Doctors do a very careful physical examination of both hips in all newborn babies in the first few days of life.</p>

<p>Your doctor will do these examinations again at six weeks, and will check your baby’s hips periodically during the first 12 months of your baby’s life.</p>

<p>If your health professional suspects developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), your baby might get a hip ultrasound.</p>

<p>If you have a family history of DDH or your baby was breech, a hip ultrasound might be recommended at 6-8 weeks of age.</p>

<p>You might be referred to a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon for a specialist opinion.</p>

<h2>Treatment for DDH</h2>

<p>If your baby is diagnosed with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) when he’s a newborn or young baby, doctors might recommend a brace. Babies with braces usually have hip ultrasounds every 4-6 weeks to monitor their progress.</p>

<p>For mild and moderate DDH, children generally wear braces for three months. For more severe DDH, babies wear braces for six months or longer. Babies with more severe DDH might need surgery too.</p>

<p>The earlier DDH is diagnosed and bracing is started, the better. If babies are older than five months of age when diagnosed with DDH, they are more likely to get complications and need more complex treatment like surgery.</p>

<h2>DDH prevention</h2>

<p>DDH can sometimes be caused by wrapping your baby’s legs too tightly, so they’re straight and can’t move.<strong> If you wrap your baby, keep her legs loose</strong> so that her hips and knees can bend.</p>

<p>Some babies really like to lie with their head turned to one side. This can affect the position of your baby’s hips. It’s important to alternate your baby’s head position for sleep from right to left. This can also help prevent your baby from getting an uneven or flattened head.</p>

<h2>Risk factors for DDH</h2>

<p>Risk factors for DDH include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a strong family history of DDH</li>
	<li>breech position in the womb – that is, baby is head up and bottom or feet down</li>
	<li>low amniotic fluid in the womb</li>
	<li>twin pregnancy</li>
	<li>gender – DDH is <strong>four times more common in girls</strong> than boys.</li>

521,Clubfoot,"Clubfoot is when a baby’s foot points downwards and inwards. Babies with clubfoot need treatment within two weeks of age.
Clubfoot treatment involves plaster casts, surgery and bracing.","<h1>About clubfoot</h1>

<p>Clubfoot is a structural problem with the foot. In a baby with clubfoot, the foot is twisted out of its normal position. The foot can’t be moved into a normal position.</p>

<p>Clubfoot happens in approximately 1 in 1000 births. Clubfoot can affect one or both feet.</p>

<p>Its medical name is congenital talipes equinovarus.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Clubfoot symptoms</h2>

<p>If your baby has clubfoot, his foot points downwards and inwards like a golf club. The middle section of your baby’s foot also twists inwards, which makes the foot look short and wide.</p>

<p>There are usually deep creases on the inside of the foot and back of the heel.</p>

<p>Your baby might also have poorly developed calf muscles.</p>

<p>Positional talipes is a condition that’s similar to clubfoot. But with positional talipes, the foot can be gently moved into a normal position. It’s milder than clubfoot and usually fixes itself without treatment.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis of clubfoot</h2>

<p>Clubfoot can be diagnosed at the 20-week ultrasound scan, which is a standard test in pregnancy.</p>

<p>Sometimes a midwife or paediatrician will diagnose clubfoot when a baby is born.</p>

<p>If your baby is diagnosed with clubfoot, you’ll see a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon.</p>

<p>Sometimes children with clubfoot also have developmental dysplasia of the hip. When babies are born, the doctors always check their hips carefully and if the doctor is concerned that your baby has developmental dysplasia of the hip, he will  refer your baby for a hip ultrasound.</p>

<h2>Treatment for clubfoot</h2>

<p>Treatment for clubfoot usually begins shortly, ideally within a week or two after birth. It involves using plaster casts to gradually put the foot back into its correct position. The plaster casts are changed weekly for 6-8 weeks.</p>

<p>Babies then need to have a procedure to lengthen their Achilles tendons, followed by another plaster cast for 2-3 weeks.</p>

<p>After the plaster cast treatment is finished, babies wear a brace to hold feet in the correct position. This part of the treatment goes on until children are around four years old.</p>

<p>Careful follow-up is essential, because the condition might come back.</p>

<p>With early specialist treatment, most children born with clubfoot will go on to crawl, walk and run at similar ages to other children. They can usually wear normal shoes, lead active lives and take part in sports.</p>

<h2>Causes of clubfoot</h2>

<p>Clubfoot is a congenital condition. This means it’s present at birth. It happens when a baby’s foot and leg muscles, ligaments and tendons don’t develop properly while the baby is in the womb.</p>

<p>Clubfoot is thought to be a genetic condition. It happens twice as often in boys than girls. Sometimes clubfoot happens along with other conditions like trisomy 18, spina bifida and cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of clubfoot in babies.</p>

<p>Another cause is not enough amniotic fluid during pregnancy: Too little of the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb may increase the risk of clubfoot.</p>

526,Labial fusion or adhesions,"Labial fusion is when the skin of the vulva’s inner lips joins together. Labial fusion usually isn’t painful but can lead to dribbling after weeing. If your daughter has labial fusion in early childhood, it’ll probably go away by itself by puberty.","<h1>About labial fusion</h1>

<p>Your daughter’s external genitals are called the vulva. The vulva has inner lips (labia minora) and outer lips (labia majora). The labia cover your daughter’s vaginal opening.</p>

<p>Labial fusion is when the skin of the inner lips joins together. This changes the way this part of your daughter’s body looks, and it can sometimes mean that the opening for wee gets smaller.</p>

<p>Young girls between six months and two years old tend to get labial fusion more than older girls, but it can happen in older girls too.</p>

<p>Labial fusion is also sometimes called fused labia or labial adhesions.</p>

<p>Although some babies with ambiguous genitalia have fused labia,<strong> this article doesn’t cover ambiguous genitalia</strong>.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of labial fusion</h2>

<p>Labial fusion usually <strong>doesn’t cause any issues or pain</strong> for young girls.</p>

<p>Sometimes, young girls with labial fusion might dribble after they wee, because wee gets trapped behind the skin that is joined together. This can lead to wee leaking onto the girl’s underwear or difficulties with toilet training.</p>

<p>Girls also sometimes have vulvovaginitis.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about symptoms of labial fusion</h2>

<p>There’s usually no need for your daughter to see a doctor about labial fusion unless:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your daughter experiences frequent symptoms of vulvovaginitis, like a red or sore vulva</li>
	<li>you’re generally worried about her labial fusion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Labial fusion doesn’t affect your daughter’s fertility, sexual function or menstruation.</p>

<h2>Treatment for labial fusion</h2>

<p>If your daughter has labial fusion, she probably won’t need treatment. <strong>The condition is likely to sort itself out by the time she reaches puberty.</strong></p>

<p>Good toilet habits can help with dribbling after weeing. Encourage your daughter to wriggle around for five seconds after a wee to make sure all the trapped wee comes out. Treatment with application of estrogen ointment is rarely needed and it is used only when the fusion is causing too much irritation.</p>

<h2>Causes of labial fusion</h2>

<p>We don’t really know what causes labial fusion. A decreased concentration of thr hormone estrogen may play a role.</p>",8586,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",41,60,"661, 666, 131, 671",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/fused-labia"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/fused-labia</a></p>",en,published

<p>Mouth ulcers are little sores that come up inside the mouth, on the tongue or on the gums.</p>

<p>Several things can cause mouth ulcers:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>viral infections like cold sores or hand, foot and mouth disease</li>
	<li>oral thrush</li>
	<li>injuries like biting, burns or rubbing from braces</li>
	<li>low vitamin levels</li>
	<li>diseases like coeliac<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/coeliac-disease""> </a>disease or inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
	<li>Very rarely these ulcers are sign of low number of white blood cells (called leukocytes). </li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes ulcers keep coming back without any obvious cause.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of mouth ulcers</h2>

<p>Mouth ulcers usually look like round, white sores on the inner lining of your child’s mouth, or on the surface of your child’s gums or tongue.</p>

<p>These sores can be painful, especially when your child eats salty or spicy foods. Sometimes your child might even refuse food until the ulcers start to heal.</p>

<p>If an infection is causing the ulcers, your child might also have a fever.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about mouth ulcers?</h2>

<p>If you think your child might have ulcers related to a mouth infection, it’s a good idea to see your doctor.</p>

<p>You should see your doctor urgently if your child develops severe mouth ulcers with symptoms of general illness like:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>weight loss</li>
	<li>stomach pain</li>
	<li>unexplained fevers</li>
	<li>blood or mucus in poo</li>
	<li>neck stiffness and tiredness</li>
	<li>ulcers around the anus.</li>
	<li>When mouth ulcers are seen in babies younger than 3 months of age.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

<h2>Treatment for mouth ulcers</h2>

<p>Simple mouth ulcers usually don’t need treatment and will clear up within a week.</p>

<p>If your child is in pain, you can try applying an anaesthetic mouth gel to the area. You can buy these mouth gels over the counter from pharmacies. You can also try warm salt water rinses if your child is old enough to rinse or gargle with liquids.</p>

<p>Encourage your child to have enough fluids by offering small, frequent sips of water. This will help to prevent dehydration.</p>

<p>There are specific treatments for mouth infections caused by thrush and the cold sore virus. Your doctor will let you know about these if your child needs them.</p>",8796,2,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"676, 681, 131, 306, 686",,1,0,,en,published

Paracetamol and mouth gel or wash can help. Treatment with acyclovir is used for severe cases and high rosk pchildren. See your doctor if your child has trouble drinking and eating, or has symptoms of dehydration.","<h1>About herpes simplex mouth infection</h1>

<p>When a child is infected with herpes simplex virus for the first time, it can cause herpes simplex mouth infection. This infection often leads to painful gums and ulcers inside a child’s mouth. This is called <strong>gingivostomatitis.</strong></p>

<p>After a first infection with herpes simplex virus, the virus sleeps inside nerve cells. It can wake up and cause cold<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cold-sores""> </a>sores when your immune system is under stress – for example, during a minor illness, hormonal changes or sunburn.</p>

<p>The virus can also flare up in older girls when they have their periods.</p>

<p>Herpes simplex virus is <strong>highly contagious</strong> and can spread even before blisters form.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of herpes simplex mouth infection</h2>

<p>Your child might say he has a sore mouth. His lips, gums and throat might also be sore.</p>

<p>The lining of your child’s mouth might be swollen and red, and you might be able to see lots of tiny blisters or ulcers.</p>

<p>Younger children might refuse food or drink, and drool a lot. Your child might be irritable and cry a lot. She might also have a fever and swollen lymph glands.</p>

<p>Symptoms <strong>usually start clearing up within 3-4 days</strong> and disappear completely in 7-10 days without leaving any scarring.</p>

<h2>Complications of herpes simplex mouth infection</h2>

<p>The major complication of a herpes simplex virus mouth infection is poor fluid intake and dehydration. This is because gingivostomatitis makes swallowing painful and difficult.Sometimes the sores in mouth might be infected by bacteria.</p>

<p>Symptoms of dehydration include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>little or no urine</li>
	<li>paleness</li>
	<li>sunken eyes</li>
	<li>cold hands and feet</li>
	<li>drowsiness</li>
	<li>crankiness.</li>
</ul>

<p>In very rare cases, herpes simplex virus can cause encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain tissue. This can cause behavioural changes, drowsiness and seizures.</p>

<p>Children with a <strong>weakened immune system</strong> because of illness or medication have an increased risk of getting herpes simplex mouth infection and encephalitis. Babies less than three months old are also at increased risk and should be seen immediately by the doctor.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about herpes simplex mouth infection?</h2>

<p>If you’re concerned that your child is dehydrated, you should go straight to your GP or nearest emergency department. You should also seek help if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is generally unwell</li>
	<li>refuses food and liquids</li>
	<li>passes urine less often than usual</li>
	<li>is confused, drowsy or behaving in a concerning way</li>
	<li>doesn’t get better after a few days.</li>
	<li>If the child is younger than 3 months or has weakened immune system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment for herpes simplex mouth infection</h2>

<p>You can give your child paracetamol or  ibuprofen in recommended doses to help ease your child’s pain.</p>

<p>You can also use <strong>topical pain preparations directly in your child’s mouth</strong> to relieve pain. These preparations include lignocaine gel 2% or lignocaine and chlorhexidine mouth wash (for older children who won’t swallow).</p>

<p>You should encourage your child to drink fluids, even tiny amounts at a time. One option is oral rehydration solution like Gastrolyte® or Hydralyte™, which you can get as liquid or ice blocks from your pharmacy.</p>

<p>If your child is used to a bottle, it might be easier to feed him using a cup and spoon until the infection improves. If your child is refusing food, try offering him very soft foods.</p>

<p>If the infection is severe or your child is at risk of a severe infection, your doctor might suggest an anti-viral medication like aciclovir.</p>

<h2>Prevention of herpes simplex mouth infection</h2>

<p>If someone in your family has a herpes simplex mouth infection, other family members should avoid direct contact with any blisters.

Slapped cheek disease isn’t serious for most children, although it can be dangerous for unborn babies. There’s no need to keep your child home from child care, preschool or school.","<h1>About slapped cheek disease or fifth disease</h1>

<p>Slapped cheek disease is a mild viral infection caused by parvovirus B19. This virus is spread through personal contact or through coughing and sneezing.</p>

<p>Outbreaks generally happen in early spring.</p>

<p>Slapped cheek disease most commonly affects children aged 5-15 years.</p>

<p>Slapped cheek disease is also called fifth disease.</p>

<h2>Slapped cheek disease symptoms</h2>

<p>The parvovirus that causes slapped cheek disease usually infects children around two weeks before any symptoms appear.</p>

<p>The illness starts with fever, headache and a runny nose.</p>

<p>Once these symptoms start to ease, a <strong>distinctive red rash </strong>comes up on the face. It makes children look like their cheeks have been slapped. The rash then spreads to the chest, tummy, back, arms and legs, but not the palms and soles. The rash isn’t usually itchy.</p>

<p>At first the rash looks blotchy, but as the centre clears, it starts to look lacy.</p>

<p>By the time the rash has appeared, your child is usually no longer sick and is not contagious. It might take 1-3 weeks for the rash to clear entirely. Overheating, exercise or sunlight can make the rash look worse. The rash might come and go for a while. </p>

<p>Other symptoms of slapped cheek disease can include red eyes, swollen<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/swollen-lymph-nodes""> </a>glands, sore throat and diarrhoea.</p>

<p>Older children might complain of joint swelling or pain too.</p>

<p><strong>Some children are at higher risk of complications</strong> from slapped cheek disease. They include children who have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>red blood cell problems like severe anaemia</li>
	<li>a weakened immune system because of a medical condition or medical treatment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Parvovirus is most contagious two weeks before symptoms appear. Your child isn’t usually contagious once the rash has appeared.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about slapped cheek disease?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the GP if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child develops a rash and you’re not sure what’s causing it especially when the rash doesn’t temporarily disappear with pressure</li>
	<li>your child’s fever doesn’t settle after 48 hours</li>

	<li>your child develops a rash and has red blood cell problems or a weakened immune system</li>
	<li>you’re worried your child is unwell.</li>

Drinking lots of fluid is important. Keep your child at home until the blisters have dried up.","<h1>About hand, foot and mouth disease</h1>

<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease is a mild infection that causes mouth ulcers and blisters on the hands and feet. It’s caused by viruses from a group of viruses called entroviruses.</p>

<p>Because hand, foot and mouth disease can be caused by different viruses, children can get hand, foot and mouth disease more than once.</p>

<p>Outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease typically happen in summer and autumn.</p>

<p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease is often confused with foot-and-mouth disease of animals (also called hoof-and-mouth disease), which affects cows, sheep, and pigs.</p>

<p>Humans do not get the animal disease, and animals do not get the human disease.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>How hand, foot and mouth disease spreads</h2>

<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease is contagious among groups of children, especially preschoolers. It’s spread mainly through touching the fluid inside blisters. The virus is also in the poo of infected children.</p>

<p>A child with hand, foot and mouth disease is very infectious until the blisters are dried up. </p>

<h2>Symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>

<p>The virus infects children 4-6 days before symptoms appear.</p>

<p>Your child might have a mild fever for a day or two before the other symptoms appear.</p>

<p>Small mouth ulcers usually appear first on the cheeks, gums and sides of the tongue. Your child might also complain of a sore mouth or throat, or just go off her food and refuse fluids.</p>

<p>Your child might also have a headache and aching muscles, mild stomach pain or nausea.</p>

<p>Small blisters also appear on the hands and feet, usually on the palms and soles. Tiny red spots might appear on your child’s bottom. </p>

<p>The blisters and ulcers usually go away after 7-10 days.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about hand, foot and mouth disease?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if you think he might have hand, foot and mouth disease, or you’re not sure why he has a rash.</p>

<p>You should also take your child to the doctor or to a hospital emergency department if she:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is refusing fluids as well as solids</li>
	<li>is showing signs of dehydration – not as much wee as usual, paleness, weight loss, sunken eyes, cold hands and feet, and drowsiness</li>
	<li>is very sleepy or generally unwell</li>
	<li>has a headache, stiff neck or back pain</li>
	<li>has trouble walking or is dizzy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>

<p>There’s <strong>no therapy</strong> for hand, foot and mouth disease. But most children get better quickly by themselves without any problems.</p>

<p>Paracetamol or ibuprofen can help ease discomfort and pain.</p>

<p>It’s important for your child to drink fluids to avoid dehydration. This can be hard if your child’s mouth is sore. You could try an oral rehydration solution, which you can buy from any pharmacy.</p>

<p>If eating hurts your child, it’s best for him to stick to soft foods for several days, and to avoid tangy foods like tomatoes, lemons, grapefruit and oranges.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t try to pop the blisters.</strong> This increases the risk of getting a skin infection and spreading the virus to other children.</p>

<h2>Prevention of hand, foot and mouth disease</h2>

<p><strong>Careful handwashing, </strong>especially at child care and preschool, and after chanfing diappers is the main measure that can help minimising the spread of the virus.</p>

551,Impetigo,"Impetigo happens when sores on your child’s skin get infected by common bacteria. The sores are very contagious and can be crusted, weeping, blistered or filled with pus. Your child needs to see a GP to get antibiotic treatment. Impetigo is also called school sores.","<h1>Causes of impetigo or school sores</h1>

<p>Impetigo or school sores develop when a common bacteria (usually  <em>Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus group A</em> ) gets into a cut, scratch or sore on your child’s skin. Because the skin is broken, it can’t act as a barrier against the bacteria.</p>

<p> The bacteria can spread if other parts of the body come into contact with the original sore. This can cause more impetigo sores to develop.</p>

<p><strong>Impetigo is highly contagious. It’s quite common for there to be outbreaks in schools and child care centres.</strong></p>

<p>Impetigo often occurs on top of other skin problems like eczema, scabies, insect bites or chickenpox.</p>

<p>Impetigo is more common in the warmer months.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of impetigo or school sores</h2>

<p>In the early stages of impetigo, all you might notice are flat red spots or small blisters on any part of your child’s body. These spots are especially common around the face (particularly the mouth and nose), hands and legs.</p>

<p>The spots might fill up with yellow or green pus, burst or crust over. The bacteria are in the liquid and crusts of the sores. If you don’t treat the sores, they might get bigger and more of them might grow.</p>

<p>Impetigo can be itchy or tender.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about impetigo or school sores</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a sore on your child’s body is surrounded by an area of red skin</li>
	<li>your child has a crusted or weeping sore, especially if the sore is getting larger or spreading</li>
	<li>your child is also generally unwell or has a fever</li>
	<li>you think your child has impetigo.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for impetigo or school sores</h2>

<p>Most time no tests ate neded and your doctor may identy the infection by looking at the sore/s. In some cases the doctor might take a swab of the infected sores and send it for culture to identify the bacteria causing the impetigo infection and the antibiotic that will work best against it.</p>

<h2>Treatment of impetigo or school sores</h2>

<p>If the impetigo sores are small and aren’t blistering, apply an antibiotic cream and be extra careful about skin hygiene and handwashing. This can prevent the sores from spreading and allow them to heal.</p>

<p>But most cases of impetigo need a prescribed medication like an antibiotic ointment, tablet or liquid.</p>

<p>In between putting the ointment on the infected spots, gently wash your child’s skin with soap or an antibacterial solution, then pat dry.</p>

<p>You can remove the crusts from your child’s skin by getting him to soak in the bath for 20-30 minutes to soften the scabs. You can then gently wipe away the crust with a towel.</p>

<h2>Prevention of impetigo or school sores</h2>

<p>Impetigo can spread rapidly to other parts of the body if your child touches the sore and then scratches somewhere else. Explain this to your child, and encourage her not to pick at the sores.</p>

<p>Keep your child’s fingernails short and make sure he washes his hands often, until the infection has cleared up.</p>

<p>Impetigo is highly contagious. Keep your child home from child care, preschool or school.  After your child starts antibiotic treatment, wait at least 24 hours before sending her back to child care, preschool or school and make sure to cover all wet sores with watertight dressings. .</p>",8856,2,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"721, 726, 731, 736, 306",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/impetigo"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/impetigo</a></p>",en,published

<p>Heat rash or prickly heat happens because your child’s sweat glands aren’t fully developed. They can get blocked if she gets too hot. When this happens, sweat can get trapped under the skin and form small lumps or blisters.</p>

<p>This is why newborn babies often get heat rash in summer or in hot, humid climates. It might also appear if your child is overdressed.</p>

<p>Heat rash is common in babies, but <strong>can also happen in older children</strong>.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of heat rash or prickly heat</h2>

<p>Very small pinkish-red or clear blisters appear over your child’s face, neck and in the skin folds, especially in the nappy area.</p>

</ul>

<p>Not every rash is just a heat rash. Check with your doctor if you’re in any doubt or are worried.</p>

<h2>Treatment for heat rash or prickly heat</h2>

<p>You can usually treat heat rash or prickly heat by <strong>making sure your child stays cool and avoids getting sweaty</strong>. You can do this by using air-conditioning if you live in a hot climate and avoiding too many layers when you dress your child. Dressing him in light cotton clothing is also a good idea.</p>

<p>If you wrap your baby, make sure she doesn’t get too warm.</p>

<p>To <strong>help your child feel more comfortable</strong>, you can give him a bath in lukewarm water. It’s best to avoid soap, because this can irritate your child’s skin. You can also put calamine lotion on the rash.</p>

<p>The rash should disappear in 2-3 days, but can take longer than this.</p>

<p>If your child is scratching at the blisters, speak to your GP or child and family health nurse about creams that might help.</p>

Take your child to your doctor if you’re not sure why your child has swollen lymph nodes, if they’re painful or getting bigger, or if you’re concerned. Treatment will depend on what’s causing the swollen lymph nodes.","<h1>What are swollen lymph nodes?</h1>

<p>There are lymph nodes throughout your body. They’re part of your immune system and work like a filter for viruses and bacteria.</p>

<p>Lymph nodes become swollen for many reasons. It’s usually nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Swollen lymph nodes happen most often when your body is busy fighting a viral or bacterial infection like a sore throat or glandular fever.</p>

<p>Swollen lymph nodes can also happen if a part of your body is inflamed – for example, because of an abrasion, burn or insect bite.</p>

<p>Some young children with eczema have swollen lymph nodes all the time. This is because germs more easily pass through their inflamed skin into their body and the lymph nodes help get rid of them.</p>

<p>Cancer is a rare cause of swollen lymph nodes in children. In these rare cases the noded are uasually not painful, they are quite firm and do <strong>not move</strong> when pushed.</p>

<p>Lymph nodes are also known as lymph glands.</p>

<p>Children’s lymph nodes are usually bigger and become swollen more often than those of adults, so it’s easier to feel them. You can sometimes feel the ones on either side of the neck, the armpits and at the front of the groin where your child’s leg bends, even when your child is well. If your child is thin, you might even be able to see them.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes</h2>

<p>Lymph nodes might swell up all over your child’s body or just in the area near the infection or inflammation.</p>

<p>For example, if your child has tonsillitis, you might notice swollen and tender lumps in her neck. Or if she has a skin infection on her finger there might be swollen and tender lumps under that arm.</p>

<p>Lymph nodes can stay swollen for 2-3 weeks after the infection has cleared up.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about swollen lymph nodes?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child has had swollen lymph nodes for a few days, and there’s no obvious reason for them, like a sore throat, runny nose or other mild infection</li>

	<li>tender, swollen lymph glands, mainly in the neck (and often in the armpits and groin)</li>
	<li>stomach pain, which is caused by an enlarged liver and spleen</li>
	<li>red, spotty rash on your child’s trunk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Glandular fever symptoms can last for weeks or even months, especially the tiredness or general lack of energy.</p>

<p><strong>Complications</strong> with glandular fever are rare. These complications include rupture of the spleen, and obstruction of air flow to the lungs due to the enlaged swollen tonsills.</p>

<p>More than 90% of adults have been infected with Epstein-Barr virus. These adults will have antibodies to the virus, and so won’t usually have a second episode of illness caused by this virus. This means that if your child has had glandular fever, he’s unlikely to get it again.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about glandular fever?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has a sore throat that doesn’t improve after five days</li>
	<li>complains of extreme tiredness, which doesn’t improve after a day or two of rest</li>
	<li>has swollen glands that remain swollen and/or painful for longer than a few days</li>
	<li>has stomach pain that lasts longer than a few days.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should see your doctor, go to hospital, or call an ambulance if your child has extreme stomach pain at any time or if she is trouble breathing.</p>

<p>Also see the doctor if you’re worried or have any other questions.</p>

<h2>Tests for glandular fever</h2>

<p>Your doctor might decide to confirm glandular fever by doing a blood test on your child.</p>

<h2>Treatment for glandular fever</h2>

<p>There’s <strong>no specific treatment, or vaccine</strong> for glandular fever.</p>

<p>Antibiotics work only for infections caused by bacteria. This means antibiotics don’t work for glandular fever, because it’s caused by a virus. Some antibiotics like ampicillin and amoxycillin may cause rash if given to children with glandular fever. </p>

<p>You can <strong>treat the symptoms</strong> of glandular fever. This includes managing pain and discomfort with paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses, and making sure your child gets plenty of rest, drinks lots of fluids and eats well.</p>

<p>If your doctor finds your child’s spleen is enlarged, your child should avoid contact sports for at least three months. Contact sports increase the risk of rupturing or tearing the spleen.</p>

<h2>Prevention of glandular fever</h2>

<p>If your child has glandular fever, encourage him not to share drinking containers or toothbrushes with other people. He should also avoid kissing people. It’s important to have good personal hygiene, particularly handwashing.</p>

<p>You don’t need to keep your child at home to control the spread of glandular fever.</p>",8506,2,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"761, 711, 306, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/glandular-fever"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/glandular-fever</a></p>",en,published
576,Scarlet fever,"Scarlet fever symptoms include a red bumpy rash, a red tongue, sore throat, swollen glands and fever. See your doctor if your child has scarlet fever symptoms. Your child needs antibiotics.","<h1>About scarlet fever</h1>

<p>Scarlet fever is a disease characterized by typical rash  that can happen when a child has an infection caused by the bacteria <em>Streptococcus pyogens </em>(group A strep). It’s usually a throat infection, but it can sometimes be a skin infection. Scarlet fever symptoms develop when the bacteria release toxins that spread through the child’s body.</p>

<p>Group A strep bacteria can spread from person to person through sneezing, coughing or touching the sores of someone with a skin infection.</p>

<h2>Scarlet fever symptoms</h2>

<p>Children with scarlet fever almost always have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a sore throat</li>
	<li>a rash</li>
	<li>tender and swollen lymph glands in their necks</li>
	<li>fever</li>
	<li>vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<h3> The rash</h3>

<p>The rash looks like a sunburn and feels like sandpaper. It typically begins on the face or neck and spreads to the body, arms and legs. If pressure is applied to the reddened skin, it will turn pale.</p>

<p>The folds of skin around the groin, armpits, elbows, knees and neck usually become a deeper red than the surrounding rash.</p>

<p> The face may appear flushed with a pale ring around the mouth</p>

<p>Children’s tongues might also turn bright red. This is sometimes called a ‘strawberry tongue’.</p>

<p>After the infection has gone away, children’s skin might peel, usually on the tips of their fingers and toes.</p>

<p>If your child has scarlet fever, he’s infectious for only 1-2 days after taking the right treatment. But he might be infectious for 10-21 days if he doesn’t get treatment.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about scarlet fever?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should take your child to the doctor if your child shows symptoms of scarlet fever.</p>

<h2>Tests for scarlet fever</h2>

<p>Your doctor might do a throat swab to confirm your child has <em>Streptococcus pyogens infection</em>.</p>

<h2>Treatment for scarlet fever</h2>

<p>Scarlet fever looks dramatic, but it’s usually easily treated with antibiotics from the<strong> </strong>penicillin<strong> </strong>group. If your child is allergic to penicillin, your doctor will prescribe a different kind of antibiotic.</p>

<p>With treatment, your child will usually get better within 24- 48 hours.</p>

<h2>Complications of scarlet fever</h2>

<p>If left untreated, this kind of infection can cause complications such as severe <em>Streptococcus pyogens infection, and sometimes dalayed complications such as </em>rheumatic fever and kidney damage (glomerulonephritis).</p>

<h2>Prevention of scarlet fever</h2>

<p>There’s no immunisation for scarlet fever.</p>

<p>To prevent group A strep bacteria from spreading, you, your child and other family members should wash hands regularly with warm soapy water. You should all try to keep your hands away from eyes, nose and mouth too.</p>",8861,2,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"766, 711, 306, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/scarlet-fever"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/scarlet-fever</a></p>",en,published
596,Chickenpox,"Chickenpox looks like a rash with red spots that turn into blisters. Use bicarbonate of soda and water or calamine lotion to help with the itch. Keep your child away from child care, preschool or school until the last blister has scabbed over. The best way to avoid chickenpox is to immunise your child.","<h1>About chickenpox</h1>

<p>Chickenpox is a contagious disease that’s caused by the <em>Varicella zoster</em> virus.</p>

<p>Chickenpox can spread through:</p>

<ul>
	<li>direct physical contact with someone who has chickenpox</li>
	<li>sneezing and coughing</li>
	<li>direct physical contact with someone who has shingles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like chickenpox, shingles is caused by the <em>Varicella zoster</em> virus. If you’ve previously had chickenpox and the virus is reactivated, you can get shingles.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of chickenpox</h2>

<p>Children infected with the chickenpox virus don’t usually have symptoms until 10-21 days after contact.</p>

<p>In children, the illness usually starts with a general feeling of tiredness, as well as a fever. Over the next 2-5 days, a rash breaks out.</p>

<p>At first, this rash appears as red spots, which develop into crops of small blisters over the chest, back, tummy or face. These soon appear on the rest of the body, and might even come up in the mouth or ears, or on the genitals or eyes. The blisters are extremely itchy, and new ones form as older ones scab over and dry up. The scabs can take several weeks to fall off.</p>

<p>The rash doesn’t leave any scars unless the blisters or scabs are scratched, or the sores get infected.</p>

<p>Chickenpox symptoms tend to be much milder in children than in adults.</p>

<p>Chickenpox is contagious from two days before the rash appears until all existing sores or blisters have formed scabs and are completely dry. This usually takes around a week.</p>

<h2>Chickenpox complications and risks</h2>

<p>Healthy children mostly have an itchy rash but no other complications. Rarely, chickenpox sores can get infected with bacteria. The bacteria can go on to cause severe sytemic infection. Other complications include pneumonia and encephalitis.</p>

<p>There are some children who are at high risk if they come into contact with chickenpox. The virus can affect them very severely. These children include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Newborn babies</li>
	<li>children who have low immunity</li>
	<li>children with cancer</li>
	<li>children who are taking immunosuppressant medication like high-dose corticosteroids.</li>
</ul>

<p>These children need to be kept away from people with chickenpox. </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about chickenpox?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if you’re worried your child might have chickenpox.</p>

<p>You should also talk with your doctor if your child is in one of a high-risk groups above and has been in contact with someone who could have chickenpox.</p>

<p>Women who are pregnant are also at high risk and should see a doctor.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Treatment for chickenpox</h2>

<p>Children with chickenpox usually need treatment only to relieve symptoms like itch and fever.</p>

<p>To <strong>help with the itch</strong>, soak gauze pads in bicarbonate of soda and water and put the pads over the sores. Creams like calamine lotion might also help. If your child really can’t stand the itching, your doctor might prescribe an antihistamine medicine.</p>

<p>Give paracetamol according to directions if your child is miserable with a fever.</p>

<p>It can help to keep your child nails short. This way, if he does scratch, the sores are less likely to get infected. </p>

<p>High risk children and children who have severe chickenpox might be given acyclovir, an anti-viral medication. Your doctor might prescribe antibiotics for skin infections and pneumonia. Somtimes the child might need to be hopitalized and get intravenous treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Keep your child away from child care, preschool or school </strong>until the last blister has scabbed over.</p>

<p>Don’t give your child aspirin. Children treated with aspirin might develop Reye’s syndrome, a rare but very serious condition.</p>

Your baby or toddler needs to see a doctor as soon as possible if she has UTI symptoms. Doctors will test your child’s urine to diagnose a UTI. Antibiotics are usually used to treat UTIs. The doctor might also refer your child for an ultrasound to make sure there are no problems in their urinary tracts.","<h1>About urinary tract infections (UTIs)</h1>

<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) happen when bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra or through the blood, get into urine and then grow in the bladder.</p>

<p>UTIs are quite common in babies and toddlers. About 4% of babies will have a UTI in the first 12 months. At this age, boys get more UTIs than girls.</p>

<p>Children who have abnormalities in the structure of their kidneys or urinary tract are more likely to get UTIs. But if your young child gets a UTI, this doesn’t necessarily mean that he has an abnormality of the urinary tract.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of urinary tract infections in babies and toddlers</h2>

<p>In babies and toddlers, the symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) can look like the symptoms of many other health issues. If your child has a UTI, she might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>have an unexplained fever</li>
	<li>be irritable and cry a lot</li>
	<li>go off her feeds</li>
	<li>vomit</li>
	<li>be unusually drowsy</li>
	<li>have poor weight gain</li>
	<li>have a bloody nappy.</li>
</ul>

<p>UTIs in older children are different from UTIs in babies and toddlers. If your older child has a urinary tract infection, it might sting when she wees, or she might feel she needs to wee a lot.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about a urinary tract infection (UTI)?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should take your child to the doctor or go to a hospital emergency department straight away if your child has a high, unexplained fever or is generally unwell.</p>

<h2>Tests for urinary tract infections (UTIs)</h2>

<p>Doctors can’t diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI) just on your child’s symptoms. They need to test your child’s urine as well. The doctor might also refer your child for an ultrasound to make sure there are no problems in their urinary tracts. If a problem is identified, your child might be referred to nephrologist or renal physician – that is, a doctor who specialises in kidney problems.</p>

<h2>Treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs)</h2>

<p>Babies <strong>under three months</strong> usually need to have antibiotics directly into a vein through a drip to treat a urinary tract infection (UTI). This means they need to be treated in hospital.</p>

<p>Babies <strong>older than three months</strong> can sometimes be treated at home with antibiotics by mouth.</p>

<h2>Preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs)</h2>

<p>You can’t prevent  urinary tract infections (UTIs) in babies and toddlers. And if your baby needs hospital treatment for a UTI, it can be quite upsetting.

611,Undescended testicle,"If your child has an undescended testicle, it means his testicle hasn’t moved into the scrotum before birth. This condition isn’t painful but can increase the risk of several other health issues. See your doctor if you think your child has an undescended testicle. It should be treated by surgery until your child is 1 yr old.","<h1>What is an undescended testicle?</h1>

<p>When a boy is developing in the womb, his testicles (testes) form in his abdomen. In the last few months of development, the testicles move down into the scrotum. An undescended testicle is one that hasn’t moved down to sit fully within the scrotum at birth.</p>

<p>Around 2-4% of newborn boys have an undescended testicle. For some boys, the testicle might move down by itself within the first three months.</p>

<p>Rarely a testicle can sometimes become undescended at around 4-10 years of age. In this case, the testicle is in the scrotum at birth. As the boy grows, the cord attached to the testicle (the spermatic cord) doesn’t grow at the same rate. This causes the testicle to be pulled up into the groin.</p>

<p>An undescended testicle can increase the risk of several health issues including twisting (torsion), hernia, reduced fertility and testicular cancer.</p>

<p>The medical name for an undescended testicle is cryptorchidism.</p>

<p>An undescended testicle is different from a retractile testicle. A retractile testicle is one that sits normally in the scrotum but pulls up when your son is cold, embarrassed or upset. It comes down again when your son is warm or has calmed down. Although retractile testicles are normal, it’s a good idea to have your doctor check it out.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of an undescended testicle</h2>

<p>An undescended testicle doesn’t sit in the scrotum. It’s usually in the groin or in the lower abdomen.</p>

<p>This condition <strong>doesn’t cause any pain.</strong></p>

<p>Every now and then when you’re bathing your baby son or changing his nappy, check that you can see and feel both his testicles in his scrotum. Your doctor will also check them during routine check-ups. </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about an undescended testicle?</h2>

<p>If you think your son has an undescended testicle, you need to see your doctor. Your doctor  might refer your son to a surgeon .</p>

<p>An ultrasound or other tests are rarely needed.</p>

<h2>Treatment for an undescended testicle</h2>

<p>If an undescended testicle was found after birth, your son should be re-evaluated at 3 to 6 months. If your son’s testicle hasn’t descended by this time he might need surgery to bring it down into the scrotum.</p>

<p>This surgery is called an orchidopexy and is usually done around 1 yr of age to prevent long-term damage to the testicles and reduces the risk of the other problems.</p>

616,Circumcision,"Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not considered sufficient to recommend
routine neonatal circumcision. It is legitimate for parents to take into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions. Make sure the operation is done safely and with adequate pain control.","<h1>What is circumcision?</h1>

<p>Circumcision is a surgical operation that removes some skin or tissue from the genitals of a boy or girl. All forms of female circumcision are illegal. This article refers only to the circumcision of boys.</p>

<p>At birth, most boys have a sleeve of skin covering the end of the penis. This protective sleeve is called the foreskin. During a circumcision, this sleeve of skin is cut away, exposing the glans (head) of the penis.</p>

<p>Circumcision is sometimes done a few days after birth. It can be done later, including in adolescence or adulthood.</p>

<p><img alt=""picture of uncircumcised and circumcised penises"" src=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/__data/assets/image/0021/39216/uncircumcised-circumcised-penises_m.jpg"" /></p>

<h2>Reasons for not having your son circumcised</h2>

<p>Circumcision comes with infrequent <strong>medical and health risks</strong>, even when an experienced doctor does the operation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Short-term problems include bleeding after the operation. Sometimes boys need to go to hospital to manage bleeding.</li>
	<li>Long-term problems include issues with urination and concerns about the appearance of the penis, particularly if too much or too little skin has been removed, or if more skin has been removed from one side than the other.</li>
	<li>In very rare cases, these problems can lead to damage to the urethra, gangrene, loss of the penis, or even death.</li>
</ul>

<p>Doctors, parents and others say that there are <strong>physical and ethical reasons</strong> for not having your son circumcised:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The foreskin is a natural part of a boy’s body. It’s rich in nerve endings and has a big role in sexual sensation, play and functioning as boys grow older.</li>
	<li>The foreskin protects the opening of the urethra, which is very delicate early in life.</li>
	<li>Boys should be able to make informed decisions about their own bodies. They can do this only when they’re older.</li>
	<li>It doesn’t make sense for our society to make all forms of female circumcision illegal but still allow male circumcision.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reasons for having your son circumcised</h2>

<p>Circumcision before puberty has a couple of <strong>health and medical benefits</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It reduces the risk that a baby boy will get a urinary tract infection (UTIs).</li>
	<li>It can prevent foreskin problems, including foreskin inflammation and foreskins that are too tight in puberty.</li>
</ul>

<p>For older boys and men, circumcision has some benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It helps to protect men against HIV and AIDS and possibly some other sexually transmitted infections.</li>
	<li>It helps to protect men against the rare condition of cancer of the penis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some parents might also choose circumcision for religious or cultural reasons – for example, Jewish or Islamic customs.</p>

<p>The circumcision debate is passionate. There are some extreme viewpoints on both sides. But you can trust evidence published by official medical organisations like the American Academy of Pediatrics or The Australian Parenting Website. It is legitimate for parents to take into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions and it’s sensible to treat other opinions with caution.</p>

<h2>Circumcision: making an informed choice</h2>

<p>When weighing up the risks and benefits of circumcision for your son, it’s important to consider all the evidence and information. You could ask your paediatrician to talk you through the risks and benefits.</p>

<p>Whatever you decide about circumcision, your son is likely to have a normal childhood and adult life, without significant concerns about his penis.</p>

<h2>Planning for circumcision</h2>

<p>If you decide to have your son circumcised, it’s important to make sure the operation is done safely and by an experienced and authorized professional.</p>

<p>Try to ensure that your son receives enough pain relief during and after the procedure. Local anaesthetic might be appropriate for boys under six months, but it’s recommended that boys over six months have either general anaesthetic or spinal anaesthetic.</p>

<p>Check that you have good access to the doctor for follow-up after the surgery.</p>

621,Coeliac disease,"If your child has coeliac disease, his body reacts abnormally to a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, rye, barley and sometimes also in oats. You and your child can manage coeliac disease by removing foods with gluten from your child’s diet.","<h1>About coeliac disease</h1>

<p><strong>Coeliac disease is a kind of autoimmune disease. ‘</strong>Autoimmune’ means that the body mistakenly attacks itself when it senses a particular trigger. With coeliac disease, the trigger is a protein called gluten, which is in wheat, rye, barley and may be also in oats.</p>

<p>Coeliac disease affects the lining of the small intestine, which is covered in villi. Villi are like tiny fingers that stick out from the intestinal lining. If your child has coeliac disease, eating foods with gluten damages the villi. If the villi are damaged, your child’s body can’t absorb nutrients properly.</p>

<p>Coeliac disease affects about 1 in 70-100 people. Both children and adults can develop the condition at any age. In children, this can be as young as around six months, once solids containing gluten are introduced.</p>

<h2>Causes of coeliac disease</h2>

<p>Coeliac disease can run in families. People with coeliac disease inherit genes from one or both parents that make it more likely they might develop it. But not everyone with these genes will go on to develop the condition.</p>

<p>If you, your child’s other parent or one of your child’s siblings has coeliac disease, your child has around 10% chance of also having the condition.</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms of coeliac disease</h2>

<p>Coeliac disease can cause many different signs and symptoms.</p>

<p>If your child has coeliac disease, signs and symptoms might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>nausea and vomiting</li>
	<li>diarrhoea</li>
	<li>constipation</li>
	<li>poor appetite</li>
	<li>stomach<a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/stomach-ache""> </a>pain</li>
	<li>mouth ulcers</li>
	<li>iron deficiency</li>
	<li>anaemia</li>
	<li>delayed growth or late puberty</li>
	<li>weight loss</li>
	<li>tiredness and irritability.</li>
</ul>

<p>If coeliac disease isn’t diagnosed and treated, it can cause severe long-term health problems, including malnutrition, poor growth, lactose intolerance, osteoporosis, arthritis, liver disease, epilepsy, infertility and cancer.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about coeliac disease</h2>

<p>If you notice any of the symptoms above and they’re unexplained or last for more than two weeks, you should take your child to see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing coeliac disease</h2>

<p>The first step in diagnosing coeliac disease is a <strong>blood test to </strong>measure specific celiac antibodies. If your child has a high level of these antibodies, Your doctor will then refer you to a gastroenterologist.</p>

<p>The gastroenterologist will do a <strong>gastroscopy</strong> to confirm that your child has coeliac disease.</p>

<p>A gastroscopy is done under a light anaesthetic and takes about 10 minutes. A flexible tube is passed through your child’s mouth and into her small intestine where small tissue samples are taken.</p>

<p>Doctors can look at these samples to see whether the villi are damaged. If they’re damaged, it means that your child has coeliac disease.</p>

<p>In some cases, your child might need to do a blood test to see if he has the genes that can lead to coeliac disease. This might happen if the other tests are unclear.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Treatment of coeliac disease</h2>

<p>There’s currently no cure for coeliac disease. But it can be managed by following a <strong>strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet</strong>.</p>

<p>Once your child stops eating gluten, his small intestine can heal and he should start to feel better, usually within a few days or weeks.</p>

<h2>Managing coeliac disease</h2>

<p>Even trace amounts of gluten in your child’s diet can damage your child’s small intestine, although your child mightn’t always show signs or symptoms. So <strong>sticking to a gluten free diet is very important</strong>. Here’s how.</p>

<p><strong>Removing foods with gluten from your child’s diet</strong><br />
Gluten is found in wheat, rye, barley and oats, so you can start by cutting out foods made with these ingredients. These foods might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>bread</li>
	<li>cakes</li>
	<li>biscuits</li>
	<li>breakfast cereals</li>
	<li>pizza bases</li>
	<li>pasta</li>
	<li>pastry</li>
	<li>crumbed or battered food.</li>
</ul>

<p>When your child is first diagnosed, it’s important to talk with a dietitian about how to manage a gluten-free diet for your child.</p>

<p><strong>Other important steps include:</strong></p>

<p>Keeping gluten-free food separate at home<br />
Reading labels on all foods<br />
Taking care when you eat out  </p>

<p>Looking for gluten-free alternatives:  There are lots of gluten-free cookbooks to help you come up with some new menu ideas. You might like to ask your dietitian to recommend some reliable recipes, cookbooks and websites. Some children and adults can eat oats without problems and you can discuss this with your doctor.</p>

<p>Even if your child has coeliac disease, she can still have a balanced and nutritious diet.</p>",8851,2,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"836, 841, 846, 851, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/coeliac-disease"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/coeliac-disease</a></p>",en,published

<h2>Signs and symptoms of type-2 diabetes</h2>

<p>Signs and symptoms of type-2 diabetes include:</p>

<p>•increased urination over a period of weeks</p>

<p>•increased thirst and drinking over a period of weeks</p>

<p>•weight gain</p>

<p>•tiredness</p>

<p>•mood changes</p>

<p>•dehydration.</p>

<p>When there’s high sugar in the blood, the kidneys try to flush it out in urine. This why children with type-2 diabetes might be urinating more. And because the body is making lots of urine to try to get rid of the sugar, it’s also using and losing lots of water. This is why children can get dehydrated.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about type-1 diabetes symptoms?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes</strong>. If your child has some or all of the signs and symptoms of type-2 diabetes listed above, see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Tests for type-2 diabetes</h2>

<p>Your doctor can diagnose diabetes in your child by doing a finger-prick blood test and a urine test, and by reviewing your child’s symptoms. If there’s glucose in your child’s urine and a high level of glucose in his blood, the doctor will send you and your child to your nearest hospital emergency department.</p>

<p>Doctors in the hospital emergency department might do more tests if they’re not sure</p>

<p> whether your child has type-2 or type-1 diabetes.</p>

<h2>Treatment for type-2 diabetes</h2>

<p>There’s no rapid cure for type-2 diabetes, but your child can manage this condition successfully.</p>

<p>The aim of type-2 diabetes management is keeping blood sugar levels within a target range.</p>

<p>Your child will probably have a management plan that includes some or all of the following treatments and strategies:</p>

<p>•medications</p>

<p>•changes to diet</p>

<p>•exercise</p>

<p>•weight loss</p>

<p>•regular blood glucose tests.</p>

<p>•insulin injections if the diabetes is severe.</p>

<p>Your child’s diabetes team will work with you and your child to develop an individual management plan.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Preventing complications from type-2 diabetes</h2>

<p>High blood sugar levels can lead to long-term complications like nerve damage, kidney damage, vision problems, pain or loss of sensation in the hands and feet, and heart disease.</p>

<p>Your child is unlikely to have these complications, but he needs to manage his diabetes carefully to avoid complications in the future.</p>

<p>If your whole family eats well and gets enough daily physical activity, you set a good example for your child and make it easier for her to stick with her diabetes management plan.</p>

<h2>Preventing type-2 diabetes</h2>

<p>Type 2 diabetes has a strong link to family history but  <strong>it also depends on environmental factors that you can sucessfully control!</strong></p>

<p>A healthy lifestyle can help prevent type-2 diabetes incuding regular physical activity and healthy eating.</p>

<p>Type-2 diabetes mostly affects older people. It’s unusual for children under 10 years to get type-2 diabetes.</p>",7746,2,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"856, 861, 866, 131, 541",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/type-2-diabetes"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/type-2-diabetes</a></p>",en,published
631,Type-1 diabetes,"Symptoms of type-1 diabetes include frequent urination, thirst, tiredness and weight loss. These can develop quite suddenly. See the doctor if your child has these symptoms. Call an ambulance if your child’s symptoms get worse suddenly. You can usually treat and manage type-1 diabetes successfully with insulin plus diet and physical activity.","<h1>About type-1 diabetes</h1>

<p>In type-1 diabetes, the pancreas makes little or no insulin.</p>

<p>Insulin is a hormone that normally helps turn glucose into energy for the body. Glucose is the simplest form of sugar and the body’s main source of energy. Inslin also inhibits breakdown of fat.</p>

<p>When the body can’t turn glucose into energy, glucose builds up in blood. High blood sugar creates a lot of health problems unless it’s treated. Also, low levels of insulin cause the accumulation of fatty acids in the blood.</p>

<p>Type-1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. ‘Autoimmune’ means the body imune system attacks itself. In type-1 diabetes, the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin and this stops the cells from working. Type-1 diabetes is different from type-2 diabetes, which is often linked to lifestyle factors.</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms of type-1 diabetes</h2>

<p>The symptoms of type-1 diabetes usually develop suddenly over a period of days – or sometimes hours. They can develop over weeks too.</p>

<p><strong>Early signs and symptoms </strong>of type-1 diabetes include:</p>

<p>•frequent urination and/or bed-wetting in your previously ‘dry’ child</p>

<p>•increased thirst and the desire to drink more than usual</p>

<p>•weight loss</p>

<p>•tiredness</p>

<p>•mood changes or increased irritability</p>

<p>•blurred vision.</p>

<p>Some <strong>other possible signs o</strong>r symptoms include:</p>

<p>•fruity-smelling breath</p>

<p>•oral thrush, vaginal thrush or skin infections</p>

<p>•extreme hunger</p>

<p>•dehydration.</p>

<p>You might also notice your child not doing as well as usual at school, because he isn’t feeling well.</p>

<p>If early symptoms of type-1 diabetes aren’t picked up and treated, or diabetes comes on quickly, your child might also experience nausea, vomiting and tummy pain.</p>

<p>When there’s high sugar in the blood, the kidneys try to flush it out in urine. This why children with type-1 diabetes might be urinating more. And because the body is making lots of urine to try to get rid of the sugar, it’s also using and losing lots of water. This is why children can get dehydrated.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about type-1 diabetes symptoms?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes!!</strong> If your child has any of the symptoms of type-1 diabetes, see your doctor as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A child with type-1 diabetes can become very unwell very quickly. <strong>Call an ambulance </strong>if you notice any of the following symptoms in your child:</p>

<p>•panting</p>

<p>•confusion</p>

<p>•drowsiness.</p>

<p>These symptoms might point to a condition called <strong>diabetic ketoacidosis.</strong> It can be life-threatening, so your child needs immediate medical attention.</p>

<h2>Tests for type-1 diabetes</h2>

<p>Your doctor can diagnose diabetes in your child by doing a finger-prick blood test and a urine test, and by looking at your child’s symptoms.</p>

<p>If there’s glucose in your child’s urine and/or a high level of glucose in his blood, your doctor will send your child to your nearest emergency department.</p>

<p>If you’re still worried about your child or her symptoms are getting worse, go to your nearest emergency department.</p>

<h2>Treatment for type-1 diabetes</h2>

<p>There is currently no rapid cure for type-1 diabetes.</p>

<p>If your child has type-1 diabetes, he can manage his condition successfully and live a normal life by keeping his blood sugar levels within a target range. Your child can keep his blood sugar within this target range by:</p>

<p>•injecting insulin 2-4 times a day or by using a 24-hour insulin pump</p>

<p>•eating certain foods in the right amounts and at the right times</p>

<p>•doing physical activity.</p>

<p>It is better that your child will have a team of diabetes health professionals to care for her including endocrinologists, nurse educators, dietitians, social workers and psychologists.</p>

<h2>Preventing complications from type-1 diabetes</h2>

<p>You can lower your child’s risk of complications from type-1 diabetes by keeping your child’s blood sugar levels within the target range most of the time.</p>

<p>High blood sugar levels can lead to short-term complications like diabetic ketoacidosis as well as long-term complications like nerve damage, kidney damage, vision problems, heart disease or stroke.</p>

<p>Low blood sugar levels can lead to drowsiness, aggression, unconsciousness or seizure.</p>

<h2>Causes of type-1 diabetes</h2>

<p>In most cases of type 1 diabetes, people need to inherit risk factors from both parents. In addition, there it is necessary to have enviromental triggers for the disease to appear. We don’t know what triggers type-1 diabetes but viruses, cold climate, diet, stress and  puberty might be triggers.</p>

<p>Over 90% of children and teenagers with diabetes have type-1 diabetes. Type-1 diabetes is most commonly diagnosed in children aged 10-14 years and rarely in children under one year.</p>",7741,2,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"871, 861, 541, 131, 876, 881",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/type-1-diabetes"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/type-1-diabetes</a></p>",en,published
636,Dehydration,"Dehydration might happen if your child has lots of diarrhoea and vomiting, doesn’t drink enough, exercises a lot or sweats a lot. You should see your doctor if you’re concerned your child is dehydrated. Dehydration can be treated by increasing your child’s fluids. In severe cases, your child might need to go to hospital to get more fluids.","<h1>What is dehydration?</h1>

<p>If your child loses a lot of body fluids or isn’t drinking enough, he might get dehydrated.</p>

<p>Gastroenteritis is the most common cause of dehydration. This is because it can make your child lose a lot of body fluids quickly. Any illness with persistent diarrhoea, vomiting or reduced fluid intake can result in dehydration.</p>

<p>Lots of sweating can also result in dehydration, particularly in babies in very hot weather, or in adolescent children who are doing vigorous activity.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of dehydration</h2>

<p>A child who’s dehydrated might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>wee less often – a younger child might have fewer wet nappies or her nappies might not be as wet as usual</li>
	<li>look gaunt and pale</li>
	<li>be tired, lethargic or irritable</li>
	<li>have fewer tears</li>
	<li>be thirsty</li>
	<li>have sunken and dark eyes</li>
	<li>have a coated and dry tongue and mouth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to see a doctor about dehydration</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you’re worried that your child might be dehydrated</li>
	<li>your child is vomiting often and can’t keep any fluids down</li>
	<li>your child has lots of diarrhoea</li>
	<li>your child is under the age of six months and has dehydration symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take your child to a <strong>hospital emergency department</strong> straight away if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child has symptoms of severe dehydration – he’s not passing urine, is pale and thin, has sunken eyes, cold hands and feet, and is drowsy or cranky</li>
	<li>your child has severe stomach pain</li>
	<li>your child’s vomit is a green colour or has blood in it</li>
	<li>you’re worried that your child is very unwell.</li>
</ul>

<p>You know your child best, so trust your instincts if your child doesn’t seem well. Signs that your child has a serious illness that needs urgent medical attention include severe pain, drowsiness, pale or blue skin, dehydration, troubled breathing, seizures and reduced responsiveness.</p>

<h2>Treatment for dehydration</h2>

<p>You can treat mild cases of dehydration by giving your child <strong>more fluid</strong>.</p>

<p>One option is <strong>oral rehydration fluid</strong> like. You can buy these fluids over the counter from a pharmacy.</p>

<p>Other options include water, diluted lemonade, cordial or fruit juice. If you’re using a sugary drink, it’s important to dilute it – use one part of lemonade, cordial or juice to four parts of water.</p>

<p>Your child might not be keen to drink. You can try to get her drinking more by giving her drinks via a syringe or spoon, or letting her suck icy poles. </p>

<p>If your child is vomiting, it’s usually better to <strong>offer small amounts, but frequently</strong>. For example, give your child a few mouthfuls every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>If you have a <strong>breastfed baby older than six months</strong>, keep breastfeeding but feed more often. You can give your child extra oral rehydration fluid between feeds.</p>

<p>If your <strong>baby is older than six months and is bottle fed</strong>, give him oral rehydration fluid for the first 12-24 hours  and then reintroduce full-strength formula in smaller, more frequent feeds. You can still offer extra oral rehydration fluids between feeds.</p>

<p>In more severe cases, your child might need to go to hospital to catch up on fluid loss.</p>

<p>In many cases, the safest and quickest way to do this is by via a small tube that goes into your child’s nose and then into his stomach. The rehydrating fluids go through this tube. Alternatively, your child will be given fluids intravenously (directly into the vein).</p>

<h2>Prevention of dehydration</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid significant dehydration is to see your doctor if your child has an illness that’s causing her to lose lots of fluid or stop drinking.</p>

<p>On hot days or when your child is exercising, he needs to stay hydrated. Make sure there’s plenty of water handy so your child can drink if he’s thirsty. You might need to remind some children to have regular drink breaks.</p>",7361,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"886, 891, 486, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/dehydration"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/dehydration</a></p>",en,published

	<li>is taking some medications</li>
	<li>has food intolerances</li>
	<li>gets motion sickness.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms of nausea</h2>

<p>Older children and teenagers will probably tell you that they feel sick or feel like they’re going to vomit.</p>

<p>Younger children might not be able to tell you that they feel like vomiting, but might look pale and unwell.</p>

<p>Sometimes nausea happens by itself, and sometimes your child might actually vomit.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about nausea?</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if your child’s nausea lasts for more than 24 hours or your child has nausea plus any of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>vomiting</li>
	<li>recent head trauma</li>
	<li>stomach pain or bloating.</li>
	<li>high fever</li>

	<li>confusion and drowsiness</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child has nausea and you’re worried that he’s very unwell, see your doctor or go to a hospital emergency department.</p>

<h2>Nausea treatment</h2>

<p>If your child has nausea, simple treatment is usually the best. It’s also good if you can work out what’s causing the nausea and treat this underlying cause.</p>

<p>For example, for nausea that’s linked to gastro, make sure your child avoids fatty foods or heavy meals. Instead, encourage your child to have lots of small drinks of water or oral rehydration fluid, as well as bland foods like dry biscuits.</p>

<p>Older children with nausea can try sucking on a sugary lolly like barley sugar.</p>

<p>If your child is in hospital with an illness and has nausea, strong medicines given through a drip or in the mouth can help. </p>

<p>Medicines to prevent nausea rarely work can have very unpleasant side effects in young children.</p>",7711,2,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"896, 306, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/nausea"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/nausea</a></p>",en,published

If your child has tummy pain that might be appendicitis, he needs to see a doctor or go to hospital straight away. A burst appendix can be life-threatening. Surgery to remove the inflamed appendix is the preferred treatment for appendicitis.","<h1>What is appendicitis?</h1>

<p>Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix – that is, the appendix gets red, swollen and irritated. The appendix is a small finger-like tube that grows out of the large bowel.</p>

<h2>Appendicitis symptoms</h2>

<p>The main symptom of appendicitis is stomach pain.</p>

<p>Appendicitis pain usually starts in the middle of your child’s stomach near his belly button. It might feel like a dull cramp. Over the next few hours, the pain becomes sharper. Many times the pain concentrated at the lower right side of the stomach, over the appendix.</p>

<p>Your child might be more uncomfortable when she’s trying to sit upright or walk straight. The pain will often get worse when she moves.</p>

<p>Your child might also have fever, vomiting, loose poo or constipation and no appetite.</p>

<p>School-age children and teenagers are more likely to get appendicitis than preschool children and babies. The symptoms of appendicitis aren’t as clear in young children as in teenagers or adults. You might not even know that a young child has tummy pain.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about appendicitis pain?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong> If your child has tummy pain that’s getting worse, take your child to the doctor or hospital emergency department.</p>

<p>If your child is extremely unwell and even a small amount of movement causes him pain, take him to a hospital emergency department straight away. You might need to call an ambulance in this situation.</p>

<p>There’s always a risk of the inflamed appendix bursting and releasing pus into the abdomen. This is called a ruptured appendix. This isn’t very common, but without treatment it can be life-threatening.</p>

<h2>Tests for appendicitis</h2>

<p>Appendicitis can be difficult to diagnose.</p>

<p>Your doctor or the emergency department doctor might order a urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection, and also a blood test to see whether there’s evidence of infection or inflammation somewhere in her body.</p>

<p>The doctor might also order an abdominal ultrasound. </p>

<h2>Treatment for appendicitis</h2>

<p><strong>Surgery</strong> to remove the inflamed appendix is the preferredonly treatment in children. Even though mild cases of appendicitis in adults may be treated by antibiotics alone, surgery is still the preferred treatment in children. </p>

<p>There are two kinds of surgery to take out an appendix:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Keyhole surgery</strong> (laparoscopy) is where a camera and special instruments are inserted through three small cuts in different parts of your child’s abdomen.</li>
	<li><strong>Open surgery</strong> is where a single, larger cut is made in your child’s abdomen.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the appendix doesn’t seem to have a function in food digestion, your child won’t have any problems if it’s taken out.</p>

<h2>Causes of appendicitis</h2>

<p>We don’t know what causes appendicitis. One theory is that if food or poo gets stuck in the appendix, it can cause a blockage, which can then get infected with bacteria.</p>

<p>We also don’t clearly know why we have an appendix or what it’s supposed to do in our bodies. It might had some functions during evolution and during the development of the baby in the womb.</p>",8866,2,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"901, 306, 906, 911, 916",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/appendicitis"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/appendicitis</a></p>",en,published

Makes sure your child gets plenty of water or oral hydration fluid. See your doctor if your child seems unwell, and you’re concerned.","<h2>About vomiting in babies, children and teenagers</h2>

<p>Vomiting in children has many causes, but the most common are minor illnesses like gastroenteritis and sometimes even colds can cause vomiting in children.</p>

<p>Other causes of vomiting include motion sickness, urinary tract infections.and more serious illnesses like appendicitis or meningitis, bowel obstruction or part of head injury.</p>

<p>Some types of vomiting are normal. For example, young babies tend to vomit up small amounts of milk after feeds. This is known as reflux.</p>

<p>Vomiting is very common in children. But it can be an unpleasant and frightening experience for you and your child. It might help to know that most of the time children get over vomiting very quickly.</p>

<h2>Symptoms related to vomiting</h2>

<p>Children who are vomiting often also have stomach pain, diarrhoea and nausea.</p>

<p>Dehydration is one of the serious risks of vomiting, especially in young babies. Signs of dehydration include fewer wees (with fewer wet nappies in babies), sunken eyes, dry tongue and mouth, loss of weight, tiredness and lethargy.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about vomiting?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the GP if your child:</p>

	<li>is vomiting often</li>
	<li>is unwell </li>
	<li>shows  abnormakl behaviour such as lethargy or restlessness</li>

<p><strong>Projectile vomiting</strong><br />
Projectile vomiting is when young babies throw up the contents of their stomachs with a lot of force. This can be linked to a serious condition called pyloric stenosis. If your child has projectile vomiting that happens often and doesn’t seem to be going away, you should see your doctor as soon as you can.</p>

<p>You know your child best, so trust your instincts if your child doesn’t seem well. Signs that your child has a serious illness that requires urgent medical attention include severe pain, drowsiness, pale or blue skin, dehydration, troubled breathing, seizures and reduced responsiveness.</p>

<h2>Treatment for vomiting</h2>

<p>If your child is vomiting, the most important thing is to <strong>give your child small amounts to drink often</strong> – for example, a few mouthfuls every 15 minutes. Either water or oral rehydration fluid is best. This will help to prevent dehydration. To get a sense of whether your child is drinking enough, check how much your child is weeing.</p>

<p>Your child also needs reassurance and comfort.</p>

<p><strong>You shouldn’t use over-the-counter medications</strong> to stop vomiting in children. The side effects of these medications can be very serious. Sometimes doctors prescribe medications to stop vomiting, but they do this only after proper medical review.</p>

<p>If your baby suffers from gastro-oesophageal reflux, various treatment strategies can help. It’s best to start by seeing your doctor.</p>",7736,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"891, 306, 886",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/vomiting"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/vomiting</a></p>",en,published
656,Overstimulation: babies and children,"A stimulating environment to play in and explore helps your child learn and grow. But sometimes too many activities add up to overstimulation, so downtime is important for your child too. It is all about finding a balance that is right for your child.","<h2>What is overstimulation?</h2>

<p>Overstimulation happens when a child is swamped by <strong>more experiences, sensations, noise and activity than she can cope with</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, a newborn baby might get very unsettled after a party where he has been cuddled by lots of grown-ups. A preschooler might have a tantrum after a big event like a birthday party. A school-age child might be cranky if he goes to school, then after-school care and then a swimming lesson.</p>

<p>Overstimulated children get tired and can feel overwhelmed. When this happens, they need quiet time and a familiar, calm environment.</p>

<h2>Signs of overstimulation</h2>

<p>If your <strong>newborn or baby</strong> is overstimulated, she might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>be cranky or tired</li>
	<li>cry more</li>
	<li>seem upset or turn her head away from you</li>
	<li>move in a jerky way</li>
	<li>clench her fists, wave her arms or kick.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your <strong>toddler or preschooler</strong> is overstimulated, he might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>seem tired, cranky and upset</li>
	<li>cry and not be able to use words to describe his feelings</li>
	<li>throw himself on the floor in tears or anger</li>
	<li>tell you that he does not want to do a particular activity anymore</li>
	<li>refuse to do simple things like putting on a seatbelt.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will get to know the particular signs that your child shows when she is overstimulated.</p>

<h2>Balancing activity time and quiet time</h2>

<p>In the first five years of life, <strong>your child’s brain develops more and faster</strong> than at any other time in his life. Your child’s early experiences – the things he sees, hears, touches, smells and tastes – stimulate his brain, creating millions of connections.</p>

<p>This means your child needs a stimulating environment with lots of different activities that give her plenty of ways to play and learn, and lots of chances to practise what she is learning.</p>

<p>But it does not mean you need to spend all day every day dangling toys in front of your baby, or that you have to rush your child from school to extracurricular activities. <strong>Babies and young children also need quiet time</strong> in predictable and familiar settings.</p>

<p>Your child will benefit from quietly entertaining himself, exploring his environment in his own way and at his own pace. This time lets your child learn how to occupy himself, work out when he needs quiet time and find things to do in that time to make himself feel better.</p>

<h2>Babies: dealing with overstimulation</h2>

<p>When you see that your baby is overwhelmed, take her somewhere quiet where she can calm down – for example, her cot. If you are out with your baby, you can put her in the pram and cover it with a light wrap or blanket.</p>

<p>Wrapping newborns and babies can help them calm down because it reduces physical sensations. Your baby might also find it soothing to be carried next to your body in a sling or something similar, as you go about your everyday activities.</p>

<h2>Toddlers and preschoolers: dealing with overstimulation</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas for handling your overstimulated toddler or preschooler:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try to stay calm yourself. This will help your child to calm down too.</li>
	<li>Reduce the noise and activity around your child. For example, turn off the TV or radio and take your child to his bedroom, or let him spend time near you if he needs to be close to you to wind down.</li>
	<li>Help your child put into words the feelings that she is expressing through behaviour. For example, you could say, ‘I can see that you’re upset’, ‘I can see that you’re feeling overwhelmed’.</li>
	<li>Sit quietly with your child and choose a calming activity. You could read a story, lie down with him, sing some quiet songs or just stroke his back. When he is calm, give him some time to play by himself.</li>
	<li>If your child says she does not want to do a particular activity, see whether you can find out what she does not like about that particular activity. It is best to talk to her later on, when she is calm.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are seeing behaviour problems because your child is overstimulated or stressed, it is almost always helpful to tackle them by changing the environment.</p>

<h2>School-age children: dealing with overstimulation</h2>

<p>At this age, children can start calming themselves down. Here are some ideas to help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Help your child put into words the feelings that he’s expressing through behaviour. For example, ‘I can see that you’re upset’, ‘I can see that you’re feeling overwhelmed’.</li>
	<li>Suggest that your child goes to a quiet place if she is tired or cranky from overdoing it. For example, she could read or listen to quiet music in her bedroom.</li>
	<li>Talk with your child about which activities he finds most interesting or valuable. He might need to think about letting some activities go if he is finding he has too much to cope with.</li>
	<li>Look into mindfulness strategies for your child. You might be able to find some that you and your child could practise together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child needs enough time during the week to do homework, spend time with family, socialise with friends and just be by herself.</p>

<h2>Finding the right amount of stimulation</h2>

<p>There is no one ‘right’ answer to how much stimulation is too much, because every child is different. Different children can cope with different amounts of excitement. Some children cope with stimulating environments better than others.</p>

<p>Let your child be the guide, and remember that moderation is best.</p>

<p>For <strong>babies and young children</strong>, it is a good idea to give your child some time each day to spend quietly playing or resting, apart from sleep time.</p>

<p>Your <strong>school-age child</strong> will probably benefit most from one or two extracurricular activities that he is really interested in. Sport, music and other clubs can be a fantastic way to develop skills, make new friends and pursue interests. But too much time spent on organised after-school activities might mean your child misses out on time to relax and entertain himself.</p>

<p>The ability to occupy yourself is an important life skill. By encouraging it, you help your child on her journey towards becoming an independent adult.</p>",191,6,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"921, 386, 381, 81, 361, 2566",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/behaviour/common-concerns/overstimulation"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/behaviour/common-concerns/overstimulation</a></p>",en,published
661,Stomach ache,"Stomach pain can have many different causes, including wind, infections, constipation, food intolerances, appendicitis and so on. See yourdoctor if your child’s stomach pain is severe or doesn’t go away, or if your child also seems generally unwell.
If your child has a sore tummy, encourage them to rest and drink enough fluids.","<h1>About stomach pain or ache</h1>

<p>Stomach pain in children is very often caused by wind and indigestion, neither of which is serious.</p>

<p>A sore tummy might also be a sign of infections like food poisoning, gastroenteritis, pneumonia or urinary tract infections.</p>

<p>Anxiety or stress can cause ‘butterflies’ in the tummy.</p>

<p>Severe stomach pain might be caused by more serious or surgical illnesses like appendicitis or intussusception, which is when part of the stomach slides into or over itself.</p>

<p>Tummy pain that keeps coming back might be associated with constipation, food intolerances or inflammation in the gut.</p>

<p>Sometimes stomach pain is called <strong>functional abdominal pain</strong>. In these cases, your child’s stomach more sensitive to normal triggers like gas.</p>

<h2>Symptoms related to stomach pain</h2>

<p>The symptoms that come with stomach pain vary depending on what’s causing the stomach pain.</p>

<p>For example, if the stomach pain comes with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, the problem could be gastroenteritis or food poisoning.</p>

<p>Cramps and general pain might be associated with excess wind and bloating.</p>

<p>Tummy pain that doesn’t go away could be constipation or a urinary tract infection. Children with a urinary tract infection, might also have pain when doing a wee, be doing more wees than normal, and might have a fever, be vomiting and feel irritable.</p>

<p>Tummy pain might also be associated with pneumonia or a viral infection. In this case, your child will probably also have a fever, cough and possibly a sore throat.</p>

<p>A sore tummy is more likely to be a sign of something serious if it wakes your child up, or if the pain is in a specific area of the abdomen, away from your child’s belly button. For example, in appendicitis, the pain is usually sharp, and the pain often starts in the middle then moves to the lower right section of the abdomen. Your child might also have fever, loss of appetite and vomiting.</p>

<p>With all types of stomach pain, there’s a risk that your child will become dehydrated. You should watch for signs of dehydration, including sunken eyes, less wee than usual, lethargy and weight loss. If your child shows these signs, make sure they're drinking enough fluids.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about stomach pain?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see your doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>complains of severe pain in the tummy or it wakes them from sleep</li>
	<li>has tummy pain that doesn’t go away, or that keeps coming and going</li>
	<li>is unwell or has a fever in addition to the pain</li>
	<li>complains that the pain gets worse when they move</li>
	<li>has diarrhoea or vomiting that doesn’t go away</li>
	<li>is losing weight or has pain that affects their energy levels.</li>
	<li>If you think your child has swallowed something poisonous.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Take your child to a hospital emergency department straight away if your child has:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>bloody or bright green vomit</li>
	<li>blood in his poo.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment for stomach pain</h2>

<p>To help your child feel more comfortable, you can give paracetamol in the recommended dose.  </p>

<p>It’s also important to make sure that your child gets enough fluids and plenty of rest. Distracting your child from the pain and using relaxation strategies can help too.</p>

666,Child development: the first five years,"Development is how your child grows physically and emotionally and learns to communicate, think and socialise. In the first five years of life, your child’s brain develops more and faster than at any other time in his life. Your relationship with your child is one of the most important influences on your child’s learning and development. In the early years, your child’s main way of learning and developing is through play.","<h1><strong>About early child development</strong></h1>

<p>Development is the term used to describe the changes in your child’s <strong>physical growth, as well as her/his ability to learn the social, emotional, behaviour, thinking and communication skills </strong>she/he needs for life. All of these areas are linked, and each depends on and influences the others.</p>

<p>In the first five years of life, <strong>your child’s brain develops more and faster </strong>than at any other time in her/his life. Your child’s early experiences – her/his relationships and the things she/he sees, hears, touches, smells and tastes – stimulate her/his brain, creating millions of connections. This is when the foundations for learning, health and behaviour throughout life are laid down. Children also develop a sense of gender identity by the age of three which further intensifies as they grow older. Parents act as a critical influencer of gender socialization during early childhood.</p>

<p>Babies are born ready to learn, and their brains develop through use. So your child needs a stimulating and caring environment with lots of different activities that give her/him plenty of ways to play and learn, and lots of chances to practise what she/he’s learning.</p>

<h2><strong>Relationships: the foundation for child development</strong></h2>

<p>Children’s relationships affect all areas and stages of their development.</p>

<p>This is because relationships are experiences. In fact, <strong>relationships are the most important experiences in your child’s environment </strong>because they teach her/him the most about the world around her/him. They also shape the way she/he sees the world.</p>

<p>Through relationships, your child learns whether the world is safe and secure, whether she/he is loved, who loves her/him, what happens when she/he cries, laughs or makes a face, and much more.</p>

<p>Your child also learns by seeing relationships between other people – for example, how you behave towards your partner, and how your partner behaves towards you. This learning is the basis for the development of your child’s communication, behaviour, social and other skills.</p>

<p><strong>Your child’s most important relationship is with you. </strong>Relationships with other family members, carers, including early childhood educators, and other children, are also very important.</p>

<p>A loving, nurturing relationship helps you and your child learn a little more about each other every day. As your child grows and develops, her/his needs will change. You will learn more about what she/he needs and how you can meet these needs.</p>

<h2><strong>Play: how child development happens</strong></h2>

<p>In the early years, your child’s main way of learning and developing is through play.</p>

<p>Play is fun for your child and gives her/him an opportunity to explore, observe, experiment, solve problems and learn from her/his mistakes. She/he will need your support and encouragement to do this. But it is important to try to find a balance between helping your child and letting her/him try things on her/his own, which means she/he might sometimes make mistakes. Finding out for herself/himself about how the world works is a big part of your child’s learning.</p>

<p>Lots of time spent playing, talking, listening and interacting with you helps your child learn the skills she/he needs for life. These skills include communicating, thinking, solving problems, moving and being with other people and children. It must be noted that parents and carers should engage in the full range of play activities regardless of gender of the child as this will facilitate development of holistic skills in the child.</p>

<p>Play is a great relationship builder. Spending time playing with your child sends a simple message – you are important to me. This message helps your child learn about who she/he is and where she/he fits in the world.</p>

<h2><strong>Other things that shape child development</strong></h2>

<p>Your child’s genes and other factors like healthy eating, physical activity, health and the neighbourhood you live in also have a big impact on your child’s wellbeing and development.</p>

<p><strong>Healthy eating</strong><br />
Healthy food gives your child the energy and nutrients she/he needs to grow and develop. It helps develop her/his sense of taste. Healthy family food and eating patterns in the early years can set up healthy eating habits for life.</p>

<p>Your child learns about food choices from you, so the best way to help your child develop healthy eating habits is to let her/him see you preparing, eating and enjoying healthy food yourself.</p>

<p>Parents and carers should also remember that the nutritional requirements of all children are the same regardless of gender.</p>

<p><strong>Physical activity</strong><br />
Being physically active gets your child moving. It develops her/his motor skills, helps her/him think and gives her/him an opportunity to explore her/his world. These skills are essential for all children regardless of gender. So your child needs plenty of opportunities for active play, both inside and outside. If you are active yourself, your child is likely to follow your lead.</p>

<p><strong>Health</strong><br />
Your child’s health can influence her/his development. All children get sick at some point – for example, with coughs and colds, ear aches or gastroenteritis. These minor childhood illnesses generally will not cause any long-term problems with development.</p>

<p>But chronic or long-term conditions can affect your child’s development. These include developmental and learning disabilities like deafness, blindness or autism spectrum disorder as well as conditions like cystic fibrosis, cancer or cerebral palsy.</p>

<p>If your child has a chronic condition, it is a good idea to talk with your doctor, nurse or other medical specialist – for example, a paediatrician. These health professionals can tell you about how your child’s condition might affect development and how you can best support your child.</p>

<p>Parents and carers should also remember that all children require good quality, speedy and professional health services, regardless of gender.</p>

<p><strong>Neighbourhood and local community</strong><br />
Your neighbourhood and local community influence your child’s development. For example, your child’s development is supported by positive relationships with friends and neighbours, and access to playgrounds, parks, shops and local services like child care, playgroups, kindergartens, schools, health centres and libraries.</p>

<h2><strong>Developing at different rates</strong></h2>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates.</p>

<p>Some parents worry about when their child will walk, and others worry about when their baby’s first teeth will appear. Most skills develop in the same order, but the age they happen might vary even for children in the same family.</p>

<p>If you are wondering about whether your child’s development is ‘normal’, it might help to remember that development is different for every child. For example, the typical age range for children to start walking is 8-18 months. So if your child is not walking at 14 months, that is okay.</p>

<p>If you really feel that something is not quite right with your child’s development, trust your instinct. See your doctor or nurse. </p>

<h2><strong>Being a parent</strong></h2>

<p>Whether you are raising a child as a parent, grandparent, kinship carer or foster parent, you are always learning. We all make mistakes and learn through experience. It is okay to feel confident about what you know. And it is also okay to admit you do not know and ask questions.</p>

<p>Your own <strong>physical and mental health is an important part of raising a child</strong>. But with all the focus on looking after a child or baby, lots of parents and carers forget or run out of time to look after themselves. Looking after yourself will help you with the understanding, patience, imagination and energy you need to raise your child.</p>",7156,6,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"81, 196, 231, 516, 936",,1,0,"<p>Article taken from: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/development/understanding-development/development-first-five-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/development/understanding-development/development-first-five-years</a></p>",en,published
671,Food poisoning,"Food poisoning is an illness that can cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Food poisoning and is caused by eating poorly stored or cooked food that contains germs, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Follow good food hygiene practices to prevent food poisoning.","<h1>What is food poisoning?</h1>

<p>Food poisoning is a type of gastroenteritis.</p>

<p>Food poisoning happens when germs grow in foods like salads, meat, chicken, seafood, eggs or cream that has gone off. The germs grow because the food is undercooked, poorly reheated or not refrigerated properly. Germs can also grow when the food is prepared with dirty hands or dirty equipment.</p>

<p>The bacteria that cause food poisoning include, <em>Staphylococcus</em>, Campylobacter,<em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Escherichia coli</em>. Some viruses such as norovirus, parasites and also toxins produced by bacteria can also cause food poisoning.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of food poisoning</h2>

<p>Symptoms might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>nausea or vomiting</li>
	<li>stomach pain and cramps</li>
	<li>wind</li>
	<li>loose poo or diarrhoea, sometimes with blood</li>
	<li>headache</li>
	<li>fever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Food poisoning can happen within hours to a few days after eating bad food. It often takes 24-48 hours for the symptoms of food poisoning to settle down.</p>

<p>Symptoms of foods poisoning can be more severe in babies than in older children and teenagers.</p>

<p>If your child has the symptoms of food poisoning, you should watch your child for signs of dehydration.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about food poisoning?</h2>

<p>See your doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has diarrhoea that goes on for more than a few days</li>
	<li>has bloody diarrhoea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take your child to a hospital emergency department straight away if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child has severe stomach pain and vomiting and can’t keep any fluid down</li>
	<li>your child isn’t drinking and has signs of dehydration, including little or no wee, weight loss, tiredness and extreme thirst</li>
	<li>your child has symptoms of food poisoning and is less than one year old</li>
	<li>you’re worried about your child being extremely unwell.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment for food poisoning</h2>

<p>Most cases of food poisoning are mild, and your child won’t need any specific treatment.</p>

<p>Antibiotics are not usually needed or recommended but may be used for some types of foodborne illness.</p>

<p>Make sure your child drinks enough fluids. Little sips of oral rehydration fluid at regular intervals is best. This will help to prevent dehydration.</p>

<p>If your child is hungry, you can give him whatever he feels like eating.</p>

<p>Your child might not feel like eating, but don’t stop food for more than 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Preventing food poisoning</h2>

<p><strong>The first step to preventing food poisoning is always washing your hands thoroughly before eating and handling food.</strong></p>

<p>When you’re <strong>preparing food</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly</li>
	<li>check that meats are fresh and don’t smell bad</li>
	<li>cook meat and eggs well</li>
	<li>don’t prepare raw meat and vegetables on the same surface</li>
	<li>don’t prepare food for others to eat if you’re sick.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you’re <strong>reheating food</strong>, do so thoroughly.</p>

<p>Make sure you <strong>store food properly</strong> and at the right temperature so it’s protected from contamination. And remember to check the use-by or best-before date on packaging before eating.</p>

<p>When you’re <strong>eating out</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>check the cleanliness of the restaurant or takeaway food shop</li>
	<li>consider whether staff follow good hygiene practices</li>
	<li>check that food is being stored and served at the correct temperature</li>
	<li>check that meat is cooked right through</li>
	<li>eat takeaway food within a few hours or put it in the fridge as soon as possible.</li>

676,Faecal incontinence,Faecal incontinence is when children who are past the age of toilet training regularly do poos in places other than the toilet. They can’t control when and where the poo comes. It can be very upsetting for children and parents.,"<h1>Causes of faecal incontinence</h1>

<p>Fecal incontinence is the inability to control bowel movements, causing stool (feces) to leak unexpectedly from the rectum. Fecal incontinence ranges from an occasional leakage of stool while passing gas to a complete loss of bowel control.</p>

<p>If your child has been constipated for a long time, poo builds up in his rectum, which can cause the rectum to stretch. Your child might lose the urge to go the toilet because his rectum always feels stretched. Then liquid poo might overflow around the old, stuck poo, without your child feeling it or meaning to let it go.</p>

<p>Emotional issues, like stress from premature or forceful toilet training or the birth of a sibling, might also lead to faecal incontinence.</p>

<p>Other causes of faecal incontinence include rare neurological and muscle disorders and abnormalities of the anus.</p>

<p>Faecal incontinence is also called soiling or encopresis.</p>

<p>Faecal incontinence is accidental and beyond your child’s control. But it can be difficult to live with, and it’s normal if you find it challenging or upsetting. If this sounds like you, talk to your doctor about getting support.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of faecal incontinence</h2>

<p>Faecal incontinence can range from ‘skid marks’ to larger bits of poo in your child’s underwear.</p>

<p>Aside from pooing in places other than the toilet – usually in her underwear – your child might also have symptoms of constipation. These include pain when doing a poo, which can mean she tries to avoid going to the toilet. She might also have tummy pains that come and go, and she might go for long periods between poos.</p>

<p>It’s common for children with faecal incontinence also to have daytime or night-time wetting.</p>

<p>About 30-50% of children with faecal incontinence have emotional or behaviour problems too.</p>

<p>All children achieve bowel control at their own rate. Faecal incontinence isn’t generally considered a medical condition unless your child is at least four years old.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>When to see your doctor</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if your child is four years or older and has persistent faecal incontinence or constipation.</p>

<p>The doctor is going to make sure that there is nor neurological or muscle damage and to suggest a plan for overcomung this problem.</p>

<h2>Treatment for faecal incontinence or soiling</h2>

<p>The treatment for faecal incontinence depends on the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>If chronic constipation is the main cause, your doctor will help you work out a treatment plan based on using laxative medications and establishing good bowel habits.</p>

<p>You can help your child get into good bowel habits by encouraging him to sit on the toilet regularly and push. It’s good if he can do this for five minutes about 20-30 minutes after he finishes eating breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>

<p>If your child has behaviour problems associated with faecal incontinence, she might need counselling, and group or individual psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it’s treated, faecal incontinence usually goes away in most children</p>",8466,2,"57,58",59,60,"946, 951, 956, 961, 931, 306",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/health-daily-care/toileting/faecal-incontinence"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/health-daily-care/toileting/faecal-incontinence</a></p>",en,published
681,Passing wind or flatulence,"Flatulence, or passing wind, is normal and necessary. Your child usually doesn’t need treatment for it. If your child is passing wind a lot and also has a sore tummy and other symptoms, you might need to see your doctor. If certain foods give your child a lot of wind, try cutting back on them in your child’s diet.","<h2>What is flatulence?</h2>

<p>Flatulence in babies and children is gas from your child’s digestive system leaving his body through his bottom. It’s also called passing wind, farting – and many other things as well!</p>

<p>Flatulence can happen when you eat foods that are high in fibre like beans or carbonated (fizzy) drinks. Wind can also be caused by swallowing air – for example, your child might get gassy when sucking on an empty bottle, or when she cries.</p>

<p>Wind can sometimes be a sign of lactose intolerance and other food intolerances. Some gastro infections, coeliac disease or irritable bowel syndrome may be accompanied by increased flatulence.</p>

<p>Your child might also have more gas in his bowels if he has constipation or diarrhoea.</p>

<h2>Symptoms related to flatulence</h2>

<p>If your child has flatulence or wind, she might sometimes have stomach pain and bloating too. This can happen when the gas builds up in your child’s intestines and your child can’t get rid of it – for example, if your child has diarrhoea or constipation.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about flatulence?</h2>

<p>Take your child to see your doctor if your child has a lot of flatulence or<strong> wind and other worrying symptomes</strong> such as:</p>

<h2>Treatment for flatulence</h2>

<p><strong>Your child doesn’t usually need treatment for flatulence or wind.</strong></p>

<p>But if you notice there are certain foods that seem to give your child a lot of flatulence, you could try to cut back on them in her diet. These foods might include beans, onions, cabbage, peas, broccoli, legumes, fizzy drinks, artificial sweeteners and chewing gum. It’s a very good idea to talk to your doctor or a dietitian if you’re thinking about big changes to your child’s diet.</p>

<p>You might also want to check that your child isn’t eating or drinking too quickly and swallowing too much air.</p>

<p>If your child has a lot of flatulence as well as other symptoms, your doctor might order laboratory tests.</p>

<p>If your child has a lot of flatulence, encourage him to sit on the potty or go to the toilet to do a poo, without delaying or holding on. This helps to set up good toilet habits and avoid constipation.</p>",9016,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"966, 971, 911, 931, 926",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/wind"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/wind</a></p>",en,published
686,Constipation,"Constipation is when your child has hard poo, large poo or trouble pushing poo out. Children with constipation often don’t do poos regularly.","<h1>Causes of constipation in children</h1>

<p>Constipation can happen for several reasons.</p>

<p>Your child might be holding poos in because he’s too busy playing, because it hurts to do a poo (or has hurt before), or because he doesn’t want to use the toilets at his preschool or school.</p>

<p>Constipation might also happen if your child isn’t eating enough fibre, or because of an illness that has made your child eat and drink less.</p>

<p>These situations can all lead to a build-up of poo in the bowel. When this happens, the poo gets too hard for your child to push out easily.</p>

<p>There are some underlying medical conditions that might cause constipation in children, but these aren’t common.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of constipation in children</h2>

<p>A normal poo should be easy to push out and look like a sausage.</p>

<p>But if your child is constipated and her poo is hard to push out, she might feel pain and discomfort when she’s trying to do a poo or doing one. This might make her avoid going to the toilet.</p>

<p>Hard poo might overstretch your child’s anus and cause small, superficial tears, which might lead to pain and bleeding.</p>

<p>Your child might also have tummy pains that come and go. He might show ‘holding on’ behaviour like rocking or fidgeting, crossing his legs or refusing to sit on the toilet. He might also seem generally cranky.</p>

<p>If your child has been constipated for a long time, she might poo in her pants without meaning to. It could be a small or large amount of poo and can happen at any time of the day. This is called soiling or faecal incontinence.</p>

<p>Faecal incontinence happens because the hard poo is stuck and stretches the rectum. Your child might then lose the urge to go the toilet because his rectum always feels stretched. Liquid poo might overflow around the old hard poo, without your child feeling it or meaning to let it go.</p>

<p>There’s a big range of normal when it comes to how often children do a poo. Some children go 2-3 times a day, and other children go twice a week.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about constipation in children</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you need to give your child a laxative more than a few times a year</li>
	<li>your child’s constipation doesn’t get better after you give her a laxative</li>
	<li>your child hasn’t done a poo for five days</li>
	<li>your child poos in her pants without meaning to</li>
	<li>your child has constipation and also fever, vomiting, blood in her poo or weight loss</li>
	<li>your child has painful cracks in the skin around her anus</li>
	<li>your child has constipation and you’re worried she isn’t eating or drinking enough.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment for constipation</h2>

<p>Your child needs <strong>healthy bowel habits</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Diet</strong><br />
The first step towards healthy bowel habits is diet. A healthy diet that has enough fibre  helps to prevent constipation. Foods that are high in fibre include wholegrain breads and cereals, fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p><strong>Regular toileting</strong><br />
If your child is constipated, encourage him to get into the habit of sitting on the toilet regularly and pushing. It’s good if he can do this for five minutes about 20-30 minutes after he finishes eating breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>

<p>It can help if your child has a footstool or box to put her feet on while she sits on the toilet. Get her to put her feet flat, knees apart, and lean forward slightly while pushing.</p>

<p>You can also teach your child to be aware of and respond to his body’s urge to poo. One way to do this is by starting a sticker or reward chart to praise your child for going to the toilet.</p>

<p><strong>Laxatives</strong><br />
You might need to give your child a laxative if she’s constipated, so she can pass the hard poo without pain.</p>

<p>Prune juice is a mild natural laxative that works in some children. If this doesn’t work, you should see your doctor.</p>

<p>Possible laxative medications include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>osmotic laxatives like lactulose, polyethylene glycol which increase the water in your child’s poo and soften it</li>
	<li>liquid paraffin oil, which softens and lubricates the poo</li>
	<li>stimulants like Senekot® or Dulcolax SP® drops, which stimulate the bowel to get rid of the poo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some children with chronic constipation will need to keep taking laxative medications for several months. <strong>Your doctor will let you know</strong> about the appropriate course of treatment.</p>

<h2>Constipation in babies</h2>

<p><strong>What’s normal?</strong><br />
It’s common for many babies to go red in the face and strain when doing a normal poo.</p>

<p>In babies under six months, how often they do a poo depends on what they’re fed.</p>

<p>Breastfed babies might poo up to five times a day, or only once every five days. Their poo is soft and yellow or mustard coloured.</p>

<p>Formula-fed babies usually poo 1-2 times per day. Their poo is firmer and more green-brown.</p>

<p>Your baby might be constipated if his poo is dry and crumbly or like pellets, and doing a poo seems to cause him pain and discomfort.</p>

<p>Some babies are constipated because they didn't  get enough breastmilk or because the milk formula isn’t made up correctly and doesn’t have enough water in it. </p>

<p>If you think your baby is constipated, and there is no rapid improvement following simple measures such as adding prune juice, see your doctor to make sure that is no underlying problem.</p>",9011,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"976, 931, 926, 911, 906, 306, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/poos-wees-nappies/constipation"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/poos-wees-nappies/constipation</a></p>",en,published
691,Speech (sound) disorders,"Most young children have some trouble with speech. But some speech troubles can be a sign of speech (sound) disorders. Children might need help for speech disorders if they sound immature, do not pronounce words as you would expect, or get frustrated about speaking. If you’re concerned about your child’s speech development, talk with a GP or child and family health nurse or your child’s teacher.","<h2>About speech and speech development</h2>

<p>Speech is the ability to use your lips, tongue and other parts of your mouth to produce sounds.</p>

<p>For speech, children need to understand different sounds and the rules for putting those sounds together in their own language.</p>

<p>Most children master the following sounds at the following ages:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>around<strong> 3 years</strong>: b, p, m, n, h, d, k, g, ng (as in ‘sing’), t, w, f, y</li>
	<li>around <strong>4-5 years</strong>: f, sh, zh, ch, j, s, and cluster sounds tw, kw, gl, bl</li>
	<li>around <strong>6 years</strong>: l, r, v, and cluster sounds pl, kl, kr, fl, tr, st, dr, br, fr, gr, sn, sk, sw, sp, str, spl</li>
	<li>around <strong>7-8 years</strong>: th, z, and cluster sounds sm, sl, thr, skw, spr, skr.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most children make mistakes in their speech during the first few years of speech development. But by about three years, most children can be understood by their main caregivers, siblings and peers.</p>

<h2>Spotting speech disorders</h2>

<p>If you are worried that your child might have a speech disorder, think about <strong>how often people who do not know your child have trouble understanding what your child says</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>When a child is two</strong>, an unfamiliar person should understand about half to three-quarters of what the child is saying.</p>

<p><strong>When a child is three and older</strong>, an unfamiliar person should understand the child most of the time, even though the child will probably still say some sounds and words differently from adults.</p>

<p>Some speech disorders happen when a child has a physical problem (like a cleft palate) that makes it hard for the child to create the sounds of speech. Others have trouble because of deafness or a hearing impairment. But most children have no specific reason for their speech disorder.</p>

<p>Speech disorders are different from language delay. Children with speech disorders can understand words and sentences well and form sentences correctly. Children with language delay might use very few words for their age or not understand what you say.</p>

<h2>When to seek help for speech disorders</h2>

<p>If your child has a speech disorder, you will probably need help from a professional.</p>

<p>It is best to consider seeking help if your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>sounds very immature for her age – that is, she uses only a few speech sounds or patterns</li>
	<li>does not pronounce words the way you would expect for her age</li>
	<li>gets frustrated about speaking – for example, she gets upset when she is not understood, has to repeat sounds or she stutters</li>
	<li>has hearing loss.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to seek help for your child’s speech</h2>

<p>If you have any worries about your child’s speech development, it is a very good idea to talk with your doctor, paediatrician or nurse or your child’s teacher.</p>

<p>These professionals might refer you to a speech pathologist, or you can visit a privately practising speech pathologist yourself. You might be referred to an audiologist if there is a possibility that your child’s speech problems are caused by a hearing impairment.</p>

<h2>Helping your child’s speech development</h2>

<p>It is normal for young children to pronounce words differently from adults. There is no need to correct them every time they make a mistake – this can be frustrating for everyone.</p>

<p>If you want to encourage your child, <strong>gentle reminders</strong> can help your child pronounce words the right way. For example, if your child says, ‘I saw the tat’, you could reply, ‘Where was the cat? What was the cat doing?’ This involves repeating the missing or different sound – ‘cat’ – with a slight emphasis.</p>

<p>If <strong>your child’s speech is really hard to understand</strong>, here are some ideas for helping your child to communicate:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Ask your child to show you what he is talking about – for example, ask him to point to the thing that he wants.</li>
	<li>Ask simple questions to get more information about what your child is trying to say – for example, ‘Are you telling me about something that happened today? Did it happen at kindergarten?’ Then let your child tell you the rest of the story.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to talk slowly. Let your child know you are listening, and that she has all the time in the world to tell you.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What not to worry about with speech development</h2>

<p>Although children might be able to make the right sounds, they might not use them correctly in words in the early years. And while they are learning to talk, children simplify adult speech to make it easier to say.</p>

<p>This means <strong>you probably do not need to worry</strong> if your young child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>substitutes sounds in words (‘dod’ instead of ‘dog’)</li>
	<li>drops sounds from the end of words (‘ha’ instead of ‘hat’)</li>
	<li>simplifies difficult sound combinations (‘side’ instead of ‘slide’)</li>
	<li>drops syllables (‘boon’ instead of ‘balloon’).</li>
</ul>

<p>It is okay if your three-year-old is still doing all of these things, as long as you can understand what he is saying. But if your child is making lots of errors and you cannot understand what he is saying, it is a good idea to see a speech pathologist.</p>",5551,6,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"526, 196, 201, 626, 981",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/development/language-development/speech-disorders"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/development/language-development/speech-disorders</a></p>",en,published
696,Language development: 1-2 years,"Language development in children aged 1-2 years is amazing. Your child will start to understand what you say to him. And by the year’s end, you might even understand some of what he says to you! Here are some of the things you might expect at this age.","<h2>Vocabulary and language development in children 1-2 years</h2>

<p>At 1-2 years, your child will learn to use and understand more words and more types of words. At first she’ll understand mostly nouns – for example, ‘dog’, ‘bus’ and ‘couch’. Eventually she will understand a few verbs – for example, ‘eat’ and ‘run’. Adjectives come next – for example, ‘big’ and ‘blue’.</p>

<h2>Understanding and language development in children 1-2 years</h2>

<p>At around <strong>12 months</strong>, your child will understand the names of things nearby. For example, he will understand the words for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>common objects like ‘cup’ or ‘doll’</li>
	<li>body parts like ‘tummy’ or ‘toe’</li>
	<li>clothes like ‘sock’ or ‘hat’.</li>
</ul>

<p>But your child will use the same word to refer to different things. For example, she might call all animals ‘doggie’.</p>

<p>At around <strong>15 months</strong>, your child will point to things further away and ask you to name them.</p>

<p>At around <strong>18 months</strong>, your child will refer to himself by name. A few months later, he will begin to understand and use ‘I’ to refer to himself. This is when he starts to realise he is a separate person with his own ideas.</p>

<p>During this year, your child will understand:</p>

<ul>
	<li>some familiar phrases like ‘Give me a kiss’</li>
	<li>simple instructions like ‘Stop that’</li>
	<li>very, very simple explanations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child will start being able to identify parts of her body and point to objects when asked – for example, ‘Show me the truck’.</p>

<h2>Using words and sentences</h2>

<p>Language development includes learning to use words and sentences.</p>

<p>At around <strong>12 months</strong>, your child will start using words to communicate with you. His babble will start turning into real words. Your child might also enjoy saying the same word over and over.</p>

<p>Your child will begin to put two words together as she nears <strong>two years</strong> – for example, ‘mummy car’, ‘me go’ or ‘sock foot’. Words like ‘the’ and ‘is’ will be missing in these two-word sentences. She’ll use only a few descriptive words at this age – for example, ‘big’, ‘red’ or ‘sunny’. Her word combinations will consist mainly of nouns and some verbs (‘dog eat’, ‘car go’).</p>

<h2>Pronunciation</h2>

<p>Your child will use a <strong>range of speech sounds</strong>, but it is normal for him to pronounce words differently from the way adults say them. For example, he might say ‘tar’ instead of ‘car’, or he might leave off the ends of words altogether, like ‘ca’ instead of ‘cat’.</p>

<p>Your child’s pronunciation will often be hard to understand. But by the time she is two years old, someone who does not know her well should be able to understand about half of what she says.</p>

<h2>Conversation and communication</h2>

<p>Learning to have a conversation is part of language development.</p>

<p>Your child might <strong>draw attention to something </strong>by saying ‘Wassat’ (‘What’s that?’) or pointing. And he knows that if you point to something and say ‘Look’, you are showing him something.</p>

<p>Your child will answer simple questions, and she will also understand the difference in your tone when you ask a question or make a statement. And she will know what it means when you say ‘no’ or ‘not’.</p>

<p>Your child will try to make it easier for you to understand him by <strong>combining words, gestures and sounds</strong> and by changing the tone of his voice.</p>

<p>And your child will enjoy imitating the actions of people around her, and start to understand how to get attention from others by ‘showing off’.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates. Some children who seem slow to start talking often catch up in a few years. The information in this article is offered as a guide only. You know your child best, so if you are at all concerned about your child’s language development, speak with your doctor, paediatrician or nurse.</p>",5581,6,"49,50",59,60,"196, 201, 526, 266",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/language-development/language-1-2-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/language-development/language-1-2-years</a></p>",en,published
701,Language development: 2-3 years,"What is happening with language development in children between the ages of two and three years? Your toddler’s vocabulary will probably double. She will speak in longer sentences, and she might play and talk at the same time. Strangers will probably be able to understand most of what she says by the time she is three.","<h2>Vocabulary and language development in children at 2-3 years</h2>

<p>At this age, your toddler’s vocabulary expands quickly – he might even learn new words each day. In general, your toddler understands more words than he can use.</p>

<p>Your child will use lots of <strong>nouns </strong>– for example, ‘baby’, ‘friend’, ‘car’ and ‘boat’. You will also hear more and more word types too, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>verbs – for example, ‘play’, ‘go’, ‘walk’</li>
	<li>adjectives – for example, ‘wet’, ‘sore’, ‘cloudy’</li>
	<li>pronouns – for example, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘I’, ‘you’</li>
	<li>location words – for example, ‘in’, ‘on’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child will start using words like ‘more’ and ‘most’, as well as words to make questions like ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘where’.</p>

<p>And your child will start to say ‘me’, ‘mine’ and ‘you’. By three, she will understand the difference between ‘mine’ and ‘yours’.</p>

<h2>Sentences and grammar in language development</h2>

<p>As part of language development, your child will begin to use <strong>two-word sentences at around two years</strong>. By age three, he will be able to use sentences with three or more words – for example, ‘Mummy get in car’, ‘Me go too’ or ‘Put sock on foot’.</p>

<p>You will start to hear grammar and more structured sentences. For example, instead of ‘I go’, your child might say ‘I’m going’. You will also hear her use the past tense – for example, ‘walked’, ‘jumped’. And she will start using plurals like ‘cats’ or ‘horses’.</p>

<p>Your child might not always get it right when he uses plurals and past tense. For example, he might say ‘foots’ for ‘feet’, or ‘goed’ instead of ‘went’. This is because he is <strong>still trying to figure out how language works</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding and language development</h2>

<p>Language development includes your child understanding more and more of what is said to her and how it’s said.</p>

<p>Your child will <strong>understand one-step and two-step instructions</strong>, as long as they are about things he already knows – for example, ‘Pick up your toys and put them in the box’ or ‘Come over here and have some apple’. He might still find it hard to follow instructions about unfamiliar objects or tasks.</p>

<p>Your child will begin to answer questions from adults about ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘where’, but she might not yet understand how to answer ‘why’ and ‘how’ questions.</p>

<p>Your child can tell from the tone of your voice if you’re happy, affectionate or angry.</p>

<p>If your child is struggling to do something, he knows how to ask for your help.</p>

<p>And your child will understand household routines and guess what is going to happen next in a routine. For example, if you tell her to put her boots on, she knows she is going to the park.</p>

<h2>Pronunciation in language development</h2>

<p>By three, your child will <strong>use most of the speech sounds in his words</strong>, but he might still pronounce words differently from adults. For example, even though he can say the sounds ‘b’ and ‘l’, he might have trouble combining them together in ‘blue’. Some difficult sounds like ‘z’, ‘sh’, ‘f’, ‘v’, ‘r’, and ‘th’ might still be hard for your child to say.</p>

<p>By the time your child is three years old, unfamiliar people will be able to understand about three-quarters of what she is saying.</p>

<h2>Developing conversation skills</h2>

<p>Your child will <strong>start to get the hang of speaking in turn</strong>, and he might be able to have a short conversation with you.</p>

<p>Your child will talk about things that have happened during the day. With your help, she might be able to put together a simple story – for example, your toddler might say ‘I go shop’.  You might respond, ‘And what did you do at the shop?’ She will reply ‘Buy lollies’. By age three, she might be able to tell a simple ‘made-up’ story based on experiences she’s had, but she will probably leave out lots of detail.</p>

<p>Your child will talk about people and objects not present – for example, ‘Grandma at the shops’, ‘My ball in tree’.</p>

<p>And your child will start talking the same way you or other close adults talk. You might even hear your child say certain words the way you do. He might begin to ‘boss’ other people around, particularly younger children!</p>

<h2>Play and language development</h2>

<p>Your child will be able to play and talk by age three – for example, giving voices to the toys she’s playing with. She will also begin to play in groups with other children, sharing toys and taking turns.</p>

<p>You might hear your child <strong>playing with language</strong> through rhyming, singing and listening to stories. He might use an overly loud or soft voice when speaking.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates. The information in this article is offered as a guide only, and you know your child better than anyone else. Speak to your doctor, paediatrician or nurse if you are concerned about your child’s language development, if her language development seems to have stopped, or if she has lost a language skill she once had. If your health professional does not have concerns about your child, but you still do, it is okay to get another opinion.</p>",561,6,"50,51",59,60,"526, 196, 266, 201, 76, 986",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/language-development/language-2-3-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/language-development/language-2-3-years</a></p>",en,published
706,Sex education and talking with children about sex: 0-8 years,"Early conversations about sex can send the message that sex and sexuality are healthy parts of life.
It Is important for children to feel okay about coming to you for reliable, honest information.
Young children might want to know about how girls’ and boys’ bodies are different and where babies come from.
Explain things at a level children can understand and make sure they have the facts.","<h2>Talking about sex and sexuality with young children</h2>

<p>It is <strong>never too early to talk </strong>with your child about sex. Talking about sex, sexuality and bodies from when your child is young can help your child understand that sex and sexuality are healthy parts of life.</p>

<p>Open and honest conversations when your child is young can <strong>make later conversations easier</strong>. And these early conversations also lay the groundwork for children to make healthier choices about sex when they’re older.</p>

<p>The key early message is that your child can come to you for <strong>open, honest and reliable information</strong>, and that your child should not feel scared or embarrassed to ask you about sex and sexuality.</p>

<p>And the good news is that talking about sex and sexuality <strong>is not a one-off conversation</strong> that you have to get exactly right. It is a conversation that continues and evolves as your child grows up.</p>

<p>Sexuality is not just about sex. It is also the way your child feels about their developing body. And it is how your child understands and expresses feelings of intimacy, attraction and affection for others, and how your child develops and maintains respectful relationships.</p>

<h2>Three steps for talking about sex</h2>

<p>Three basic steps can help you talk with your child about sex.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, find out what your child already knows. For example, ‘Where do you think babies come from?’ or ‘What have you heard about where babies come from?’</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, correct any misinformation and give the facts. For example, ‘No babies do not grow in their mummy’s tummy. They grow in a special place inside their mummy, called the uterus’.</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, use the conversation as an opportunity to talk about your own thoughts or feelings. For example, ‘Some people really want to have a baby when they are ready and other people are not too sure about having a baby at all’.</p>

<h2>How to talk about sex, sexuality and bodies: tips for all ages</h2>

<p>These tips can make it easier to talk with children of any age about sex.</p>

<p><strong>Explain things at your child’s level</strong><br />
Explain things at a level your child can understand. For example, six-year olds will not want a long explanation of ovulation, although they might be fascinated to know that women have very small eggs (or ova) that can make a baby. It is best to keep your explanation brief, factual and positive if you can. Your child can come back to you if they want more information.</p>

<p><strong>Use correct names for body parts</strong><br />
It is a good idea to use the correct names when you are talking about body parts – for example, penis, scrotum, testicles, vulva, vagina. It is okay to use pet names too. But using the correct names helps to send the message that talking about these parts of our bodies is healthy and okay. And if your child knows the correct names for body parts, your child will be able to communicate clearly about their body with you or people like doctors if they need to.</p>

<p><strong>Say ‘I don’t know’ if you need to</strong><br />
Your child does not need you to be an expert – your child just needs to know that they can ask you anything they need to.</p>

<p>If you do not know what to say, tell your child you are glad they asked, that you do not know the answer, and that you will look for some information and get back to them. And then make sure you do get back to your child, or you could suggest looking for more information together.</p>

<p><strong>Get all parents involved</strong><br />
It is good for both parents to get involved in discussions about sex. When both parents get involved, children learn that it is okay to talk about sex and sexuality. This can help children to feel more comfortable talking about their bodies, take responsibility for sexual feelings, and communicate in intimate relationships when they are older.</p>

<p><strong>Start a conversation</strong><br />
Some children do not ask many questions, so you might need to start a conversation. It is a good idea to think about what to say beforehand, then pick a good time to bring the subject up. For example, if someone is talking about pregnancy on TV you could say, ‘They were talking about pregnancy on the TV earlier. It got me wondering if you know what that is?’</p>

<p>Some children find it easier to talk without eye contact, so you could plan to talk while you and your child are travelling in the car.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare yourself</strong><br />
You might feel embarrassed or uncomfortable talking about sexuality, or using words like ‘penis’ or ‘vagina’ when talking about bodies. That is okay. It is a good idea to prepare yourself by thinking about what you are comfortable with and building on that. For example, if you are okay with talking about bottoms but not breasts, try using the word ‘bottom’ in conversation to start with.</p>

<p>It is important for children to know the difference between touching that is okay and touching that is not okay. Make sure your child knows that they can say ‘No!’ to any touching that they do not want and that it is always okay to tell a trusted adult about touch that is not okay. Talking with your child about sexual abuse will help keep your child safe.</p>

<h2>0-2 years: what to say about sex, sexuality and bodies</h2>

<p>You can use everyday moments to help your child learn about bodies – for example, bath time or while you are helping your child get dressed are good times to introduce the names of body parts.</p>

<h2>2-3 years: what to say about sex, sexuality and bodies</h2>

<p>Most children aged 2-3 years are very curious about their own and other children’s bodies. They will also notice that boys’ and girls’ bodies are different. Your child might ask you why or say, ‘What’s that?’ You can <strong>teach your child that every body part has a name</strong> and its own ‘job’ to do. For example, boys have a penis, and girls have a vulva.</p>

<p>You might find that looking at a book with your child is helpful. You can use the pictures to help your child learn the names for body parts and understand the differences between boys and girls.</p>

<h2>4-5 years: what to say about sex, sexuality and bodies</h2>

<p>Children aged 4-5 years often ask <strong>where babies come from</strong>. They can understand that a baby grows in a mother’s uterus, and that to make a baby you need a sperm (like a tiny seed) from a man and an ovum (like a tiny egg) from a woman.</p>

<p>If your child asks ‘Where do I come from?’ you could ask, ‘What do you think?’ This helps you work out what your child is really asking and how much your child understands. You could give a simple explanation like ‘Babies grow in a place inside their mother called the uterus’.</p>

<p>If you are pregnant your child might ask, ‘Where does the baby come out?’ Give a simple but accurate answer like ‘Your little sister is growing in my uterus. When she’s finished growing, she’ll squeeze through the birth canal, which is called the vagina’.</p>

<h2>6-8 years: what to say about sex, sexuality and bodies</h2>

<p>By six years old, many children are interested in <strong>how babies are made</strong> and might ask questions.</p>

<p>If your child asks, ‘How did the baby get into your uterus?’ ask your child what they think. This helps you understand what your child already knows. Then you can explain simply, giving as much information as you are comfortable with. For example, ‘To make a baby, a sperm from a man and an egg from a woman join together.’</p>

<p>You could explain that this happens when a man and a woman have <strong>sexual intercourse</strong>, which is when the man puts his penis inside the woman’s vagina. It is also good to explain that sexual intercourse is something that grown-ups do when they both want to, and that it is not for children.</p>

<p>You might also like to say that sometimes babies enter families in different ways like IVF, adoption, foster care or grandparent care.</p>

<p><strong>You do not have to wait for your child to ask</strong> you a question. You could start a conversation by asking, ‘Have you ever wondered how you were born and where you came from?’ Or you might see a pregnant woman and say to your child, ‘That woman has a baby growing inside her. Do you know how the baby got there?’</p>

<p>You could also read a book together about where babies come from.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to start talking to your child about puberty and how bodies change in puberty well before your child starts puberty. This could be when your child is around 6-8 years old.</p>

<p>If your child comes across sexting or pornography, stay calm. This can be an opportunity to talk with your child about what is and is not okay for children to see. And talking about these issues is one of the best ways to keep your child safe online and promote respectful online behaviour.</p>",1141,6,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"991, 266, 81, 3771",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/development/sexual-development/sex-education-children"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/development/sexual-development/sex-education-children</a></p>",en,published
711,Childhood sexual behaviour: toddlers,"Sexual behaviour is a mostly typical and healthy part of children’s development.
Toddlers might explore their own or other people’s bodies by touching, looking and talking.
The way you respond to toddler sexual behaviour depends on your values. But staying calm is very important.","<h2>Toddler sexual behaviour: what’s typical?</h2>

<p>Sexual behaviour in your toddler might be a bit confronting, especially the first time you see it. It might help to know that <strong>touching, looking at and talking about bodies</strong> is a mostly typical and healthy part of your child’s development at this age.</p>

<p>Open and honest talk about sex, bodies and relationships will help you guide your child’s behaviour now. It also lays the groundwork for future talks about sexual development, respectful relationships and sexuality. It’s never too early to start talking.</p>

<h2>Typical toddler sexual behaviour: what it looks like</h2>

<p>Your toddler might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>touch or rub his genitals</li>
	<li>show his genitals to someone else</li>
	<li>look at or touch the genitals of familiar children or adults in a fun way during play, at bath time or in the toilet</li>
	<li>repeat words, expressions and slang for toileting, body functions or body parts</li>
	<li>enjoy being nude</li>
	<li>show interest in body parts and how they work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What typical toddler sexual behaviour means</h2>

<p>The behaviour described above is typical for toddlers. Your child might behave in these ways because:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>it feels good</li>
	<li>she is learning about touch and social rules</li>
	<li>she is curious about the differences between boys’ and girls’ bodies</li>
	<li>she is working out how bodies work</li>
	<li>her vocabulary and understanding of language is developing</li>
	<li>she is trying to understand families and relationships.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some sexual behaviour and sex play is not typical and might even be a sign of something more serious. Read more about problematic sexual behaviour.</p>

<h2>How to respond to typical sexual behaviour in toddlers</h2>

<p>How you react is important, but your response depends on your values. Some parents are okay with this type of behaviour, and others are not.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to <strong>stay calm</strong>, no matter how you plan to respond.</p>

<p>You can <strong>use sexual behaviour as an opportunity to help your toddler learn</strong>. Talk with your toddler and answer his questions openly and honestly, but also at a level he can understand. For example, you could talk about public and private body parts, how girls and boys are different, or ways of talking about bodies.</p>

<p>When talking with your child, it is a good idea to <strong>use the proper words for body parts</strong> – vagina, vulva, breasts, penis, testicles and so on. This helps your child learn about her body and tell you clearly about any questions or concerns she has.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want your toddler to stop a sexual behaviour – for example, if he is loudly asking a private question in a public place. Calmly distracting your child or finding another activity for a short while can shift his attention to something else.</p>

<p>You could talk to your toddler about it later when you have privacy and time.</p>

<p>It is important that your child knows that it is okay to be curious and it is good to talk about these topics together.</p>",5586,6,"51,52",59,60,"991, 81, 266, 496, 2471",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/sexual-development/sexual-behaviour-toddlers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/sexual-development/sexual-behaviour-toddlers</a></p>",en,published
716,Relationships and child development,"A loving, stable and responsive relationship with you is fundamental to your child’s development.
Through relationships, children learn how to think, understand, communicate, behave, show emotions and develop social skills. Playing with your child strengthens your relationship and encourages your child to explore, observe, experiment and solve problems.","<h2>Why loving, nurturing relationships are important</h2>

<p>Children’s relationships shape the way they see the world and affect all areas of their development. Through relationships children learn about their world.</p>

<p>That is because <strong>relationships let children express themselves</strong> – a cry, a laugh, a question – and get something back – a cuddle, a smile, an answer. What children ‘get back’ gives them very important information about what the world is like and how to act in the world – how to think, understand, communicate, behave, show emotions and develop social skills.</p>

<p>For example, it is natural for your baby to want to communicate with you through babbling, facial expressions and gestures like waving, nodding and shaking her head. It is good when you respond with the same kind of ‘talking’ and gesturing, because this shows warmth and love. By responding in a warm, loving and gentle way, you are <strong>helping your baby learn</strong> about communication, behaviour and emotions.</p>

<p>You are also making your child feel safe and secure, and building a strong relationship between you and him. And when your child feels safe and attached to you, he is likely to have the <strong>confidence to explore</strong> his world. That is because he knows you are there to support, encourage and share new experiences with him.</p>

<p>Your child’s most important early relationships are with you, other family members and carers.</p>

<p>Exploring the world gives your child new experiences. Your child needs the stimulation of these experiences to learn how to think, communicate, react and socialise. The more experiences she has with you there to support her, the more she grows and thrives.</p>

<h2>Your relationships with others</h2>

<p>It is not just the relationship between you and your child that shapes his development. It is also your relationships with others. Your child sees how you behave and communicate with other people in your life – for example, your partner, family members, friends and carers.</p>

<p>This shows your child how to be and behave with others and how other people will behave in return. If your child sees and copies kind and respectful relationships, she will learn to act this way in her relationships with others.</p>

<h2>Why play is important</h2>

<p>In the early years, your child’s main way of learning and developing is through play.</p>

<p>Play is fun for your child and gives him an opportunity to explore, observe, experiment, solve problems and learn from his mistakes. He needs your support and encouragement to do this. But it is important to try to find a balance between helping him and letting him make mistakes, because finding out for himself about the world is a big part of learning.</p>

<p>Lots of time spent playing, talking, listening and interacting with you helps your child learn the skills she needs for life, like communicating, thinking, solving problems, moving and being with other people and children.</p>

<p>But more than this, <strong>play is a great relationship builder</strong>. Spending time playing with your child sends a simple message – ""you are important to me."" This message helps your child learn about who he is and where he fits in the world.</p>

<h2>Play and relationships in action: the peekaboo example</h2>

<p>A simple game of peekaboo is a great example of how relationships, play and time together help with all areas of a baby’s development.</p>

<p>When you play peekaboo with your baby, you hide your face behind your hands and pop out again. Your baby probably reaches out her arms, giggles and smiles. It is your baby’s way of saying, ‘Keep playing – this is fun!’ You keep going, and your baby is happy. But after a while, your baby might look away. That is her way of saying she’s had enough play for now. You know it is time to take a break.</p>

<p>This peekaboo example shows that your baby wants to play with you, which means he’s attached to you. And attachment is a sign of <strong>healthy social and emotional development</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, when your baby squeals and reaches out her arms to say she wants more play, she’s developing her <strong>language and motor skills</strong>. When you respond, it encourages her to keep communicating with you.</p>

<p>Peekaboo helps with your baby’s <strong>thinking </strong>too, as he learns about what comes next when you disappear and then reappear.</p>

<p>And when you respond to your baby’s cues for more play or for a break, your baby understands that she can trust you. This helps her feel safe, loved and secure. And feeling safe gives her <strong>confidence to explore </strong>the world.</p>

<p>It is just a simple game of peekaboo, but it is laying the foundation for the baby’s language, thinking, motor skills, and social and emotional development. And it is only possible because of the positive, nurturing relationship between you and your baby.</p>

<h2>Relationships: benefits for life</h2>

<p>Warm and loving interactions between you and your child develop your child’s confidence, resilience and communication. This prepares your child for things he will come across later in life, like working through problems, dealing with stress and forming healthy relationships with other people in adolescence and adulthood.</p>

<p>Strong attachments and relationships early in life also mean your child is more likely to have better mental health and fewer behaviour problems.</p>

<p>By building a warm, positive and responsive relationship with your child, <strong>you are helping shape the adult she will become </strong>and giving her a strong foundation for the rest of her life.</p>",5546,6,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57",59,60,"81, 266, 516, 996, 76, 206",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/development/understanding-development/relationships-development"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/development/understanding-development/relationships-development</a></p>",en,published
721,3-4 years: preschooler development,"There is so much going on in preschooler development at 3-4 years.
At this age, there might be big emotional developments, early friendships, longer sentences, a stronger memory, new physical skills and more.
Reading, creative play, inside and outside play, turn-taking games, and cooking with your child are good for development.
Speak with your doctor or nurse if you are concerned about your child’s development or you need support.","<h2>Child development at 3-4 years: what is happening</h2>

<p><strong>Feelings</strong><br />
This is an important time in your preschooler’s emotional development.</p>

<p>During this year your child really starts to understand that her body, mind and emotions are her own. She knows the difference between feeling happy, sad, afraid or angry.</p>

<p>Your child also shows fear of imaginary things, cares about how others act and shows affection for familiar people. And as he gets more confident, he will also get better at handling his emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Playing and learning</strong><br />
Play is important because it is how your child learns and explores feelings.</p>

<p>Your child is now more interested in playing and making friends with other children. She might start to play more cooperatively in small groups. She understands the concept of ‘mine’ and ‘his/hers’, so sharing starts to get easier.</p>

<p>Your child is becoming more <strong>imaginative during play</strong>. For example, he might play pretend games with imaginary friends or toys, like having a tea party with his toys. He will try different roles – for example, he might pretend to be a doctor or a parent. And at this age, it is common for preschoolers to have imaginary friends , although your child can probably tell the difference between real and fantasy.</p>

<p>By four, your child might enjoy tricking others and describing what happened – for example, ‘Mum thought I was asleep!’ At the same time, she will also worry about being tricked by others.</p>

<p>Your preschooler might be very <strong>curious about bodies</strong> – his own and other people’s. For example, you might find your child looking at his own and other children’s genitals. A combination of natural curiosity and role-playing is usually a typical part of childhood sexual behaviour. But if you are concerned about a child’s sexual behaviour, it is a good idea to talk with your doctor, a paediatrician or another qualified health professional.</p>

<p><strong>Talking</strong><br />
Your child’s language will develop a lot this year.</p>

<p>Your child will <strong>learn lots of new words</strong> by listening to you and other adults and also by listening to stories. She will show more interest in communicating and might like to tell stories and have conversations.</p>

<p>Your child will understand most of what you say and might guess the words he does not know. Generally, he will understand many more words than he can say.</p>

<p>Around <strong>three years</strong>, your child will use sentences of 3-5 words, or even more. Other people will understand what she is saying most of the time. She will point to parts of pictures – for example, the nose of a cow – and name common objects.</p>

<p>By <strong>four years</strong>, your child will speak in longer sentences of around 5-6 words or more. Other people will understand him all the time. He understands most things you say and will follow instructions with 2-3 steps, as long as they are about familiar things – for example, ‘Close the book, and give it to Mum’. He will understand adjectives like ‘long’ or ‘thin’, and use ‘feeling’ words like ‘happy’ or ‘sad’.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong><br />
Your preschooler is <strong>fascinated by the world around her</strong> and will ask lots of ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘why’ questions. When it comes to understanding, your child knows about opposites like big/small and more/less and concepts like ‘on’, ‘in’ and ‘under’.</p>

<p>Your child’s memory is developing. For example, he can remember nursery rhymes and might even repeat them back to you. He will also start to point out letters and numbers that he remembers and name them, and can count up to four objects and sort them by colour and shape.</p>

<p><strong>Everyday skills</strong><br />
Your preschooler loves eating family meals together. She understands your family routine and appreciates special events, like birthdays.</p>

<p>Your child is also becoming more <strong>independent</strong>. For example, he can feed himself, put on shoes that do not have laces, undo buttons and do a bit more for himself when he is getting dressed.</p>

<p>Your child is probably toilet trained, and she might be able to do some daily hygiene tasks on her own, like going to the toilet, wiping her bottom after defecating and washing her hands and face. But she will still need your help and supervision with tasks like brushing teeth.</p>

<p><strong>Moving</strong><br />
Your preschooler loves moving and being active. He is better at walking up steps, riding a tricycle, throwing, catching and kicking a ball, running, climbing, jumping, hopping and balancing on one foot.</p>

<p>When it comes to using her hands, your preschooler might be able to draw a circle or square, build big towers using blocks, and use child-safe scissors. She will love using crayons, pencils and paintbrushes, which is great because drawing and painting build your child’s imagination.</p>

<p>At this age, your child might also:</p>

<ul>
	<li>unscrew a lid from a jar</li>
	<li>know his own gender and age</li>
	<li>know the names of some shapes and colours</li>
	<li>hold a pencil and copy some letters by four years</li>
	<li>dress and undress himself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helping child development at 3-4 years</h2>

<p>Here are some simple things you can do to help your child’s development at this age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child lots of playtime: play helps preschoolers express feelings like joy, excitement, anger or fear. Your child might like messy play in sand or mud, pretend play with puppets, or outdoor play with plenty of running, tumbling and rolling.</li>
	<li>Make time for creative and artistic play: this might be painting, drawing or dress-up games. Musical play is another idea – your child might like to dance, jump around or make music with simple instruments.</li>
	<li>Read with your preschooler: reading together, telling stories, singing songs and reciting nursery rhymes all encourage your child’s talking, thinking and imagination.</li>
	<li>Do some cooking with your child: this helps your preschooler to get interested in healthy food, learn new words and understand maths concepts like ‘half’, ‘1 teaspoon’ or ‘30 minutes’. You can give her simple things to do, like tossing a salad or putting together sandwiches.</li>
	<li>Play games with your child that involve learning to share and taking turns. When you play, say things like, ‘Now it’s my turn to build the tower, then it’s your turn’, or ‘You share the red blocks with me, and I’ll share the green blocks with you’. Sharing is still hard for children at this age, so give your child lots of praise when he shares.</li>
</ul>

<p>At 3-4 years, your child can go to preschool. At preschool your child can learn through play, make friends, and develop responsibility, independence and confidence. Preschool can support and encourage your child’s amazing development – and it can be a lot of fun too.</p>

<h2>Parenting a preschooler at 3-4 years</h2>

<p>As a parent, you’re always learning. It is okay to feel confident about what you know. And it is also okay to admit you do not know and ask questions or get help.</p>

<p>When you are focused on looking after a child, you might forget or run out of time to look after yourself. But looking after yourself physically, mentally and emotionally will help your child grow and thrive.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might feel frustrated, upset or overwhelmed. <strong>It is okay to take some time out</strong> until you feel calmer. Put your child in a safe place, or ask someone else to look after her for a while. Try going to another room to breathe deeply, or call a family member or friend to talk things through.</p>

<p><strong>Never shake a young child.</strong> It can cause bleeding inside the brain and likely permanent brain damage.</p>

<p>It is okay to ask for help. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the demands of caring for your preschooler, talk to your doctor or a trusted friend.</p>

<h2>When to be concerned about child development at 3 years</h2>

<p>See nurse or doctor if you have any concerns or notice that your three-year-old has any of the following issues.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing, hearing and communication</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>does not look you in the eye</li>
	<li>has trouble seeing or hearing things</li>
	<li>is not using three-word sentences.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behaviour and play</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>does not understand simple instructions – for example, ‘Please give me the ball’</li>
	<li>is difficult to separate from his primary caregiver</li>
	<li>is not interested in other children</li>
	<li>does not pretend during play – for example, does not pretend to go shopping or ride on a bus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Movement and motor skills</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is clumsy – for example, trips over a lot when walking or running</li>
	<li>finds it hard to handle small objects – for example, a pencil or crayon</li>
	<li>isn’t drawing simple shapes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to be concerned about child development at 4 years</h2>

<p>See nurse or doctor if you have any concerns or notice that your four-year-old has any of the following issues.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing, hearing and communicating</strong><br />
Your child has trouble seeing or hearing things.</p>

<p><strong>Behaviour and play</strong><br />
Your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cannot understand two-part commands like ‘Put the doll down, and pick up the ball’</li>
	<li>has very challenging behaviour – for example, big tantrums over very small things or still clings or cries when you leave</li>
	<li>does not pretend during play – for example, does not pretend to be mum or dad</li>
	<li>is clumsy – for example, trips over a lot when walking or running</li>
	<li>finds it hard to handle small objects – for example, a pencil or crayon</li>
	<li>has trouble drawing shapes – for example, a circle or square</li>
	<li>has difficulty dressing herself or using the toilet.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should see a child health professional if at any age your child experiences a noticeable and consistent loss of skills he once had.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different speeds. If you’re worried about whether your child’s development is ‘normal’, it might help to know that ‘normal’ varies a lot. But if you still feel that something isn’t quite right, see your nurse or doctor.</p>",796,6,52,59,60,"81, 546, 266, 2566, 5186",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/development-tracker/3-4-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/development-tracker/3-4-years</a></p>",en,published

Reading, creative play, inside and outside play, turn-taking games, and cooking with your child are good for development.
Speak with your doctor GP or nurse if you are concerned about your child’s development or you need support.","<h2>Preschooler development at 4-5 years: what is happening</h2>

<p><strong>Feelings and behaviour</strong><br />
At this age, your child is exploring and learning to express his emotions. He will do this in many ways – for example, by talking, using gestures, noises and in play.</p>

<p>Your preschooler also likes to be around people. She might want to please and be like her preschool-age friends. Imaginary friends could be important to her too. As part of getting along with others, you might hear her saying sorry, agreeing to rules and being pleased when good things happen to other people.</p>

<p>When it comes to cooperating, your child is likely to be more helpful, but sometimes he might still be demanding. By the time he is five years old, he will probably have more control over his behaviour and fewer temper tantrums.</p>

<p>Your child might feel anxious about starting school. Talking to her about this and even visiting the school together can help her feel less worried.</p>

<p>In this year, your child might hide the truth about things sometimes, or even start telling lies. For example, he might say ‘I didn’t do it’ even when he did. This is a normal part of your preschooler’s development.</p>

<p><strong>Playing and learning </strong><br />
Play is important because it is still how your child learns and explores feelings.</p>

<p>When it comes to play, your child likes to sing, dance and act. She also loves make-believe play and is learning the difference between fantasy and reality. She is more aware of her gender and might want to play gender-based games – for example, girls might want to play at being ‘Mum’. Your child might also try different roles and behaviour, like being a doctor or getting married.</p>

<p>Your preschooler might be very <strong>curious about bodies</strong> – his own and other people’s. For example, you might find your child looking at his own and other children’s genitals. A combination of natural curiosity and role-playing is usually a normal part of childhood sexual behaviour. But if you are concerned about a child’s sexual behaviour, it is a good idea to talk with a family doctor, a paediatrician or another qualified health professional.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong><br />
Your preschooler will understand more about opposites – for example, high/low – know the names of letters and numbers out of order, and count to 10. He might remember his address and know the difference between left and right.</p>

<p><strong>Talking</strong><br />
Your child’s language develops a lot this year, and you will notice that she loves <strong>telling stories and having conversations</strong>. She might also tell you how she feels, talk about her ideas, ask lots of questions and say words that rhyme.</p>

<p>At <strong>four years</strong>, your preschooler knows hundreds of words and can use 5-6 words or more in sentences. You will be able to understand what your child is saying all the time.</p>

<p>By <strong>five years</strong>, your child will speak more clearly and will know, understand and use even more words, often in more complex sentences of up to nine words.</p>

<p><strong>Daily life </strong><br />
Dressing himself is pretty easy for your child now. He can also use a fork, spoon and sometimes a knife – for example, to spread butter on bread. You still need to supervise him and help him sometimes, but he can go to the toilet, bathe and brush his teeth by himself.</p>

<p><strong>Moving</strong><br />
Your preschooler loves moving and being active. She is better at walking down steps (maybe using the rail) with alternating feet, throwing, catching and kicking a ball, running, climbing, jumping, hopping and balancing on one foot.</p>

<p>Your child might also develop some new gross motor skills – for example, skipping, jumping backwards or jumping while running.</p>

<p>Your preschooler’s fine motor skills are improving too. He can cut with child-safe scissors and write his first name and some letters. He might also be able to draw a circle and make detailed drawings of people with body parts and clothes.</p>

731,Language development: 3-4 years,"Now your child is a preschooler, you can expect longer, more complex conversations about all sorts of things. Language development in children aged 3-4 years also includes a growing vocabulary and a greater understanding of the basic rules of grammar. You can certainly look forward to some entertaining stories!","<h2>Vocabulary and language development in children at 3-4 years</h2>

<p>Your child learns lots of new words by listening to you and other adults and guessing from context. He also learns from new experiences and from listening to stories read out loud. He will still understand many more words than he says.</p>

<p>Your child will learn and use:</p>

<ul>
	<li>more connecting words like ‘because’, ‘and’ or ‘if’</li>
	<li>more numbers</li>
	<li>names for groups of things like ‘vegetables’ or ‘animals’</li>
	<li>family terms like ‘aunty’ or ‘brother’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child might be able to name basic emotions like ‘happy’, ‘sad’ and ‘angry’.</p>

<p>By four years, your child might know one or more colours and some contrasting concepts like ‘longer’ and ‘bigger’.</p>

<h2>Sentences and grammar in language development</h2>

<p>Your child might begin to <strong>use more complex sentences</strong> that include words like ‘because’, ‘so’, ‘if’ and ‘when’ – for example, ‘I don’t like that because it’s yucky’.</p>

<p>Your child will show that she <strong>understands the basic rules</strong> of language. And she will often apply these rules strictly across all examples, not realising how often a language breaks its own rules. For example, ‘He runned away’ instead of ‘He ran away’ or ‘There were lots of sheeps’ instead of ‘There were lots of sheep’.</p>

<p>By this age, your child might be using ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘me’ correctly. But he might confuse the use of negatives. For example, if you say, ‘Don’t you want to go to the park?’, he might respond by saying, ‘I don’t not want to go’.</p>

<h2>Making conversation</h2>

<p>At this age, your child might <strong>tell stories that follow a theme</strong> and often have a beginning and end. She will often need a lot of prompting to keep the story moving. For example, if you want to hear the end of the story, you might have to ask, ‘And what did the cat do then?’</p>

<p>Your child might reason, predict things and start to express empathy. He will also use lots of ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘where’, ‘who’ and ‘how’ questions to find out more about his world – so try to be patient!</p>

<p>As your child gets closer to four, she might start conversations using questions like ‘Guess what?’ She will talk about all sorts of different topics and her <strong>questions might be more abstract and complex</strong>. For example, ‘If it keeps raining, will we have to build a boat to get to Grandma’s house?’</p>

<p>By age four, <strong>most adults will understand your child</strong>, although your child might not pronounce some words the right way. He might still have trouble pronouncing words that include the sounds ‘l’, ‘th’ or ‘r’.</p>

<h2>Understanding and language development</h2>

<p>When your child does not understand what you say, she might ask you to explain or ask you what specific words mean.</p>

<p>Your child will <strong>understand instructions that have more than two steps</strong>, as long as they are about familiar things – for example, ‘Turn off the TV, put on your pyjamas and get into bed’ or ‘When I open the gate, take my hand, then we’ll walk down to the corner’.</p>

<p>Also, your child will understand questions most of the time, especially if they are about something that is happening right now, or that he can see. He will <strong>understand slightly complicated explanations</strong>, as long as he can see the results himself. For example, he will understand an explanation like ‘When the sun shines on things, it makes them hot. Feel how warm the water in the dog’s bowl is from being in the sun’.</p>

<p>By four, your child might be able to understand and use words to express emotions like ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘mad’ or ‘surprised’.</p>

<h2>Play, communication and language development</h2>

<p>By now, your child will be able to do some simple negotiation with other children. For example, she will be able to talk about who can play with a toy first.</p>

<p>At around four years, your child might even be able to explain why he wants an object from another child – for example, ‘Can I have the green pencil? I want to colour in the grass’.</p>

<p>And at this age, your child will begin to <strong>use language in role play</strong>. For example, she can pretend to be ‘mummy’ and copy her mother’s tone and words.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates. The information in this article is offered as a guide only. If your child’s language development seems unusually slow and you are at all concerned, speak with your doctor, paediatrican or nurse. You could also speak with a speech pathologist. If your health professional does not have concerns about your child, but you still do, it is okay to get another opinion.</p>",1076,6,52,59,60,"196, 201, 206, 266",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/language-development/language-3-4-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/language-development/language-3-4-years</a></p>",en,published
736,Language development: 4-5 years,Your preschooler has so much to tell you and so many words to use! Language development in children aged between four and five years includes a continually growing vocabulary. Your child will also show that he understands the basic rules of grammar. And you will be able to understand almost all of what your child says to you.,"<h2>Vocabulary and language development in children at 4-5 years</h2>

<p>At this age, your child will begin to learn and use more:</p>

<ul>
	<li>connecting words, like ‘when’ and ‘but’</li>
	<li>words that explain complicated emotions, like ‘confused’, ‘upset’ and ‘delighted’</li>
	<li>words that explain things going on in her brain, like ‘don’t know’ and ‘remember’</li>
	<li>words that explain where things are, like ‘between’, ‘above’, ‘below’ and ‘top’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child is also learning more and more adjectives that help him explain things better – for example, ‘empty’ and ‘funny’.</p>

<p>In general, preschoolers <strong>understand many more words than they can use</strong>.</p>

<h2>Sentences and grammar in language development</h2>

<p>As part of her language development at this age, your child will speak in <strong>increasingly complex sentences</strong> by joining small sentences together using words like ‘and’ or ‘because’.</p>

<p>By five years, your child will begin to use many different sentence types. For example, he will be able to say both ‘The dog was chasing the cat’ and ‘The cat was chased by the dog’ to mean the same thing. And your child will be able to use long sentences of up to nine words.</p>

<p>Also by five years, your child will know all of the different word endings. For example, your child can add ‘er’ to the ends of words, so that words like ‘big’ turn into ‘bigger’. She might still make some mistakes though – for example, ‘They wants to go’ instead of ‘They want to go’.</p>

<p>Your child will develop the ability to talk about things that have happened in the past or will happen in the future, rather than just things that are happening right now. He will get better at using the past tense, as well as irregular plurals like ‘mice’ and pronouns like ‘him’, ‘his’ and ‘her’.</p>

<h2>Understanding and language development</h2>

<p>By five, your child will understand and use words that explain when things happen, like ‘before’, ‘after’ and ‘next week’. She might still have trouble understanding complicated ideas like ‘at the same time’. She might start asking questions if she does not understand an instruction.</p>

<p>Your child will start to understand figures of speech like ‘You’re pulling my leg’ and ‘He’s a couch potato’.</p>

<p>And your child will <strong>follow directions with more than two steps</strong>, even if the situation is a new one. For example, ‘Give your ticket to the man over there, and he will tear it, and then we can go to the movie’. But your child might do what he hears first and ignore words that tell him the order he should do things in. For example, he might ignore the word ‘before’ in the sentence ‘Before we go into the movies, give your ticket to the man’.</p>

<h2>Pronunciation in language development</h2>

<p>By the time your child is 4½ years old, strangers can <strong>understand almost every word your child says</strong>.</p>

<p>Your child might still have trouble using some speech sounds – for example, saying ‘fing’ for ‘thing,’ ‘den’ for ‘then’ or ‘wing’ for ‘ring’. She might also occasionally mispronounce some complex words by missing sounds – for example, saying ‘amblance’ instead of ‘ambulance’ or ‘paghetti’ instead of ‘spaghetti’.</p>

<h2>Developing conversation and storytelling</h2>

<p>Your child will keep getting better at storytelling, although he might sometimes give too much or not enough information. He might also have trouble telling things in order and making it clear who he is talking about. His story endings might not make sense or might seem sudden.</p>

<p>But your child will also be better at seeing things from other people’s points of view, so she might add useful background information in conversation. For example, ‘I went to friend's house and we had cake and my friend is from my preschool’.</p>

<p>Your child will be <strong>getting better at taking turns in conversations</strong> with a group of people. And he will start talking at the right volume for the situation. He might make requests more politely, using words like ‘can’, ‘would’ and ‘could’. His requests might also be less direct and obvious. For example, he might say, ‘That smells good!’ when he wants something to eat.</p>

<p>And your child will begin to use language to tease and tell jokes. She might laugh at silly or made-up words.</p>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates. The information in this article is offered as a guide only. If your child’s language development is a long way behind other children her age or you are concerned, for any other reason, speak with your doctor, paediatrician or nurse. You can also speak with a speech pathologist.

741,Stuttering,"Stuttering is a speech problem that makes it hard for children to speak smoothly.
Stuttering often starts when children are 2-4 years old.
Stuttering that continues into primary school can become a problem, so it is important to seek help.
If you notice that your child has a stutter, contact a speech pathologist.","<h2>About stuttering in children</h2>

<p>Stuttering is a <strong>speech problem</strong> that makes it hard for children to speak smoothly.</p>

<p>Children who stutter most often do it at the start of sentences, but stutters can also happen throughout sentences.</p>

<p>Children might also do nonverbal things when they stutter. For example, they might blink their eyes, grimace, make faces or clench their fists.</p>

<p>There are three main types of stuttering. Children who stutter might have one or more of these types.</p>

<p><strong>Repetitions</strong><br />
This is when a sound, part of a word, whole word, or phrase is repeated over and over. For example:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>‘A a a and I want that one.’</li>
	<li>‘An an and I want that one.’</li>
	<li>‘And and and I want that one.’</li>
	<li>‘And I, and I, and I want that one.’</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prolongations</strong><br />
This is when a sound is stretched out – for example, ‘Aaaaaaaaaaand I want that one’.</p>

<p><strong>Blocks</strong><br />
This is when a child tries to speak and no sound comes out.</p>

<h2>Causes of stuttering in children</h2>

<p>We do not really know why stuttering happens.</p>

<p>It might be because there is an <strong>error or delay in the message that a child’s brain sends to the muscles of her mouth</strong> when she needs to speak. This error or delay makes it hard for the child to coordinate her mouth muscles when she is talking, which results in stuttering.</p>

<p>Stuttering <strong>runs in families</strong>. This suggests that stuttering might involve genes that are passed on to children from one or both parents. It means a child is more likely to stutter if other people in his family stutter or have stuttered. But it does not mean that a child who has a family history of stuttering will definitely stutter.</p>

<p><strong>Stuttering is not caused by anxiety or stress.</strong> But stuttering can cause stress, particularly for teenagers.</p>

<p>A child cannot catch stuttering from somebody else. And a child who stutters cannot control it.</p>

<h2>When stuttering in children starts</h2>

<p>Stuttering in children often starts during the preschool years, often at <strong>2-4 years</strong>. This is when children are starting to combine words and make longer sentences.</p>

<p>Some children do not start stuttering until later in childhood.</p>

<p>Stuttering can start suddenly – for example, a child might wake up one day with a stutter. It can also build up over time.</p>

<h2>Stuttering: how much and how often children do it</h2>

<p>How much and how often children stutter varies a lot. Some children stutter only occasionally throughout the day. Other children stutter on almost every word they say.</p>

<p>Stuttering can also change a lot from day to day, week to week, or month to month. Sometimes a child stops stuttering completely for days, weeks or months, and then starts stuttering again.</p>

<p>Parents say that particular situations can make their children’s stuttering better or worse. For example, if a child is excited, tired or angry, she might stutter more.</p>

<h2>Effects of stuttering</h2>

<p>If your child stutters, he might feel frustrated or embarrassed because of the way other children react to the way he speaks. Your child might even avoid talking, or change what he wants to say.</p>

<p>But stuttering <strong>does not actually affect preschoolers’ development</strong>. Preschoolers who stutter can have the same social skills as non-stuttering children. They are not more likely to be shy or withdrawn compared with children their age who do not stutter.</p>

<p>But if stuttering continues into primary school, it can become a problem. <strong>Primary school children</strong> who stutter are less likely to be thought of as leaders by their peers. Primary school children and teenagers who stutter might not want to join in with classroom discussions and are also more likely to be bullied compared with children who do not stutter.</p>

<h2>What you can do if your child stutters</h2>

<p>If you notice that your child has a stutter, it is important to <strong>seek professional help</strong>.</p>

<p>Start by contacting a speech pathologist. The speech pathologist will assess your child’s stuttering and work out whether to treat your child’s stutter straight away, or whether to wait and check your child regularly.</p>

<p>Some children will grow out of stuttering on their own, but there is currently no way to know which children will do this. It is always best to consult a speech pathologist rather than to assume your child’s stuttering will go away by itself.</p>",1321,6,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"196, 201, 5166, 981",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/language-development/stuttering"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/language-development/stuttering</a></p>",en,published
746,Childhood sexual behaviour: preschoolers,"Key points

Sexual behaviour is a mostly typical and healthy part of your child’s development.
Preschoolers might touch, look at and talk about bodies.
Your approach to preschooler sexual behaviour depends on your values. But staying calm is very important.","<h2>Preschooler sexual behaviour: what is typical?</h2>

<p>Sexual behaviour in your preschooler might be a bit confronting, especially the first time you see it. It might help to know that <strong>touching, looking at and talking about bodies</strong> is a mostly typical and healthy part of your child’s development.</p>

<p>Open and honest talk about sex and bodies will help you guide your child’s behaviour now. It also lays the groundwork for future talks about sexual development, respectful relationships and sexuality. It is never too early to start talking.</p>

<h2>Typical preschool sexual behaviour: what it looks like</h2>

<p>Your preschooler might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>touch his genitals or masturbate</li>
	<li>kiss and hold hands with other children</li>
	<li>show his genitals to other children of the same age and look at theirs – ‘Show me yours and I’ll show you mine’</li>
	<li>play mummies and daddies, or doctors and nurses</li>
	<li>copy behaviour he has seen – for example, pinching a bottom</li>
	<li>use slang to talk about toileting and sexual activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What typical preschooler sexual behaviour means</h2>

<p>The behaviour described above is typical for preschoolers. Your child might behave in these ways because:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>it feels good</li>
	<li>she is learning about touch and social rules</li>
	<li>she is curious about the differences between boys’ and girls’ bodies</li>
	<li>she is working out how bodies work</li>
	<li>she is trying to understand families and relationships</li>
	<li>she is testing limits to see what words are okay to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some sexual behaviour and sex play is not typical and might even be a sign of something more serious. You can read more about problematic sexual  behaviour.</p>

<h2>How to respond to typical sexual behaviour in preschoolers</h2>

<p>How you react is important, but your response depends on your values. Some parents are okay with this type of behaviour, and others are not.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to <strong>stay calm</strong>, no matter how you plan to respond.</p>

<p>You can use sexual behaviour as an <strong>opportunity to help your preschooler learn</strong>. Talk with your child and answer his questions openly and honestly, but also at a level he can understand. For example, you could talk about public and private body parts, how girls and boys are different or ways of talking about bodies. You could say, ‘I noticed that you’re curious about boys’ bodies and girls’ bodies. Maybe we can find a book about bodies that we can read together’.</p>

<p>When talking with your child, it is a good idea to <strong>use the proper words for body parts</strong> – for example, vagina, vulva, breasts, penis, testicles and so on. This helps your child learn about her body and tell you clearly about any questions or concerns she has.</p>

<p>If <strong>you want your child to stop the sexual behaviour</strong>, calmly distract your child or find another activity. For example, if your child is playing, ‘You show me yours, I’ll show you mine’, you could say, ‘Put your clothes on and come to the kitchen for a snack’.</p>

<p>You could talk to your child later about what behaviour is okay in your home and what behaviour is okay in front of other children, other parents or teachers. For example, you could explain that although you are okay with your child playing without clothes on at home, it is not okay when other people can see him.</p>",1581,6,"57,58",59,60,"991, 1001, 81, 241, 496",,1,0,,en,published
756,Self-regulation in young children,"Key points

Self-regulation is the ability to understand and manage your own behaviour and reactions.
Self-regulation is important for development. For example, it helps children with learning and social skills.
Self-regulation develops most in the toddler and preschooler years. It continues to develop into adulthood.
Help your child develop self-regulation through talking about feelings and role-modelling.","<h2>What is self-regulation?</h2>

<p>Self-regulation is the ability to understand and manage your behaviour and your reactions to feelings and things happening around you.</p>

<p>It includes being able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>regulate reactions to emotions like frustration or excitement</li>
	<li>calm down after something exciting or upsetting</li>
	<li>focus on a task</li>
	<li>refocus attention on a new task</li>
	<li>control impulses</li>
	<li>learn behaviour that helps you get along with other people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why self-regulation is important</h2>

<p>As your child grows, self-regulation will help her:</p>

<ul>
	<li>learn at school – because self-regulation gives your child the ability to sit and listen in the classroom</li>
	<li>behave in socially acceptable ways – because self-regulation gives your child the ability to control impulses</li>
	<li>make friends – because self-regulation gives your child the ability to take turns in games, share toys and express emotions in appropriate ways</li>
	<li>become more independent – because self-regulation gives your child the ability to make good decisions about her behaviour and learn how to behave in new situations with less guidance from you</li>
	<li>manage stress – because self-regulation helps your child learn that she can cope with strong feelings and gives her the ability to calm herself down after getting angry.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How and when self-regulation develops</h2>

<p>Children develop self-regulation through warm and responsive relationships. They also develop it by watching the adults around them.</p>

<p>Self-regulation starts when children are babies. It develops most in the toddler and preschool years, but it also keeps developing right into adulthood.</p>

<p>For example,<strong> babies</strong> might suck their fingers for comfort or look away from their caregivers if they need a break from attention or are getting tired.</p>

<p><strong>Toddlers</strong> can wait short times for food and toys. But toddlers might still snatch toys from other children if it is something they really want. And tantrums happen when toddlers struggle with regulating strong emotions.</p>

<p><strong>Preschoolers</strong> are starting to know how to play with other children and understand what is expected of them. For example, a preschooler might try to speak in a soft voice if you are in a cinema hall.</p>

<p><strong>School-age children</strong> are getting better at controlling their own wants and needs, imagining others people’s perspectives and seeing both sides of a situation. This means, for example, that they might be able to disagree with other children without having an argument.</p>

<p>Children who typically feel things strongly and intensely find it harder to self-regulate. It is not as hard for children who are more easygoing. Even older children and teenagers sometimes struggle with self-regulation.</p>

<h2>Helping your child learn self-regulation</h2>

<p>The best way to help your child learn to self-regulate is to <strong>provide support</strong> when he needs it. Here are some ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Talk about emotions with your child. For example, ‘Did you throw your toy because you were frustrated that it was not working? What else could you have done?’</li>
	<li>When your child struggles with a strong feeling, encourage her to name the feeling and what caused it. Wait until the emotion has passed if that is easier.</li>
	<li>Help your child find appropriate ways to react to strong emotions. For example, teach your child to take a break or get adult help when he feels overwhelmed. Say things like ‘Let’s relax’ and ‘I can help you if you like’.</li>
	<li>Remember to be patient. It can be very hard for young children to cope when they have strong feelings.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some <strong>behaviour strategies</strong> you can use to help your child with self-regulation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plan for challenging situations where it might be hard for your child to behave well. For example, ‘The shop we are going to has lots of things that can break. It is okay to look, but please don’t touch’. Give your child a gentle reminder as you enter the shop. For example, ‘Remember – just looking, okay?’</li>
	<li>Praise your child when she shows self-regulation and manages a tricky situation. For example, ‘You were great at waiting for your turn’, or ‘I liked the way that you shared with your friend when he asked’.</li>
	<li>Try to model self-regulation for your child. For example, show your child how you can do a frustrating task without getting upset. You could say something like, ‘Wow that was hard. I’m glad I didn’t get angry because I might not have been able to do it’.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to match your expectations of behaviour to your child’s age and stage of development. This can help your child avoid the frustration that comes with not having the skills or understanding to do what he is asked.</p>

<h2>Problems with self-regulation</h2>

<p>From time to time, different things can affect your child’s ability to self-regulate. For example, tiredness, illness and changes to your child’s routine can all affect her ability to regulate her reactions and behaviour. Also, some children have great self-regulation at kindergarten but find it hard at home. Other children struggle in busy, noisy places like shopping centres.</p>

<p>Although these problems with self-regulation are pretty normal, it is a good idea to <strong>speak with a professional if you are worried</strong> about your child’s behaviour or you’re having trouble managing his behaviour as he gets older. For example, you could talk to your doctor, your nurse, or your child’s  educator or teacher.</p>

<p>Consider seeking professional help if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>seems to have more tantrums or difficult behaviour than other children of the same age</li>
	<li>is behaving in difficult or out-of-control ways more often as she gets older</li>
	<li>is behaving in ways that are dangerous for herself or others</li>
	<li>is difficult to discipline and your strategies for managing her behaviour do not seem to be working</li>
	<li>is very withdrawn and has a lot of trouble interacting with others</li>
	<li>doesn’t seem to have as many communication and social skills as other children of the same age.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child has challenging behaviour and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or a disability, talk with the professionals who work with him. They will be able to suggest ways to manage his behaviour and to help him learn self-regulation skills.</p>",5391,6,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"496, 1006, 81, 231, 256",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/self-regulation"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/self-regulation</a></p>",en,published
761,About self-esteem: children 1-8 years,"Self-esteem is feeling good about yourself. Good self-esteem helps children try new things, take healthy risks and solve problems. It gives them a solid foundation for their learning and development.","<h2>Self-esteem: the basics</h2>

<p>Self-esteem is about liking yourself and who you are. This does not mean being overconfident – just believing in yourself and knowing what you do well.</p>

<p>For children, self-esteem comes from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>knowing that they are loved and that they belong to a family and a community that values them</li>
	<li>spending quality time with their families</li>
	<li>being encouraged to try new things, finding things they are good at and being praised for things that are important to them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important thing you can do to foster your child’s self-esteem is to tell your child that you love him. Say it often and for no reason other than to show you appreciate your child.</p>

<h2>Relationships, connections, belonging and your child’s self-esteem</h2>

<p>Being connected to other people who care about her is good for your child’s self-esteem. It gives her a stronger sense of her place in your immediate and extended family. And being connected to friends and people in the community helps your child learn how to relate to others and can boost her confidence.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for nurturing your child’s self-esteem through relationships:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Strengthen your child’s sense of his family, culture and community. For example, show your child family photos and share family stories, take part in community or cultural events like religious festivals, and encourage your child to join a local sporting club or interest group, or join as a family.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to value being part of your family. One way to do this is by involving your child in chores. When everyone contributes to the smooth running of the household, you all feel important and valued.</li>
	<li>Make your child’s friends welcome and get to know them. Encourage your child to have friends over to your house, and make time for your child to go to their houses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality time and your child’s self-esteem</h2>

<p>When you spend quality time with your child you let your child know she is important to you. Doing things together as a family can help strengthen a sense of belonging and togetherness in your family, which is also good for your child’s self-esteem.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop family rituals. These could include a story at bedtime, a special goodbye kiss or other ways of doing things that are special to your family.</li>
	<li>Let your child help you with something, so that he feels useful. For example, your preschooler could help you set the table for dinner.</li>
	<li>Plan some regular one-on-one time with your child, doing something that she enjoys, whether it is drawing, doing puzzles, kicking a soccer ball or baking cakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Achievements, challenges and your child’s self-esteem</h2>

<p>Success and achievements can help your child feel good about himself. But your child can also build self-esteem doing things he doesn’t always enjoy or succeed at. You can still praise his effort and determination – and remind him that these will help him succeed in other areas, or next time.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to help your child succeed, achieve and cope well with failure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When your child has a problem, encourage her to think calmly, listen to other people’s points of view and come up with possible solutions to try. This builds important life skills.</li>
	<li>Help your child learn new things and achieve goals. When your child is younger, this might mean praising and encouraging him when he learns something new, like riding a bike. When he is older, it might be taking him to sport and helping him practise.</li>
	<li>Celebrate big and small achievements and successes. And remember to praise your child’s effort, not just her results. For example, ‘You tried that puzzle piece in lots of different spots and you finally got it right. Well done!’.</li>
	<li>Keep special reminders of your child’s successes and progress. You can go through them with your child and talk about your special memories, and the things he has achieved.</li>
	<li>Teach your child that failing is a part of learning. For example, if she keeps missing the ball when she is learning to catch, say ‘You’re getting closer each time. I can see how hard you are trying to catch it’.</li>
	<li>Teach your child to treat himself kindly when he does fail. You could be a role model here. For example, ‘I tried a new recipe, and the cake looks a bit funny. But that’s okay. It smells delicious’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things that can damage children's self-esteem</h2>

<p><strong>Messages that say something negative about children</strong> are bad for their self-esteem – for example, ‘You are slow, naughty, a bully …’. When children do something you do not like, it is better to tell them what they could do instead. For example, ‘You haven’t done your homework. You need to sit down now and finish your maths questions’.</p>

<p><strong>Messages that imply that life would be better without children</strong> might harm their self-esteem. For example, ‘If it were not for the children, we could afford a new car’.</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring children, treating them like a nuisance and not taking an interest in them</strong> are likely to be bad for children’s self-esteem. An example might be, ‘I am sick and tired of you’. Frowning or sighing all the time when children want to talk to you might have the same effect.</p>

<p><strong>Negative comparisons with other children</strong>, especially brothers and sisters, are also unlikely to be helpful. Each child in your family is different, with individual strengths and weaknesses. It is better if you can recognise each child’s successes and achievements.</p>

<p>All parents feel frustrated and tired sometimes. But if parents send the message that they feel like this about their children all the time, children get the message that they are a nuisance.</p>

771,Good family relationships: how to build them,"Good family relationships help your children feel secure and loved. They help you feel good too. You can build good relationships in your family with quality time, communication, teamwork and appreciation.","<h2>Why family relationships are important</h2>

<p>Good family relationships are <strong>enjoyable for their own sake</strong> – it just feels good to be part of a warm and loving family.</p>

<p>But good family relationships are <strong>important for lots of other reasons</strong> too. They:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make children feel secure and loved, which helps their brains develop</li>
	<li>can help to overcome difficulties with children’s eating, sleeping, learning and behaviour</li>
	<li>make it easier for your family to solve problems and resolve conflict</li>
	<li>help you and your children respect differences of opinion as your children develop more independence</li>
	<li>give children the skills they need to build healthy relationships of their own.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is why it is always worth looking at the relationships you share with your children and other family members, and thinking about how you can improve them.</p>

<p>As a parent, you are doing the best you can for your children, probably while you are juggling work, friends, household management and more. But even for the busiest of parents, there are plenty of easy things you can do to develop good family relationships.</p>

<p>Good family relationships are an important part of strong families. Strong families grow from love, security, communication, connection – and a few rules and routines too.</p>

<h2>Quality time and family relationships</h2>

<p>Quality family time can happen anywhere. It is about making the most of the time you spend together. Here are some <strong>ways you can make quality time happen</strong> in your family:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use everyday time together to talk and share a laugh. For example, family meals and car travel can be great times to catch up on the day.</li>
	<li>Have one-on-one chats with each family member to strengthen individual relationships. It can just be five minutes before each child goes to bed.</li>
	<li>Set aside time with your partner, if you have one. It can be a good idea to explain to your children that it is good for your relationship with your partner to have this quality time together.</li>
	<li>Do regular, fun things together as a family. This can be as simple as a family soccer game at the local park on the weekend, or a family board games night each week.</li>
	<li>Make decisions together about what to do for special events like birthdays. Even young children can be part of these decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Positive communication and family relationships</h2>

<p>Positive communication is about making the time to listen to each other, listening without judgment, and being open to expressing your own thoughts and feelings. When you have positive communication in your family, it helps everybody feel understood, respected and valued, and this strengthens your relationships.</p>

<p>Try these <strong>positive communication ideas</strong> to strengthen your family relationships:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When your child or partner wants to talk, stop what you are doing and listen with full attention. Give people time to express their points of view or feelings.</li>
	<li>Be open to talking about difficult things – like admitting to mistakes – and all kinds of feelings, including anger, joy, frustration, fear and anxiety. Just remember that talking about feeling angry is different from getting angry, though.</li>
	<li>Be ready for spontaneous conversations. For example, younger children often like to talk through their feelings when they are in the bath or as they are getting into bed.</li>
	<li>Encourage your children and partner with praise. For example, ‘It’s a big help when you bring the bins in without being asked. Thanks!’.</li>
	<li>Show appreciation, love and encouragement through words and affection. This can be as simple as saying ‘I love you’ to your children each night when they go to bed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Positive non-verbal communication</strong><br />
Not all communication happens in words, so it is important to pay attention to the feelings that your children and partner express non-verbally.  It is also important to be aware of the non-verbal messages you send. For example, hugs, kisses and eye contact send the message that you want to be close to your child. But a grumpy tone of voice or a frown when you are doing something together might send the message that you do not want to be there.</p>

<h2>Teamwork and family relationships</h2>

<p>When your family is working as a team, everyone feels supported and able to contribute. It is easier to work as a team when everyone understands where they stand, so it helps to have clear expectations, limits and boundaries.</p>

<p>You can encourage teamwork in some of these ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Share household chores. Even very young children like the feeling of belonging that comes from making a contribution – sometimes, at least!</li>
	<li>Include children in decisions about things like family activities, rules and holidays. Give everyone – including young children – a chance to have their say. Family meetings can be a good way to do this.</li>
	<li>Let children make some of their own decisions. The decisions you allow will depend on your children’s abilities and maturity, and the boundaries you have set. For example, you might let your 5-year-old child decide what she would like to wear to school but you would not let her decide to walk home by herself.</li>
	<li>Create family rules that state clearly how your family wants to look after and treat its members. For example, ‘In our family we speak respectfully to each other’. Rules like this help everyone get along better, and make family life more peaceful.</li>
	<li>Work together to solve problems. This involves listening and thinking calmly, considering options, respecting other people’s opinions, finding constructive solutions, and working towards compromises.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appreciation for each other and family relationships</h2>

<p>Valuing each other is at the heart of good family relationships. Here are some ways you might be able to do this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take an interest in each other’s lives. For example, make time to go to each other’s sporting events, drama performances, art shows and so on.</li>
	<li>Include everyone in conversation when you are talking about the day’s events. For example, ‘What was the highlight for you today, Selena?’.</li>
	<li>Share family stories and memories. These can help children appreciate things that are not obvious, or that they have forgotten – for example, mother's sporting achievements when she was younger, or the way a big sister helped care for the youngest child after he was born.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge each other’s differences, talents and abilities, and use each other’s strengths. </li>

776,Preventing sibling fights: eight tips,You can do a lot to prevent sibling fights by helping your children learn to get along and guiding them towards better ways of resolving conflict. Lay the groundwork with our eight essential tips.,"<h2>1. Look after each child’s needs</h2>

<p>Your children might need different rules and boundaries depending on their ages and temperaments. But they need to feel that you love and value them all equally – this way, they will not feel they have to compete for your affection and attention. You can <strong>foster these feelings by spending special time with each child</strong> regularly, giving lots of hugs and smiles to everyone, and trying not to compare children with each other.</p>

<p>Although children need to learn about sharing, it is also helpful if they have some special things of their own that they do not have to share. A little bit of private space – even just a drawer that siblings cannot get into – is a good idea too.</p>

<p>Children will also feel valued if you make it clear that it is not OK for younger children to mess up older children’s activities, and vice versa.</p>

<h2>2. Set clear family rules</h2>

<p>Rules let children know what is okay and what is not. If you have family rules in place, it is easier for you to remind children of how you expect them to treat each other.</p>

<p>Here are some<strong> tips for making rules work</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Involve children in setting up rules. This will help your children remember them.</li>
	<li>Put a copy of your house rules on the fridge or somewhere everyone can see them.</li>
	<li>Follow through every time children bend or break the rules. Start with a friendly reminder – ‘Are we all speaking nicely to each other?’ Then give another chance. If children still break the rules, use an agreed consequence.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Set up routines</h2>

<p>It is much easier to handle disagreements about everyday things when you have a family routine. It means that everyone knows who sits where, who does what chores and on what days, and who is first in line for the computer or the bathroom.</p>

<p>A <strong>sample routine</strong> might look like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Television: The younger child chooses the program from 6.30-7 pm. The older child chooses from 7.30-8 pm (after the younger child has gone to bed).</li>
	<li>Games: One sibling chooses on Saturdays, the other chooses on Sundays.</li>
	<li>Bathroom: One sibling uses the bathroom first in the morning, then the other.</li>
	<li>Chores: Both siblings take it in turns to do the chores – tidying the bedroom, watering the plants.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Catch them being good</h2>

<p>This means noticing and giving positive feedback to your children when they are behaving well. When you<strong> tell children clearly and specifically what they are doing well</strong>, you are much more likely to see that behaviour again.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of clear and specific praise and encouragement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘I really like the way you are both taking turns on the bicycle.’</li>
	<li>‘You are all sharing and playing really nicely together.’</li>
	<li>‘Hey, you worked out that problem really well. How about we celebrate with a movie tonight?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Show children how to get along</h2>

<p>You are your children’s number-one role model. Your children will notice if you work out differences without fighting.</p>

<p>If you want your children to work things out calmly and respectfully, they need to see you doing this. If you want them to be able to say sorry to others, they need to see you apologising too.</p>

<h2>6. Coach your children</h2>

<p>You are your children’s problem-solving coach. You teach them how to handle disagreements and guide them towards skills for managing angry feelings, negotiating and playing fair. This is better than being a referee who breaks up fights or steps in when they’re brewing.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>tips for coaching your children in problem-solving</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your children opportunities to play with others. Playgroups, playdates and games help children learn to play well together and practise positive alternatives to fighting.</li>
	<li>Step in with ideas as soon as you see that children are finding it hard to work things out. For example, ‘Remember to share’, or ‘Can you boys think of a way that you can both have a turn?’</li>
	<li>Talk things over later. With older children, working out a blame-free solution afterwards will make the fight less likely to happen again. For example, ‘How could you have handled it so that both of you got to use the computer?’</li>
	<li>Help children find ways to express upset or angry feelings through calm words or positive activities. For example, water play, painting and playdough help younger children express feelings. Older children and teenagers might find that going for a run or playing music helps.</li>
	<li>Teach and model the social skill of ‘respectful disagreeing’. This involves saying something that you can both agree on, then saying what you do not agree on. For example, ‘I agree that Grandma gave you the book for your birthday, but I don’t think it is fair to stop your sister reading it if she asks politely’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Cool down fighting hot spots</h2>

<p>It can help to think ahead about how to handle fights in tricky situations. In some cases it might help to explain that if fighting breaks out, you will remove a treat or privilege (or whatever your family rules say). But it is also a good idea to set things up so that there are fewer opportunities for children to fight.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to help you plan for common fighting hot spots.</p>

<p><strong>At home</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure there are enough toys for everyone, so they can play together without always having to take turns.</li>
	<li>If you are organising playdates, try inviting a friend for each of your children, or organising for one child to go somewhere else if the other is having a friend.</li>
	<li>Distract children or change the environment if you sense a fight coming. For example, suggest a new game, join in yourself for a while, take the children outside to play, or read a book with a child on either side of you.</li>
	<li>If you need to make a phone call, set children up with an activity (or two separate activities) that will keep them interested.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the supermarket</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a special rule. For example, ‘If there are no fights at the supermarket we will go the park when we get home’.</li>
	<li>Ask children to hold onto opposite sides of the shopping trolley. Or send them to opposite ends of the aisle to choose grocery items.</li>
	<li>If supermarket fights are very bad, see whether you can leave one of the children with a friend or family member while you shop.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Out and about</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Distract children if you sense a fight coming. For example, a game like ‘I spy’ can work at the supermarket, the beach, on public transport or in the car.</li>
	<li>On public transport, park yourself or a pram between children.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In the car</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If there is a spare seat in the back, sit children either side of it. Or put a grown-up or older child between the children most likely to fight.</li>
	<li>If your oldest child is old enough, put her in the front seat. Keep in mind that it is illegal in some countries to allow children under four to travel in the front seat, and there are legal requirements for car travel for children under seven.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always pull over if a fight breaks out while you are driving. Turning around to talk to children or separate them takes your attention off the road.</p>

<h2>8. Let children work it out sometimes</h2>

<p>With your help, children can learn to work out disagreements by themselves, without fighting. This can help your children get along better and deal positively with conflicts with other children.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for helping your children work things out:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Let children go</strong> if they are trying to work things out. Talking, debating and even arguing are all signs that children are trying to work things out. Add some enthusiastic feedback about the way they’re interacting. For example, ‘Hey, I'm really proud of the way you’re trying to work this out on your own’.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep an eye on the action.</strong> This is your best chance of preventing full-scale fights.</li>
	<li><strong>Give some tips.</strong> A few well-placed suggestions might be all children need. For example, ‘Can you think of a way you can all use the computer when you need to?’ or ‘Remember to be fair and take turns. Whose turn was it last?’</li>
	<li><strong>Give friendly reminders</strong> about rules of the house, what you expect and what will happen if a fight breaks out. For example, ‘Remember we all speak nicely’, or ‘Are you keeping your hands and feet to yourselves?’</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes disagreements about the computer or a favourite toy seem to turn into name-calling and arguing straight away. If this sounds like your situation, you might want to start the reminders and coaching as soon as the computer is turned on or the toy comes out.</p>",1291,56,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"81, 521, 251, 996, 1021, 506, 516, 266, 3821",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/friends-siblings/preventing-fights"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/friends-siblings/preventing-fights</a></p>",en,published

791,Nightmares,"Nightmares are bad dreams that can wake children up and leave them feeling scared and upset.
Be patient if your child has a nightmare. She might need you to reassure her that everything is OK.
If your child has a lot of nightmares, think about what he’s doing or seeing during the day that might trigger the nightmares, or what is happening in the news that is scary.
Nightmares can be caused by stress and trauma. See a professional if you’re worried.","<h2>What are nightmares in children?</h2>

<p>Nightmares are bad dreams that can cause children to wake up feeling scared and upset.</p>

<p>It’s normal for children to have nightmares about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>realistic dangers like aggressive dogs, sharks or spiders</li>
	<li>imaginary fears like monsters</li>
	<li>distressing events they’ve seen or experienced (changes in their lives because of the pandemic, for example).</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on their language ability, children can sometimes tell you about their bad dreams in detail.</p>

<p>Nightmares tend to happen in the second half of the night, when your child is sleeping lightly and dreaming. Some younger children might find it hard to get back to sleep after a nightmare.</p>

<h2>Tips for dealing with nightmares and bad dreams</h2>

<p>Children often wake tearful and upset after a nightmare. <strong>They need comfort from you.</strong> As children get older, they’ll get better at understanding that a dream is just a dream.</p>

<p>Here are ideas to help you handle your child’s nightmares or bad dreams:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If your child wakes up because of or during a nightmare, explain that it was a bad dream. Reassure him that everything is OK and that he’s safe. A kiss and a cuddle might help your child settle again.</li>
	<li>Let your child know it’s OK to feel scared after a nightmare. Avoid dismissing the fear or saying that your child is being silly, because nightmares can seem very real to children.</li>
	<li>If your preschool-age child has dreamed about monsters, explain that monsters are only make-believe. You could say that make-believe things might be scary, but they can’t really hurt children.</li>
	<li>Be patient if your child talks about a nightmare the next day. Listen to her worries – don’t dismiss or downplay them. Calmly talking together about the bad dream can reduce its emotional power. But if your child seems to have forgotten about a nightmare, it’s probably best not to raise the topic.</li>
	<li>As your child gets older, encourage him to see a bad dream as something he can recover from himself, then go back to sleep on his own. You could use praise – for example, ‘You didn’t need me for long after your bad dream last night. You were able to settle yourself really well’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try these ideas <strong>if your child has a lot of nightmares, or is dreaming about the same thing</strong> over and over again:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gently ask your child about interactions with other children, television shows, computer games or other daytime experiences. Then you can help her avoid experiences that might be triggering the nightmares. For example, if your child has been watching <em>Doctor Who</em> and having nightmares about aliens, it might be a good idea for her not to watch it for a while.</li>
	<li>Talk with your child, at the child's level, about events in the news or in their lives right now.  How is your child understanding these events and what are her worries?</li>
	<li>Help your child change a recurring dream. For example, if the dream often involves a scary alien, suggest that your child has a magic wand in the dream to make the alien disappear. Encourage your child to come up with ideas on how to be a hero in the bad dream. He can go over these ideas in his mind during the day.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child is regularly getting enough sleep.</li>
	<li>If your child is prone to anxiety or stress, think about how you can help your child relax before bedtime.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>It can be a good idea to seek professional advice if your child is having nightmares and is also having a lot of anxiety during the day.</p>

<p>Also seek help if your child has nightmares after going through a traumatic event – for example, a natural disaster like a bushfire, a car accident, a school lockdown and so on.</p>

<h2>What causes nightmares?</h2>

<p>Occasional nightmares are normal. If your child has nightmares every now and then, it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with her emotionally. You don’t need to worry.</p>

<p>Children with <strong>vivid imaginations</strong> might have nightmares more often than other children. Again, you don’t need to worry.</p>

<p>But if your child is having a recurrent nightmare, or he’s having particularly bad dreams, he might be experiencing some kind of <strong>stress</strong> during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Traumatic events</strong> can also cause nightmares. If a child has experienced some type of traumatic event, she might have nightmares about it for several weeks or months afterwards.</p>",1771,56,"52,57,58",59,60,"546, 936, 496, 206, 96",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/sleep/nightmares-night-terrors-sleepwalking/nightmares"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/sleep/nightmares-night-terrors-sleepwalking/nightmares</a></p>",en,published
796,Changing the environment: behaviour management tool,"Key points

Your child’s environment can influence his behaviour.
If you change your child’s environment, you can often change your child’s behaviour.
You can change the physical environment, the timing of activities, and your requests and instructions.","<h2>Changing your child’s environment: what does it mean?</h2>

<p>If your child is behaving in a way you don’t like, it’s a good idea to look at what’s going on in your child’s environment. By changing your child’s environment, <strong>you</strong> <strong>might be able to change your child’s behaviour</strong> too.</p>

<p>Changing the environment can just mean making <strong>small, manageable changes</strong> to what’s happening around your child. It doesn’t mean moving house, changing the furniture, installing expensive play equipment and so on!</p>

<h2>Your child’s ‘environment’: what is it?</h2>

<p>When it comes to children’s behaviour, the environment just means the <strong>little things around your child</strong>. Your child’s ‘behaviour environment’ includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>his location – for example, at the park, at home, at the supermarket</li>
	<li>toys, books and play equipment, but also other things you might not want him to play with</li>
	<li>other children and how they’re behaving</li>
	<li>sensations like noise and light</li>
	<li>the time of day</li>
	<li>your requests and instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These things can influence your child’s behaviour and even trigger unwanted behaviour sometimes. For example, it’s normal for your child to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>want to play with the things around her</li>
	<li>explore her surroundings</li>
	<li>feel tired if it’s nap time</li>
	<li>feel overwhelmed if there’s a lot of noise or activity</li>
	<li>not want to share her favourite toys</li>
	<li>not follow your instructions if she doesn’t understand them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing your child’s physical environment</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas for changing the physical things in your child’s environment to help your child behave the way you want.</p>

<p><strong>At home</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Move fragile or expensive items out of sight and reach – this is important for safety as well as good behaviour.</li>
	<li>Make a ‘quiet space’ for your child to use when he feels overwhelmed. This could just be a special cushion with some of your child’s favourite books nearby.</li>
	<li>Make sure screens like tablets and TVs are off when you need your child to focus on something like getting ready for school in the morning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Out and about</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose a safe outside space if you can – for example, a courtyard, play area or backyard. You’ll be less stressed, and your child’s activities are less likely to upset others.</li>
	<li>On car, train or bus journeys, change where you all sit. For example, have one parent sit between two children. Or let one child sit next to a window for a while, then change.</li>
	<li>For a family day out, look for places that have things that both you and your child will enjoy – for example, a playground for your child and a coffee cart for you.</li>
	<li>Use music to change the environment on a car trip. You can play upbeat music if your child is bored, or soothing music when you want her to settle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toys and belongings</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Install a child gate on the door of an older sibling’s room. This will give the older child some time playing with toys, undisturbed by a younger sibling.</li>
	<li>Put your child’s favourite toys in a place that he can reach. This way he won’t be tempted to climb or get into unsafe places when he’s looking for his toys.</li>
	<li>Help your child choose and put away toys she might not want to share with visiting children.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing the timing of activities in your child’s environment</h2>

<p>You can change your child’s environment by <strong>changing when things happen</strong>. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Encourage quiet, calming activities before bedtime.</li>
	<li>Take your child grocery shopping after an afternoon nap.</li>
	<li>Get up earlier to reduce pressure and stress in the morning rush for school.</li>
	<li>Start bath time earlier to avoid tantrums about getting out of the bath.</li>
	<li>Plan frequent breaks on a long car drive.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing your requests and instructions</h2>

<p>You might be able to change your child’s behaviour by <strong>changing the way you tell or ask your child to do things</strong>.</p>

<p>An instruction is when you tell your child to do something. If you give <strong>clear, short and simple instructions</strong>, your child will know what’s expected of him – for example, ‘Please hold my hand when we cross the road’. But children can feel overwhelmed or rebellious if there are too many instructions.</p>

<p>A request is when you ask your child to do something. For example, ‘Could you set the table, please?’ Your child can choose to say yes or no to a request. Requests <strong>give your child choices and a sense of control</strong>, which might make your child more likely to cooperate.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to aim for a mix of instructions and requests. And try to use requests more often than instructions.</p>",956,56,"49,50",59,60,"546, 496, 206, 156",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/changing-environment"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/changing-environment</a></p>",en,published
801,Distraction: behaviour management tool,"Distraction is a simple way to manage children’s behaviour.
Distraction can help you avoid situations that might result in difficult behaviour.
Don’t use distraction if your child is very upset or has hurt someone.
Help your child learn ways to distract herself, as she gets older","<h2>Using distraction as a behaviour management tool</h2>

<p>Distraction is a simple strategy that’s good for situations when behaviour might be a problem. For example, this might be when children:</p>

<ul>
	<li>are getting cranky</li>
	<li>have been sitting still for a long time</li>
	<li>are having trouble sharing or taking turns with others.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pointing out something interesting, starting a simple game, pulling funny faces – you’ve probably come up with many tricks like these to distract your child.</p>

<p><strong>Distraction usually works.</strong> So it’s a great option for managing your child’s behaviour in many situations.</p>

<h2>Tips for distraction</h2>

<p>Here are distraction tips that usually work for <strong>children of all ages</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give children something else to do. Introduce a new activity, toy or game, or even show children something new they can do with the toy they already have.</li>
	<li>Change the scene. Put children where they can see different things, or move them to a new spot either inside or outside.</li>
	<li>Think ahead. Have a few ideas for fun activities. It could be as simple as planning some outside play when you can see that children are getting bored inside.</li>
	<li>Sing some songs or rhymes together. This can be useful when you can’t stop what you’re doing, like when you’re driving or cooking.</li>
	<li>If you’re out and about, take some fun toys or books that you can pull out when you need them.</li>
	<li>Especially as children get older, help them come up with their own ideas about what might distract them:  ""We can't leave for the park for another hour.  What could you do at home that would be fun, right now?""</li>
</ul>

<p>Distraction can work for <strong>older children</strong> too. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Change the topic of conversation.</li>
	<li>Suggest a simple game or activity. For example, suggest your children try a jigsaw or a game of Uno if they say they have nothing to do.</li>
	<li>Suggest a break when things aren’t going well. For example, you could say, ‘Looks like you’re feeling frustrated with your drawing. What about riding your scooter instead?’</li>
</ul>

<p>If you sense that your child is bored and needs distraction, why not encourage your child to come up with her own ideas? Making the most of boredom can be great for her creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>

<h2>When not to use distraction</h2>

<p>Distraction works best when you can see that your child might be about to do something wrong or get upset.</p>

<p>Distraction won’t help if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has hurt someone</li>
	<li>is having a tantrum</li>
	<li>is very upset.</li>
</ul>

<p>In situations like these, it’s best to deal with the behaviour directly.</p>

<p>For example, if your child has hurt another child, it might be tempting to distract both children with toys or activities. But this doesn’t help your child understand that it isn’t OK to hurt other people. It might be better to use time-out, as long as your child is old enough to understand this consequence.</p>

<p>Also, trying to distract your child when he’s having a tantrum might send the message that his strong feelings aren’t important. It’s better to handle tantrums by acknowledging your child’s feelings.</p>

<p>It’s easy to suggest screen time as a distraction. If you do this, it’s good to be clear about what you’re letting your child do. For example, be specific about what apps she can play with or what TV show she can watch, and for how long.</p>",1816,56,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"546, 996, 496, 206, 156",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/distraction"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/distraction</a></p>",en,published
806,Using attention to improve behaviour,"Key points:

When your child behaves well, give him lots of positive attention. This makes the behaviour more likely in future.
Positive attention for behaviour means catching your child being good and praising them.
Positive attention also helps your child feel secure and loved. It’s good for your relationship with your child.","<h2>Attention and your child’s behaviour</h2>

<p>Your <strong>attention is a big reward</strong> for your child. If your child behaves in a particular way and gets your attention, she’s likely to behave that way again.</p>

<p>When you give <strong>attention for good behaviour</strong>, it shows your child that behaving in a way that you like will get positive interest. This means you can use attention to encourage the behaviour you want.</p>

<p>When you start paying attention to good behaviour, you might realise how often your child already behaves well. You might also find you start to feel more positive because you’re more focused on your child’s good behaviour than on his difficult behaviour. And as your child responds more and more to your positive attention, there might be less difficult behaviour for you to manage.</p>

<p>Positive attention is also about showing delight in your child and warmth in your relationship. It helps your child feel secure and loved, which is important for her overall development.</p>

<h2>Using attention to improve behaviour</h2>

<p>Positive attention for behaviour means <strong>catching your child being good</strong>. It means tuning in to what your child is doing and letting him know that you’ve noticed he’s doing the right thing and that you’re pleased.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways you can give this kind of attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>praise – for example, ‘Good sharing, Kezia’</li>
	<li>encouragement – for example, ‘Keep trying, Lachlan’</li>
	<li>physical affection or gestures – for example, hugs and cuddles, or a ‘thumbs up’ when your child plays quietly while you’re on the phone</li>
	<li>active listening – for example, listening with interest when your child tells you something in a normal voice instead of shouting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of attention works best if you <strong>do it often</strong>, rather than occasionally. That’s because you get into the habit of looking for positives. Also, your child gets plenty of reminders of what kind of behaviour you like and want to see more of.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>give attention for good behaviour anywhere</strong> – at the supermarket, when you’re eating, doing the dishes or walking to school, and on the bus. It doesn’t take any extra time when it’s something you do as part of your everyday interactions with your child.</p>

<p>Praising good behaviour is particularly important for behaviour that your child has found difficult to learn. You can praise the effort as well as the behaviour. For example, your child might have had a lot of trouble remembering not to interrupt when you’re on the phone. You could say something like, ‘Well done, Darcy. I know it’s hard for you to wait while I’m talking, so I really appreciate that you let me finish’.</p>

<p>In general, <strong>praise your child six times for every one time you correct her</strong>.</p>

<p>Your child won’t always behave in ways you like. So the trick is to pay more attention to the behaviour you want, and less to the behaviour you don’t want. You can use planned ignoring and consequences to show your child his behaviour isn’t OK, without giving him too much attention.</p>

<h2>Giving your child attention: how to make it part of everyday life</h2>

<p>The more you give your child positive attention, the more natural it becomes – and the better it is for your relationship with her. A good relationship with you is also better for your child’s behaviour.</p>

<p>Here are some general things you can do that will also help with your relationship and your child’s behaviour:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Take time to tune in to your child. </strong>Notice the things that fascinate him – petals on a flower, ants crisscrossing the pavement, sauce bottles at the supermarket – rather than rushing him on to the next activity. Take notice of the books he’s choosing at the library, or the skills he’s building on the monkey bars at the park. He’ll know he’s valued if you take interest in the things that interest him.</li>
	<li><strong>Follow your child’s lead. </strong>When you’re spending time with your child, it’s good to let your child choose games or activities whenever possible. This sends the message that your child’s interests are important, which helps her feel loved and gives her confidence.</li>
	<li><strong>Get close. </strong>You can sit on the floor, kneel in the grass, or squat beside your child’s chair. Face your child and move to his side rather than watching from across the room. Look into his eyes, uncross your arms, and smile, smile, smile.</li>
	<li><strong>Comment on what your child is doing.</strong> For example, you could say, ‘I see you like the red truck’ or ‘That’s an interesting bug you’re looking at’. This shows your child that you’re paying attention and are interested. You build her trust and confidence and your relationship simply by giving attention.</li>
</ul>",1356,56,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"546, 496, 206, 936",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/attention"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/attention</a></p>",en,published
811,Child behaviour tools: planned ignoring,"Planned ignoring is when you take your attention away from your child for a little while when your child behaves badly. This can be a useful child behaviour tool and needn’t feel like rejection. However, this should not be done if you are feeling angry or frustrated with your child. This should be used within a secure, loving relationship. Also, no technique is a magic way to help children behave well, each child is unique and also developing and changing.","<h2>What is planned ignoring?</h2>

<p>Planned ignoring is one of a number of possible tools for guiding your child's behavior.  But remember, no one tool is the magic answer, and each child is different.  Most important, all these guidance tools are meant to be used within your warm, loving relationship with your child.  Now let's look at this tool!</p>

<p>Planned ignoring is <strong>paying no attention to a child when she’s misbehaving.</strong></p>

<p>For example, if you’re having a family meal and your child is bouncing up and down on his seat, you could leave him out of the conversation and not look at him until he stops. When he stops, you could say, ‘I love it when you sit still on your chair at dinner. Why don’t you tell us what you did at preschool today?’.</p>

<p>The key is to reward your child with lots of attention when she’s behaving well – but don’t give her any attention when she behaves badly.</p>

<h2>Why does planned ignoring work?</h2>

<p>Planned ignoring works because if you have a warm,secure relationship already, your attention is a big reward for your child.</p>

<p>If your child behaves in a particular way and gets your attention, he’s likely to behave that way again. But if you ignore the behaviour, it’s less likely to happen again. So attention for good behaviour usually leads to more good behaviour, and no attention for bad behaviour usually leads to less bad behaviour.</p>

<p>In your child's mind, a parent's reaction to bad behaviour is better than no attention at all, so even criticism or disciplining could feel like a reward to your child – Ind can actually lead to more bad behaviour.</p>

<p>Should you tell your child you’re ignoring him? It depends on whether telling your child might reward him with attention. For minor behaviour, you might not say anything. Or you could explain once that you won’t respond when your child behaves in a particular way. Then ignore the behaviour whenever it happens after that, without saying anything else.</p>

<p>It's important that ignoring should <strong>not </strong>feel like rejection to your child.  If you are really angry, and that anger comes through in your tone of voice (""Grrrr, I'm ignoring you!""), it's best not to use this tool right now.</p>

<h2>Planned ignoring: tips</h2>

<p>Here are some tips for using planned ignoring.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Completely ignore</strong>. Don’t look at your child or say anything while she’s misbehaving. Glances, smiles or even frowns can be rewarding.  Where it’s safe and practical, calmly walk away from your child while she’s behaving badly.</li>
	<li><strong>Start ignoring when the behaviour starts.</strong> Stop ignoring when the behaviour has been stopped for a while. This might mean 20 seconds of ignoring for a toddler and a few minutes of ignoring for older children. You can respond again when your child stops misbehaving.</li>
	<li><strong>Plan some ways of distracting yourself</strong> if you think you’ll find it hard to ignore your child. You could put on some music, count in your head , do breathing exercises, or plan your shopping list.</li>
	<li><strong>Consistently pay attention to the behaviour you want to see </strong>instead of the behaviour you’re ignoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, sometimes children behave in challenging ways to express big feelings or worries. We're all dealing with some scary situations.  When this happens it’s good to try talking with your child about his feelings – or you can talk afterwards when he’s calm. When you help your child to understand his feelings, it helps him to manage his feelings and behaviour.</p>

<h2>Deciding to use planned ignoring</h2>

<p>Ignoring isn’t always the best option. Before deciding to ignore behaviour, it’s a good idea to check a few things.</p>

<p><strong>Is the behaviour rewarded by someone else’s attention?</strong><br />
If the behaviour is rewarded by someone else’s attention – for example, siblings or friends – it won’t make any difference if you ignore it. In this case, you might need to look at another behaviour tool – for example, changing your child’s environment .</p>

<p><strong>Should you ignore the behaviour?</strong><br />
 You can’t ignore dangerous behaviour or behaviour that hurts others or damages property – for example, biting, hitting, pulling on the curtains or throwing things. In this case, a behaviour tool like consequences or time-out might be appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Can you ignore the behaviour wherever it happens?</strong><br />
If you ignore the behaviour in one place but not another, you’ll get more of the behaviour in the place you don’t want it. For example, if you ignore your child yelling at home but not at the supermarket, you might get more yelling at the supermarket. You could try planning ahead for the behaviour at the supermarket.</p>

<p><strong>Will other people ignore the behaviour?</strong><br />
If you have managed to successfully ignore a behaviour, but your partner, friend or relative suddenly comes in and pays attention, your good work will be undone. Backing each other up is an important part of guiding your children’s behaviour, so it’s good if you and your partner can talk  and agree on what behaviour you’ll ignore.</p>

<p>Be prepared – behaviour that’s ignored often gets worse before it gets better. Children might complain or nag more, hoping you’ll respond. You should consider this when deciding whether to use planned ignoring as a behaviour tool.</p>",1231,56,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"546, 996, 1021, 206, 496",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/planned-ignoring"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/planned-ignoring</a></p>",en,published
816,Using routines to manage behaviour,Routines help family life run smoothly and can help with children’s behaviour. You can use routines to help children with regular activities and to plan for demanding times of the day. Talking about routines or involving children in creating them can help children understand and follow routines.,"<h2>Why routines help with behaviour management</h2>

<p>Routines help family members know <strong>who should do what, when, in what order and how often</strong>. For example, your children know that they take turns with loading and unloading the dishwasher each day. This can mean less conflict and fewer arguments about these kinds of boring activities.</p>

<p>A routine can also help you plan for <strong>times and activities when your child often misbehaves</strong>, like when you’re shopping, driving or visiting. For example, a simple routine for driving might be listening to music or playing ‘I spy’ together, before your child looks at books by herself.</p>

<p>You can also build routines for young children around <strong>play, meals and sleep</strong>. When children have had enough good-quality sleep, nutritious food and plenty of play, they’re more likely to behave the way you want.</p>

<p>And <strong>routines help young children feel safe and secure</strong>. They need to feel safe and secure to develop confidence and learn, including learning about appropriate ways to behave.</p>

<h2>Creating routines</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to get you started with family routines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plan routines for demanding times in the family day – for example, before and after work and school. Things often run more smoothly when you have a routine that gives everybody something to do or that keeps children busy while you get things done.</li>
	<li>Add some downtime into your child’s routine. This gives your child time for a sleep or rest, which can help with behaviour. It also gives him time to learn to entertain himself.</li>
	<li>If you want to put time limits on some activities, like screen use, make this part of the routine. For example, children can watch TV or use their tablets, but only between 5 and 5.30 pm (or whatever suits your family).</li>
	<li>Link two or more activities together. This can help your child get through boring activities faster. It also works because doing one activity helps you remember to do the other one. For example, your child could clean teeth while having a bath.</li>
	<li>Talk about routines with your child. Even toddlers can understand simple, consistent explanations – for example, ‘First clean teeth. Then story time with Dad’. And for school-age children, discussions about routines can help them learn important things like how to be ready on time.</li>
	<li>Use language or ideas your child can understand to talk about your routine. For example, if your child is too young to understand time, try saying, ‘We only watch <em>Play School</em>’, instead of ‘We only watch half an hour of TV’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting children to follow routines</h2>

<p>So you’ve got a routine, but how do you get your child to follow it – without nagging? Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Put up an illustrated poster of your routine where everyone can see it. Making the poster with your child could be fun and give you the chance to talk about the routine.</li>
	<li>Involve your child in parts of the routine that she can manage by herself – for example, washing her hands before eating.</li>
	<li>Find ways to remind your child to follow the routine without your help. For example, put a radio alarm clock in your child’s room. The music can be a signal that it’s time to wake up, time to start getting ready for school, or time to come out of the bedroom in the morning.</li>
	<li>Think about whether parts of the routine can be your child’s responsibility. Your child can learn new skills and help the family by doing household chores. For example, a preschooler could set the table.</li>
	<li>Watch out for and praise your child when he follows the routine without help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Routines don’t mean you and your family are rigid or inflexible. Changes and last-minute diversions are a normal part of life.</p>",761,56,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"496, 206, 546, 996",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/routines"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/routines</a></p>",en,published
821,Transitions for children: helping children change activities,"Key points 
It can be hard for children to move from one activity to another, especially if they are enjoying something and do not want to stop.
Routines can help with transitions that happen every day. Children can accept change better when they know it is coming.
It also helps to give children enough warning, allow time for transitions, offer choices and resist bad behaviour.","<h2>What are transitions?</h2>

<p>Transitions happen when your child has to stop doing one activity and start doing something else. Examples of transitions include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>getting ready to leave the house</li>
	<li>putting away toys before bedtime</li>
	<li>turning off the television or computer</li>
	<li>getting out of the bathroom.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child probably needs to make transitions many times a day. But transitions can be hard, especially if your child is happy with what she is doing and does not want to stop.</p>

<h2>Planning transitions: tips</h2>

<p>A predictable family routine is likely to help with transitions that happen every day. Children can accept change better when they know it is coming.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for planning transitions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Explain what is happening to your child before you start the day or leave the house. Knowing what to expect will help children – especially older children – have realistic expectations.</li>
	<li>Use a family calendar that shows what different family members are doing each day. You could use a calendar with pictures for younger children.</li>
	<li>Consider whether you need to teach your child new skills or knowledge to help him with daily transitions. For example, you might need to teach your child to tie his shoelaces to make leaving the house easier. Or perhaps your child needs a written or visual list to help him pack his schoolbag each morning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timing transitions: tips</h2>

<p>Transitions are a part of every child’s day. Timing them right can make it easier for your child to change from one thing to another:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose your timing. If you can, stop one thing and start another during a natural break in your child’s activity. For example, wait until your child has finished her puzzle before you tell her lunch is ready. If you are sensitive to what your child is doing, it can make transitions easier for you both.</li>
	<li>Give your child some warning about any change of activity coming up. For example, ‘You have five more minutes to play. Then it will be time to go home’, or ‘Once more on the slide and then we are going home’.</li>
	<li>If your child finds transitions particularly challenging, consider allowing more time between activities. This gives your child extra time to make the change and adjust.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Giving choices about transitions</h2>

<p>You cannot always give your child a choice about stopping one activity and starting another. But sometimes you can give her a choice about other things. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child a choice about things that are part of the transition. For example, ‘We have to go to the car in a minute. You can take one toy with you. Which one will it be?’ or ‘Do you want to do that yourself or shall we do it together?’</li>
	<li>Limit options. For example, let your child choose between two different t-shirts, but not every item in his wardrobe! If he will not choose, you can choose for him.</li>
	<li>Avoid giving your child a choice about a transition if there is not really a choice. For example, when you say, ‘Would you like to pack up those toys now?’ you suggest a choice. Instead you could say, ‘Start packing up those toys now please’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making transitions more positive</h2>

<p>Pointing out the positive side of the transition can direct your child’s attention away from the change and onto something that he likes or is happy about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>See whether you can make transitions fun. For example, ‘Can you march like a soldier to the car?’ or ‘How about we play “I spy” on the trip home?’</li>
	<li>Link something your child does not want to do with something that she likes – for example, ‘First we clean up the toys, then we have a snack’.</li>
	<li>Point out any good things your child can look forward to after the transition. For example, ‘If we leave now, we will have time to play with your trains before dinner’.</li>
	<li>Praise your child for handling transitions well. Emphasise how good it is when you both work together as a team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting transitions</h2>

<p>It is okay if your child is disappointed about having to stop. That is natural. You can use his disappointment as an opportunity to talk about emotions, and encourage him to use words to express feelings – for example, ‘I know you feel frustrated that you did not have time to play another game’.</p>

<p>But if your child plays up or has a tantrum, be careful not to accidentally reward that behaviour by giving her more time on the activity. You can be understanding, but also clear and firm. Gently insist that your child does what you ask.</p>",1346,56,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"546, 496, 206, 996, 1021, 1031",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/transitions"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/behaviour-management-tips-tools/transitions</a></p>",en,published
826,Shyness: babies and children,"Some children are naturally shy or ""slow to warm up."" This means they’re uncomfortable in many social situations, especially new situations.
You can help a shy child by recognising that shyness is normal, but also supporting him in social situations and gradually encouraging brave social behaviour.
Seek help if shyness is causing a problem for you or your child.","<h2>About shyness and shy children</h2>

<p><strong>Shy behaviour, or being ""slow to warm up,"" is normal</strong> in babies and children.</p>

<p>For example, a baby might cling to her parents, cry in social situations, or physically try to avoid social interaction by hiding her head, moving or turning away, or shutting her eyes.</p>

<p>A preschooler might not want to talk when unfamiliar people speak to him. He might hide behind a parent, or avoid joining in games.</p>

<p>A school-age child might avoid answering questions in class, have trouble making friends, prefer to sit back and watch others play, or avoid new activities.</p>

<p><strong>There’s nothing wrong with shyness.</strong></p>

<p>All children are different, and some children are just more shy than others.</p>

<p>Also, in some cultures shyness is considered desirable behaviour in children, showing modesty and respect.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Supporting your child with shyness</h2>

<p>Shyness doesn’t always go away over time, but <strong>children can learn to be more confident and comfortable</strong> interacting with other people. These tips can help.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for babies and young children</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your baby time to feel comfortable. Don’t make him go straight into the arms of an unfamiliar adult. Instead, encourage the adult to play with a toy near your child and use a calm voice.</li>
	<li>Stay with your child in social situations, like playgroups or parents groups, while encouraging her to explore. As your child gets more comfortable you can gradually move away for short periods. For example, sit on a chair with other adults while your child plays on the floor. You can move back to your child if you need to.</li>
	<li>Let your child know that his feelings are OK and that you’ll help him manage them. For example, ‘I can see you feel a bit scared because you don’t know who’s at the party. Let’s look together before we walk in’.</li>
	<li>Avoid over-comforting your child. Over-comforting sends the message that you think this is a scary situation. And the extra attention might accidentally encourage your child’s shy behaviour.</li>
	<li>Praise ‘brave’ behaviour like responding to others, using eye contact, trying something new or playing away from you. Be specific about what your child has done – for example, ‘Quinn, I liked the way you said hello to the boy in the park. Did you notice how he smiled when you did that?’</li>
	<li>Try to model confident social behaviour so your child can watch and learn from you. For example, when someone says hello to you, always say hello back.</li>
	<li>If other people say your child is ‘shy’, gently correct them in front of your child. For example, ‘Lou takes a little while to warm up. Once she’s comfortable she’ll be happy to play’. This sends the message that you understand how your child feels, and she can deal with the situation when she’s ready.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When shyness might be a problem</h2>

<p>Your child’s shy behaviour might be a problem if it’s causing him (or you) a lot of distress and/or getting in the way of enjoying daily life.  If so, it could help to talk to a professional.</p>

831,Children’s repetitive habits,"Key points

Many children have repetitive physical habits like nail-biting, thumb-sucking or nose-picking.  Although they can be annoying, they may help relieve stress, and they usually go away by themselves.
To help your child break a habit, use gentle reminders when your child does the habit. Praise your child when he doesn’t.","<h2>What are repetitive physical habits?</h2>

<p>A habit is a behaviour that your child does over and over again, almost without thinking.</p>

<p>Often children’s habits might bother or frustrate you, but <strong>usually they’re nothing to worry about</strong>.</p>

<p>Children’s habits usually involve touching or fiddling with parts of their faces or bodies. Sometimes children are aware of their habits, and sometimes they aren’t.</p>

<p>Some <strong>common habits</strong> in children are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>sucking a finger or thumb. </li>
	<li>biting or picking at nails</li>
	<li>twirling and pulling hair</li>
	<li>picking their nose or sores</li>
	<li>picking at their lips or the insides of their cheeks</li>
	<li>chewing objects like pencils and clothing</li>
	<li>grinding teeth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do these habits start?</h2>

<p><strong>Habits can be comforting</strong> for children.  For example, as toddlers leave behind the baby stage, habits like thumb-sucking can be a way of soothing anxiety.  And sometimes habits start because<strong> children are bored</strong>.</p>

<p>Note: some toddlers seem to get comfort from some common but slightly unusual behaviour such as body-rocking or head-rolling. Most children stop by the time they’re five years old.</p>

<p>Some behaviour might look like a habit but have a medical cause. For example, if a child suddenly starts pulling or hitting an ear and is also cranky, it might be because she has an ear infection or is teething.</p>

<h2>Gently breaking habits</h2>

<p><strong>Most habits go away by themselves.</strong> But if your child’s habit is getting in the way of everyday activities, has become embarrassing, or is even causing some harm, you might want to take action.</p>

<p>For example, sucking thumbs or fingers is normal. But your child might be sucking fingers all the time. If this is getting in the way of talking or eating, or your child is being teased by peers because of it, it could be time to gently break the habit.</p>

<p><strong>Some tips for breaking habits</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Praise will go a long way towards stopping habits. For example, you can say, ‘That’s great. I can hear your words clearly when your fingers aren’t in your mouth.’</li>
	<li>Remind your child about the habit. For example, if your child sucks on a sleeve, you can say, ‘Please don’t chew on your sleeve – it’s a bit yucky’.   But don't make this a battle.</li>
	<li>Try to encourage your child to do something else during idle times. For example, you could encourage your child to play with a toy that has moveable parts while watching television.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to get help for habits</h2>

<p>At about three years of age, <strong>thumb-sucking and finger-sucking</strong> can become a problem for children’s teeth development. If your child is still finger-sucking beyond three years, talk to a heath professional about how to discourage this habit.</p>

<p>Also, if you think a new stress or anxiety in your family's life may be causing your child to develop a repetitive physical habit, you might perhaps talk with a health care professional about these reasons.</p>

<h2>Repetitive physical habits in children with additional needs</h2>

<p>Children with additional needs (for example, a child on the autism spectrum)  might have more, or more intense, habits than typically developing children. A psychologist or other specialist can help if you’re looking for more information.</p>

<h2>Habit or tic?</h2>

<p>Tics aren’t habits. Tics are muscle spasms that cause jerky movements that seem out of the child’s control. Examples include repeated blinking, face twitches, and arm or shoulder jerks. Sometimes tics are caused by conditions like Tourette syndrome.</p>

<p>A child might be able to stop a tic for a short time, but it will come back when the child stops thinking about it. If you feel a tic is distressing for your child, it’s best to seek help from a health care professional.</p>",1596,56,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"936, 546, 496, 206, 101",,1,0,,en,published
836,Relationships with toddlers: ideas and tips,"Key points

Warm and responsive relationships with parents are key to toddlers’ development and wellbeing.
Relationships with toddlers change as they develop independence, language and big feelings.
Strengthen relationships by listening and talking with toddlers, doing everyday things together, and giving positive attention.","<h2>About relationships with toddlers</h2>

<p>Warm, stable and responsive relationships are fundamental to children’s development and wellbeing.</p>

<p>When you have this kind of relationship with your toddler, she feels safe and secure. A sense of security gives your toddler confidence to explore the world and learn. And as your child explores the world, she learns how to think, understand, communicate, behave, show emotions and develop social skills.</p>

<h2>Your relationship with your toddler: what to expect</h2>

<p>Children develop quickly in the toddler years. As your toddler develops, you’ll probably find your relationship with him changes.</p>

<p>Your toddler is learning that she’s a separate person. She’ll <strong>want to be independent</strong> – for example, she might want to feed herself or get her own clothes on. She might also be less willing to be talked out of things once she’s made up her mind. At the same time, your toddler might fear being separated from you and not want you to leave her with other people.</p>

<p>Your toddler’s ability to use and understand <strong>language </strong>will develop very quickly. This language development means you can share more activities and games, and start working on social skills like sharing and turn-talking. For example, you can play with a ball and say ‘Roll the ball’ or ‘My turn now’.</p>

<p>Your toddler’s <strong>emotions</strong> are developing too. He’ll have big feelings, but won’t always be able to control them or find the words to express them. He might express frustration through having a tantrum. If you can tune into your child’s feelings, you might find that you can sometimes stop tantrums from happening. And tuning in is always a good way to build your relationship.</p>

<p>Toddlers are learning that <strong>they can do things that make other things happen</strong>, like chasing a seagull to make it fly away. You might find the time you spend with your toddler is a lot more active than it used to be. But if you’re around while your child explores, she’ll feel safe and have the confidence to try new things.</p>

<p>A strong parent-child relationship is about more than just having fun together. By tuning in to your child’s feelings, praising him for positive behaviour, and helping him find words for big emotions, you can help him behave well.</p>

<h2>Building a strong relationship with your toddler: tips</h2>

<p>Children of all ages need parents and caregivers who are warm and responsive, who pay them attention, and who make them feel safe. Here are some ideas to help you keep building this kind of relationship with your toddler:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your toddler plenty of positive attention. This can be as simple as getting down to your toddler’s level and gently putting your arm around her shoulders when she shows you something in the sandpit.</li>
	<li>Make time to share fun activities and play together. For example, toddlers love dressing up, playing with big empty cardboard boxes and running around in the garden or park. It’s best just to follow your child’s lead with play.</li>
	<li>Read together. Regular reading with your toddler creates a special time for bonding. It also stimulates your toddler’s imagination and helps him learn about the world around him.</li>
	<li>Share regular family meals. Family meals can strengthen your family relationships and your child’s sense of belonging.</li>
	<li>Support your toddler’s developing independence by letting her make decisions. For example, you could ask her to choose between two healthy snacks or between two t-shirts when she’s getting dressed.</li>
	<li>If your toddler gets frustrated or upset, help him find words for his feelings and comfort him too – for example, ‘Aw. Banana fell down. It’s OK. There’s more banana in your bowl’. Understanding emotions is a key part of self-regulation, which is important for all your child’s relationships, now and in the future.</li>
	<li>If your toddler is having trouble separating from you, talk to her about times when you’ll be apart – for example, ‘I’m going to buy food for the fridge. Nanna is here with you, and I’ll be back for your nap time’. Children feel more secure if they know when you’re going to be away, where they’ll be, and when you’ll be back.</li>
	<li>Think about your child’s temperament when you plan to spend fun time together. For example, if you have a less sociable toddler, you might find it works better to stay home and finger paint instead of going to a busy play centre.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to look after yourself. Even spending a few minutes a day doing something you enjoy like going for a walk or reading a magazine can make a big difference to how you feel about the time you spend with your child. Looking after yourself is good for you, so it’s good for your relationship with your child and her development.</p>",786,56,"50,51",59,60,"546, 496, 996, 1021, 936",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/connecting-communicating/connecting/connecting-with-your-toddler"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/connecting-communicating/connecting/connecting-with-your-toddler</a></p>",en,published
841,Toddler talking and communication: what to expect and how to help,"Key points

Language develops rapidly in the toddler years.
Notice what your child shows interest in, comment on it, and let your child respond.
Give your child words to describe feelings or body language.
Get toddlers talking through everyday activities and play.","<h2>Toddler talking: what to expect</h2>

<p>In the toddler years, your child’s language starts to explode, as your child moves from using single words to putting together simple sentences. Your child is also starting to understand and follow simple requests, like ‘Bring me your book’ or ‘Wave bye-bye’.</p>

<p>But toddlers often don’t have the words to express big emotions or talk about complex experiences. With your help, your child will start learning how to use words to communicate better.</p>

<h2>Helping toddlers learn to talk and communicate</h2>

<p>You don’t need to ‘teach’ your toddler to talk. He’ll learn through <strong>everyday interactions</strong>, especially with you.</p>

<p>When you’re with your child, it’s all about <strong>tuning in and noticing what your child is interested in</strong>. Then you can make a comment or ask a question, and give your child time to respond. For example, if your toddler points to a beetle in the garden, you could say, ‘Look at the little green beetle. I wonder what it’s doing’. Then wait and see how your child responds.</p>

<p>When you share moments like these with your child, it’s important to <strong>give your child time to find words</strong> for her ideas. This is about waiting to hear what your child says, rather than trying to put words into her mouth.</p>

<p>And when your child responds, it’s important to <strong>show you’re really listening</strong>. You can do this by making lots of eye contact and saying things like ‘You think the beetle is going for a walk? Yes, there it goes!’ When you do this, you send the message that what your child is saying is important to you.</p>

<p>Simple and meaningful interactions like these encourage your child to talk more and use more words. They also help your child learn about the pattern of conversations.</p>

<h2>Helping toddlers turn body language and feelings into words</h2>

<p>In the toddler years, children often use <strong>body language</strong> when they don’t have the words to express ideas and feelings. For example, your child might tug on your pants to be picked up, shake or nod his head, or reach for something he wants.</p>

<p>This is a great time to <strong>encourage your child to use words</strong>. You can do this by repeating back what you think your child wants. For example, ‘You look hungry. Do you want more apple?’</p>

<p>You can help your child understand how <strong>words, feelings and body language go together</strong> by talking about them and making connections. For example, ‘Thanks for showing me the paint is knocked over. I can see you’re really sad your picture got messed up’. This links the feeling with the word ‘sad’.</p>

<p>Understanding feelings and being able to talk about them are important steps towards self-regulation.</p>

<h2>Tips to get toddlers talking</h2>

<p>Here are some practical, everyday ideas to get your toddler talking and help her learn more words:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read together and share stories. Stories that have word patterns, rhymes and colourful pictures often capture toddler interest and attention.</li>
	<li>Sing songs or say rhymes with your child. This helps him to understand different word sounds – and it’s fun. If you need help remembering the words of songs and rhymes, check out our Baby Karaoke.</li>
	<li>When you play with your toddler, use words to describe what’s happening – for example, ‘Push the ball back to Mummy’ and ‘You got the ball!’</li>
	<li>Give your child choices using words and objects. For example, you could hold up two pairs of shoes and say, ‘We’re going outside. Would you rather wear your red boots or your blue shoes?’</li>
	<li>When your child uses ‘made-up’ verbs like ‘goed’, repeat the sentence back with the correct word. For example, ‘Yes, the man went out the door’.</li>
	<li>When your toddler uses simple word combinations like ‘Dog go away’ or ‘Daddy come here’, repeat the words back to your child in full sentences. For example, ‘You want Daddy to make the dog go away?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips to help toddlers understand words</h2>

<p>It’s easy to forget that children don’t understand everything we say. Here are some ideas to try when your toddler seems puzzled by something you’ve said:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try saying it in different ways. For example, ‘Put the blocks in the box’, or ‘Here’s the box. Put the blocks in it’, or ‘Take the blocks to the box, and put them in’.</li>
	<li>Try to use the same words to describe things. If you repeat the same words, your child will start to understand them. For example, you might always use the word ‘pyjamas’ when you talk about what your toddler wears to bed.</li>
	<li>When you need to give instructions or requests, make them clear and limit them to one or two steps – for example, ‘Lids on the markers. Then put the markers in the tub’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Speak with a child health professional if your toddler isn’t using gestures like head nods or pointing, or if she isn’t using words to communicate.</p>",666,56,"50,51",59,60,"936, 546, 496, 196, 201, 171",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/connecting-communicating/communicating/toddlers-talking"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/connecting-communicating/communicating/toddlers-talking</a></p>",en,published
846,Using time-out to guide your child’s behaviour,"When you give your child time-out for unacceptable behaviour, you take your child away from interesting activities and attention.  When used as one part of your guidance, time-out can be a very effective way of helping children learn the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.","<h2>What is time-out?</h2>

<p>Time-out involves taking your child away from interesting activities and not giving your child attention for a short period of time.</p>

<p>If your child is behaving in an unacceptable way, time-out is a strategy that can help you guide your child’s behaviour.</p>

<p>Time-out works best when it’s used within a warm, secure parent-child relationship and in combination with other guidance strategies – for example, in combination with prevention of challenging behaviour (Using distraction; having enough for your child to do) and praise for acceptable behaviour.</p>

<h2>How time-out works</h2>

<p>When used thoughtfully, time-out may be a <strong>powerful way to teach children about unacceptable behaviour</strong>.  However, it can be misused. This article aims to help you put time-out in its place.</p>

<p>Even young children can understand that when they misbehave, they may lose the chance to be around other people and interesting things for a short time. Time-out also gives your child the chance to think about what happened and what she might do differently next time.</p>

<p>And time-out is less likely to make children feel anger, shame or fear than other approaches to discipline like smacking.</p>

<p>Time-out works well when the time you usually spend with your child is warm and loving  and when your behaviour expectations are reasonable for your child's age.  If your child’s behaviour or other things in your life are affecting the time you spend with your child, talk with your health provider or another professional.</p>

<h2>About quiet time and time-out</h2>

<p>There are two types of time-out strategy – quiet time and time-out.</p>

<p><strong>Quiet time</strong><br />
This is when you remove your child from the situation, but not the place. For example, if you’re at the park you might ask your child to sit under a tree for five minutes and calm down. If you’re at home you might ask your child to sit in a chair against the wall in the same room as you.</p>

<p>If your child won’t stay in quiet time in the same room, you can try time-out in another room.</p>

<p><strong>Time-out</strong><br />
In time-out, your child <strong>goes to a previously arranged time-out area</strong>, like a spare room or hallway, after misbehaving. The time-out area is usually a safe and boring room or location without toys or games.</p>

<p>You can leave the door of the area open, but if your child comes out before you say so, you can close the door until time-out is over. This can help to stop any battles between you and your child.</p>

<p>Closing the door might be the best choice if time-out leads to very loud or aggressive behaviour – from your child or you. Keeping the door open might be the best choice if you need to supervise your child during time-out.</p>

<p>Remember, time out isn't always the answer.  Sometimes challenging behaviour occurs because your child isn’t feeling well, a crisis in your family has occurred, or for some other reason, including your child’s stage of development.  Keep this in mind as you decide on behaviour guidance strategies for your child.</p>

<h2>Introducing a time-out strategy in your family</h2>

<p>Here are some things to think about before you start using a time-out strategy.</p>

<p><strong>What are your strategies for staying calm?</strong><br />
First of all, when you’re using time-out, it’s important to stay calm. If you find yourself getting stressed, try taking a few deep breaths to help relax your body and mind.</p>

<p><strong>How old is your child?</strong><br />
Time-out can be a useful strategy for children aged 3-8 years. Children younger than three years aren’t usually ready for time-out.  It's better to just use other approaches, described in other articles.</p>

<p>As your child gets older, you can start to involve him in working out limits and rules.</p>

<p><strong>Is now a good time to start?</strong><br />
Sometimes children start behaving in challenging ways when there have been changes in their lives – for example, the arrival of a baby brother or sister, moving house, or starting child care, preschool or school.  The global pandemic is causing stress in families and affecting children as well as adults.</p>

<p>In situations like these, you might wait until your child has had some time to adjust to the changes, and think about other ways to encourage positive behavior. </p>

<p><strong>Which behaviour would you like to work on?</strong><br />
Think about your child’s behaviour and what you would like to change – for example, hitting or swearing. Keep in mind that it’s best to work on changing one behaviour at a time. When the behaviour you’ve chosen is no longer a problem, you could work on another behaviour – for example, throwing toys.</p>

<p><strong>How long will your child’s time-outs or quiet times be?</strong><br />
They don’t have to be long to be effective. A good rule of thumb is <strong>one minute per year of age</strong>, up to a maximum of five minutes – for example, three minutes maximum for a three-year-old and five minutes maximum for children aged 5-8 years. You could set a timer to help you keep track of the time.</p>

<p><strong>Will you give a warning before putting your child in time-out?</strong><br />
It depends on the situation and your child.  You might want to give your child a chance to change his behaviour before you use time-out. Or you might decide that some behaviour, like hitting or biting, should result in an instant time-out.</p>

<p>If you decide on a warning before time-out, be sure to follow through if your child’s behaviour doesn’t change. Otherwise time-out won’t work.</p>

<p><strong>How will you explain time-out?</strong><br />
If you haven't used this strategy before, you need to explain what behaviour will lead to a time-out and what will happen. The best time to have this talk is when you’re both feeling calm. Young children will also need reminders and more help understanding the connection between their behavior and time out.</p>

<p>For younger children, you might practise what will happen using a teddy bear or doll, or even another adult.</p>",4666,56,"52,57,58",59,60,"546, 251",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/rules-consequences/time-out"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/rules-consequences/time-out</a></p>",en,published
851,Preschool bullying: helping your child,"If your child is being bullied at preschool, it’s important to step in quickly. You and the preschool staff need to work together to stop the bullying.","<h2>Bullying at preschool</h2>

<p>Bullying can be devastating for children’s confidence and self-esteem, especially in the preschool years.</p>

<p>If your child is being bullied at preschool, he needs lots of love and support, both at home and at preschool. He also needs to know that you’ll take action to prevent any further bullying.</p>

<h2>Talking with your child about the bullying</h2>

<p>If your child is being bullied, one of the best ways to help her is to <strong>listen and talk about the bullying</strong>. It’s also a good way to find out more before you talk to the teacher about it.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s how to get started</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Listen: give your child your full attention and consider talking in a quiet space. Ask your child simple questions, then listen to the answers. Try saying things like, ‘So what happened next?’ and ‘What did you do then?’</li>
	<li>Stay calm: this is a chance to show your child how to solve problems. If you feel angry or anxious, wait until you feel calm before you discuss the situation with your child or with others.</li>
	<li>Summarise the problem: you could say something like, ‘So you were sitting on your own eating your lunch. Then Sam came up and took your lunch box and threw it across the playground’.</li>
	<li>Let your child know it’s normal to feel upset: help your child to understand that his feelings are normal. For example, ‘No wonder you’re feeling so sad about this’.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child knows it’s not her fault: for example, ‘It didn’t happen because you’re smaller than the other kids. Paddy might have been upset about something at home. But that’s no excuse’.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>next step is showing your child that you care</strong> and will help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Agree that there’s a problem: for example, ‘It’s not OK for someone to treat you like that’.</li>
	<li>Praise your child: telling you about the bullying might not have been easy for your child. Praise will encourage him to keep sharing problems with you. For example, ‘I’m really pleased that you’ve told me about this’.</li>
	<li>Make it clear that you’ll help: for example, ‘It sounds like things haven’t been so good. Let’s think about some things we could do to make it better’.</li>
	<li>Avoid negative comments: it won’t help to say things like, ‘You need to stand up for yourself’ or ‘You poor thing. Never mind, you can stay home’.</li>
</ul>

<p>And<strong> if your child understands why some children bully</strong>, it might help her realise the situation isn’t her fault. For example, you could tell your child that the person doing the bullying might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>be copying other people, and not know that bullying is wrong</li>
	<li>not know how to be nice to other people</li>
	<li>have a problem and think that making other people feel bad will make things better.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Talking to your child’s preschool about the bullying</h2>

<p>If your child is being bullied, you need to <strong>get help from preschool staff as quickly as you can</strong>. Your child’s teachers will be trained in spotting and handling bullying and can work with you to prevent further bullying.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>your child needs to know that you’re working on the problem</strong>, so make sure that you tell him you’ll talk to the teacher about it.</p>

<p>Here’s<strong> how to work with your child’s preschool teacher </strong>to stop bullying:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make a time to speak privately with the teacher.</li>
	<li>Calmly present your concerns as a joint issue for you both to deal with. For example, ‘Cassie says Tyler is hitting her at preschool, calling her names and telling the other kids not to play with her. I’d like your help to find out what’s happening and what we can do about it’.</li>
	<li>Discuss the problem with the teacher. Ask for the teacher’s views. You could also ask how the preschool teaches children about emotions and how to treat other people.</li>
	<li>Be assertive, not angry or accusatory. For example, ‘Yes, children do tease sometimes. But I don’t agree this was just teasing. I think it’s more serious’.</li>
	<li>End the meeting with a plan for how the situation will be managed. For example, ‘You’re going to talk to the other teachers about this so they can watch the children carefully around the climbing frame. And we’re going to talk again next week’.</li>
	<li>Keep in touch with the teacher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Contacting the bully or the bully’s parents directly is likely to make the situation worse. It’s <strong>always safer to work with your child’s teacher</strong> rather than to try to solve bullying on your own.</p>

<p>Not all aggression is bullying at this age. Some preschoolers are aggressive because they haven’t yet learned the right language and social skills. Your child’s teacher is trained to know the best approach to take if another child is behaving aggressively towards your child.</p>

<h2>If the bullying doesn’t stop</h2>

<p>If the bullying at preschool doesn’t stop, it’s still safest to work through your preschool than to take matters into your own hands.</p>

<p>If your first meeting with the preschool teacher hasn’t solved the problem, here are the <strong>next steps</strong> to try:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep a record of what happens and when. If the bullying involves physical harm or damage to your child’s property, you could also take photos.</li>
	<li>Write a note to the teacher saying that the bullying is still going on. Ask for your concern to be addressed in writing.</li>
	<li>If the problem doesn’t seem to be getting better over time, speak to the preschool director or someone from the preschool management committee.</li>
	<li>If you’re not satisfied with the results of your meeting with the director or committee, ask to make a formal complaint. Most preschools have a procedure for handling grievances.</li>
</ul>

<p>It takes time to change behaviour, so <strong>you might not see overnight results</strong>.</p>

<p>If the bullying continues and you think the preschool isn’t doing enough to stop it, you might <strong>consider looking for another preschool with a better record</strong> of addressing bullying. Your child’s development is best supported by a safe and healthy environment. It won’t be good for him to stay in an environment where he feels really unhappy.</p>

<h2>What your child can do to cope with preschool bullying</h2>

<p>If your child is being bullied, you should always step in. But <strong>your preschooler can also learn ways to cope with the bullying</strong> when it’s happening. This can help her to handle any future bullying or negative social behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some ideas</strong>, along with ways to explain the ideas to your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tell the person doing the bullying to stop: ‘Standing up to bullies in a calm way lets them know that what they’re trying to do isn’t working’.</li>
	<li>Stay around other people: ‘If you play with your best friends, the person doing the bullying probably won’t bother you’.</li>
	<li>Ask other children for help: ‘Other children probably understand what you’re going through and can help you if you need it. Bullies are less likely to strike if they can see that you have backup’.</li>
	<li>Tell the teacher: ‘Your teacher can help you deal with the problem. The person doing the bullying might not even know that the teacher is helping you. Bullying can be hard to handle, and grown-ups are there to help’.</li>
</ul>

<p>You and your child could pick one or two ideas that he feels comfortable using. Encourage him to put them into action. This will help your child feel more confident and less powerless about being bullied.</p>

<h2>Supporting your child at home</h2>

<p>At home your child needs lots of <strong>support and love</strong> while you and the preschool teacher work on stopping the bullying.</p>

<p>You could aim to have a time each day when you chat with your child about the good and bad parts of her day. Rather than always asking about bullying, you can ask more general questions like ‘What was the most fun part of your day?’</p>

<p>Sometimes professional support might help your child deal with bullying. You can ask your GP or the preschool teacher about where you can go for professional help.</p>

<p>What if your child is the one doing the bullying? It can be hard to understand and accept, but there are things you can do if your child is bullying others.</p>",1341,56,"52,57,58",59,60,"936, 546, 1036",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/bullying/preschool-bullying-helping"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/bullying/preschool-bullying-helping</a></p>

856,Relationships with preschoolers: ideas and tips,"Key points

Warm and responsive relationships with parents are key to preschoolers’ development and wellbeing.
Relationships with preschoolers change as feelings become more complex and thinking and talking skills develop.
Strengthen relationships by listening and talking with preschoolers, doing everyday things together, and giving positive attention.","<h2>About relationships with preschoolers</h2>

<p>Warm relationships are so important to your child's well-being.</p>

<p>When you have this kind of relationship with your preschooler, he feels safe and secure. A sense of security gives your preschooler comfort during times of crisis like the global pandemic.  It also builds her confidence to explore the world and learn. And as your preschooler explores the world, he learns how to think, understand, communicate, behave, show emotions and develop social skills.</p>

<h2>Your relationship with your preschooler: what to expect</h2>

<p>At this age, your preschooler's  developing language, problem-solving skills and social skills. Your relationship might change as a result.</p>

<p>As your preschooler’s ability to use and understand language develops, you’ll start to have <strong>longer conversations</strong>. These conversations give you the chance to really listen to your child’s thoughts and feelings. This is great for your relationship with your child.</p>

<p>You might find that your preschooler has lots of ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘where’, ‘who’ and ‘how’ questions about the world around him. He can also understand more complex explanations.</p>

<p>Preschoolers are better at understanding and using words to express emotions like ‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘angry’ or ‘surprised’. And they can begin to understand that other people have these feelings too. These developing <strong>emotional skills</strong> are good for her relationships with you and other people, now and in the future.</p>

<h2>Building a strong relationship with your preschooler: tips</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Show that you’re listening when your preschooler is talking. Stop what you’re doing, make eye contact, pay attention to your child’s body language, and use phrases like 'Really?’, ‘Go on’, or ‘And then what happened?’</li>
	<li>Give your child plenty of positive attention. This might mean making time to do your child’s favourite activities with her – for example, jigsaws or Lego. Even joining in briefly lets her know that you’re interested in what she’s doing and that you like spending time with her.</li>
	<li>Try to be patient with your preschooler’s questions and encourage his interests. If he asks you a question that you don’t know the answer to, you could look it up online together, or ask a friend or family member.</li>
	<li>If your preschooler asks about tough topics, answer in simple language and short sentences that your child can understand – for example, ‘Yes, it's hard not to play with your friends because of Covid19.  The reason is that we want to keep everyone healthy and safe.  Let's think about how you can talk on our phone with David about your new toy."" </li>
	<li>Play games together like ‘I spy’ or simple board or card games. Turn-taking games like these help your child learn to play cooperatively and get along with people.</li>
	<li>Read together. Regular reading with your preschooler creates a special time for strengthening your relationship.</li>
	<li>Whenever possible, have family meals together. Family meals can strengthen your family relationships and your child’s sense of belonging.</li>
	<li>Encourage your preschooler to help you around the house – for example, by setting the table or putting away laundry. This shows your preschooler that you trust him with responsibility. And chores help your preschooler feel ‘big’ and good about himself.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s also important to look after yourself.  Even spending a few minutes a day doing something you enjoy like going for a walk or reading a magazine can make a big difference to how you feel about the time you spend with your child. Looking after yourself is good for you, so it’s good for your relationship with your child and her development.</p>",876,56,"52,57,58",59,60,"546, 171, 516, 996, 1021, 521",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/connecting-communicating/connecting/connecting-with-your-preschooler"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/connecting-communicating/connecting/connecting-with-your-preschooler</a></p>",en,published
861,Talking and listening to preschoolers,"Key points
Preschoolers love using their developing language skills to understand and explain their world.
Preschoolers are starting to use words to describe feelings. They can also use longer sentences and tell longer stories.
When your child is talking, show her that you’re listening. And encourage her to listen and take turns in conversation.","<h2>Preschooler talking and listening: what to expect</h2>

<p>At 3-5 years, you might hear lots of talk and questions from your preschooler. This is because preschoolers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>need to practise new words, speech sounds and language skills</li>
	<li>are constantly fascinated by the world around them</li>
	<li>learn by talking with people who know more than they do.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Listening to your preschooler</strong></p>

<p>When you show your child that you’re listening, it sends the message that what your child is thinking and saying is important to you.</p>

<p>Here’s how to <strong>listen – and</strong> <strong>show your child that you’re listening</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stop what you’re doing and give your full attention to your child whenever you can.</li>
	<li>Get down to your child’s level and make eye contact.</li>
	<li>Tune in to your child’s body language. This can tell you a lot. For example, your child might be shaking with anger or jumping up and down with delight.</li>
	<li>When your child tells you something, summarise it back to check that you understand what he’s saying.</li>
	<li>Use phrases that show you’re interested. For example, you can say, ‘Really?’, ‘Go on’, or ‘And then what happened?’</li>
	<li>Nod, smile and be affectionate when your child is talking.</li>
	<li>Try to listen until your child finishes telling a story.</li>
</ul>

<p>Preschoolers love to talk and tell stories! If you can’t listen right now, let your child know. For example, ‘We’re almost at preschool. Would you like to finish the story quickly now or tell me the rest later?’ Make sure to follow through later.</p>

<h2>Talking to your child</h2>

<p>Your child can use and understand a lot of words, but she still might have trouble understanding what you’re saying sometimes.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas that can help you talk and communicate clearly with your preschooler:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try to <strong>say exactly what you mean</strong>. Your child might not understand jokes, exaggeration or sarcasm and you might hurt his feelings.</li>
	<li>Make sure your body language and facial expressions match what you’re saying. For example, smile and make eye contact when you tell your child you love her.</li>
	<li>If your child can’t understand what you’re saying <strong>repeat the same message in a couple of different ways</strong>. For example, ‘Put your bag on the hook’ and ‘Pick up your bag and hang it on the hook’.</li>
	<li>Help your child learn ‘why’ by explaining things when you’re speaking. For example, ‘We don’t ride bikes on the road because we might get hit by a car’.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to take turns when you’re talking together. Taking turns to talk also builds your child’s listening skills.  ""Anna, it's my turn to talk.  Very soon you can have a turn!""</li>
	<li>Give your child lots of specific praise and encouragement for good communicating. For example, ‘Thanks for finishing the story when it was time to eat lunch’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Answering your child’s questions</h2>

<p>When you take your child’s questions seriously and <strong>take the time to give a real answer</strong>, you encourage your child to keep asking questions. This helps your child to learn about the world.  ""Hmmm, I don't know the answer to that myself.  It's a hard question. Let's ask your grandmother the next time we talk.""</p>

881,Dental care for newborns,"Most first teeth appear at 6-10 months, but babies get teeth at different times. When teeth arrive, brush twice a day with water and a soft infant toothbrush. Avoid tooth decay by feeding your newborn only breastmilk or infant formula. Don’t give your baby a bottle in bed.","<h2>Baby teeth development</h2>

<p>Babies are born with a full set of 20 baby teeth hidden in their gums – 10 up the top and 10 down the bottom. As each baby tooth gets to the surface of the gum, the gum opens up to show the tooth.</p>

<p><strong>Most first teeth appear between 6 and 10 months</strong>, but children get teeth at different times. In some children, teeth appear as early as three months. In others, they don’t arrive until around 12 months.</p>

<p>A very small number of children are born with one or two teeth.</p>

<p>Most children will have their full set of baby teeth by three years of age.</p>

<h2>Dental care for baby teeth</h2>

<p>As soon as the first tooth appears, use a soft infant toothbrush designed for children under two years. If your baby doesn’t like the toothbrush in his mouth, you can use a clean, damp face washer or gauze.</p>

<p>Brush with <strong>water only </strong>at least twice a day, particularly after the first and last feeds. Don’t use toothpaste at this age, unless recommended by your dentist. Find out how to brush baby teeth in dental care for babies.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to see your dentist if your baby is born with teeth or when her first tooth comes through.</p>

<h2>Preventing early tooth decay</h2>

<p>Baby teeth are at risk of decay as soon as they come through. The fight against tooth decay starts early with a couple of simple precautions.</p>

<p>Babies aged 0-6 months need <strong>only breastmilk or formula</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t put your baby to sleep with a bottle.</strong> When your baby is asleep, there’s less saliva in her mouth to protect her teeth. If your baby falls asleep with a bottle, formula or milk might slowly drip into your baby’s mouth and soak her teeth. This puts her at risk of tooth decay. Also note that putting your baby to sleep with a bottle is a choking risk.</p>

<p>If your baby likes a <strong>dummy</strong>, don’t dip it into food or liquids like honey or sugar. And don’t clean your baby’s dummy by putting it in your mouth. Make sure to wash and sterilise it instead.</p>",5456,2,"43,44,45",59,60,"1061, 1066, 1071, 1076, 1081, 1091",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/dental-care/dental-care-newborns"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/dental-care/dental-care-newborns</a></p>",en,published
886,Bedwetting,"Bedwetting or enuresis is when children who are toilet trained wet the bed at night without meaning to. Bedwetting is most common in children under seven years, but it also happens in older children. There are things you can do about it. It is  imporatnat to see your doctor if your child started again with bedwetting after she was already ""dry' at night.","<h2>Causes of bedwetting</h2>

<p>Bedwetting happens when children don’t wake up during the night when they need to do a wee. Children don’t wet their beds on purpose.</p>

<p>There are <strong>a few different causes</strong> of bedwetting in children.</p>

<p>Some children wet the bed because they sleep very deeply, some of them produce larger than usual amounts of wee at night, and some children have small bladders, which means they’re more likely to wet the bed at night.</p>

<p>Bedwetting often runs in families. If you wet the bed as a child, your own children might also be more likely to wet the bed. This doesn’t mean it’s your fault if your child wets the bed.</p>

<p>Bedwetting can be frustrating and worrying for you at times, so it’s good to know that there are effective bedwetting treatments out there that can help your child.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of bedwetting</h2>

<p>Bedwetting happens at night. Some children wet the bed every night. Others wet only a few times a week, once a week or once a month.</p>

<p>Daytime wetting is accidental wetting during the day while your child is awake. It’s much less common than bedwetting. Daytime wetting is more often caused by a medical condition or stress. Speak to your doctor if your child has daytime wetting.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about bedwetting</h2>

<p>If you’re worried about your child’s bedwetting, or if it’s causing issues for your child and your family, you might like to see your doctor for advice about treatment and management.</p>

<p>For example, it might be a good idea to see the doctor if your child is still wetting the bed regularly at seven years old and:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you’re concerned about how your child will handle sleep-overs or overnight school camps</li>
	<li>bedwetting is starting to bother or worry your child.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>It is very imporatnat to see your doctor if your child started again with bedwetting after she was already ""dry' at night</strong> since this might be the first symptoms of serious condition such as infection or diabetes or it might be related to emotional stress such as birth of a new brother or sister.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Treatment for bedwetting</h2>

<h3>Lifting and waking:</h3>

<p>Lifting is when you lift your child out of bed while he’s still asleep and take him to the toilet to do a wee. Waking is when you wake your child and take him to the toilet to do a wee. You can do this before you go to bed yourself, or at a set time during the night.</p>

<p>Lifting and waking can help to stop bedwetting in the short term, but it <strong>usually doesn’t stop bedwetting altogether</strong>. It isn’t a long-term solution.</p>

<h3>Drinking fluids:</h3>

<p>It’s important for your child to drink water regularly throughout the day to stay hydrated, even if she wets the bed.</p>

<p>If your child has plenty of water during the day, he might be able to avoid drinking too much fluid before bedtime. Drinking too much fluid before bedtime might increase your child’s need to wee during the night and lead to bedwetting. If your child is thirsty before bedtime, it could be a sign he hasn’t had enough to drink during the day.</p>

<p>It’s best for your child to avoid any drinks with caffeine in the evening – for example, cola, tea, coffee or hot chocolate. These drinks increase the amount of wee your child makes.</p>

<h3>Bedwetting alarms:</h3>

<p>A bedwetting alarm is a device that makes a noise and wakes your child when she wets the bed.</p>

<p>Bedwetting alarms work by training your child to wake up when she starts to wet the bed. They help your child start to recognise when her bladder is full and learn to hold on, or wake up and go to the toilet. The idea is that when the alarm goes off, your child wakes up before fully emptying her bladder.</p>

<p>If you decide to use a bedwetting alarm, it can be a good idea to sleep in your child’s room for the first week or so, so that you can help him get up quickly and get to the toilet. You might also need to comfort him if he’s distressed or confused by the sound of the alarm.</p>

<p>Your doctor will be able to tell you whether a bedwetting alarm is the right option for your child and family.</p>

891,External ear infection,"Key points: Symptoms of an external ear infection include pain and itchiness. The ear usually feels blocked. Your child might get an external ear infection from swimming, cotton buds, eczema, dermatitis and so on. Take your child to the GP if you think he has an external ear infection.","<h2>About external ear infection or otitis externa</h2>

<p>If your child has an external ear infection, the lining of her ear canal on the outer side of her eardrum is infected.</p>

<p>Children who swim a lot often get external ear infections. This is because water stays in their ears after swimming and causes irritation.</p>

<p>External ear infections might also happen if your child’s ear canal is damaged by using cotton buds or scratching. A secondary bacterial or fungal infection often develops when this happens.</p>

<p>Children who have skin problems like eczema or dermatitis are more likely to get external ear infections.</p>

<p>The medical term for external ear infection is otitis externa. You might also hear it called ‘swimmer’s ear’.</p>

<p>The ear has three main parts – the outer ear (the ear canal and ear lobe), the middle ear (behind the eardrum), and the inner ear (which has the nerves that help to detect sound).</p>

<h2>Symptoms of external ear infection</h2>

<p>If your child has an external ear infection, he might complain of a painful or itchy ear. Younger children might spend a lot of time scratching their ears.</p>

<p>The ear usually feels blocked, and your child might have trouble hearing. Chewing can sometimes make the pain worse.</p>

<p>Sometimes there can be bleeding or even discharge from the infected ear. Your child might also have painful, swollen lymph glands around her ear and neck.</p>

<p>Severe external ear infections can cause the whole ear to become red and swollen. </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about an external ear infection?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to your doctor if:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>your child complains of a disturbing earache</li>
	<li>there’s discharge from your child’s ear</li>
	<li>the whole ear becomes red and swollen</li>
	<li>your child is generally unwell, has a fever or is vomiting</li>
	<li>your child keeps getting external ear infections</li>
	<li>you think your child is having trouble hearing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment for external ear infection</h2>

<p>For usual external ear infections, your doctor might prescribe ear drops for your child for several days. These usually have a combination of corticosteroids and antibiotics in them. </p>

<p>For more severe external ear infections, your doctor might insert a small length of gauze, called a wick, into your child’s ear. The wick is soaked in a solution of antibiotics and corticosteroids.</p>

<p>While your child has an external ear infection, you and your child should avoid touching or scratching her ear. Your child’s ear also needs to be kept dry, which means she shouldn’t swim until her ear is completely healed.</p>

<p>You can use paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses if your child is in pain.</p>

<h2>Prevention of external ear infection</h2>

<p>If your child keeps getting external ear infections, it might help to dry his ears and put drops after swimming and bathing. Wearing good-quality earplugs can also help prevent this condition.</p>

<p><strong>It’s also a good idea to avoid cleaning your child’s ear with cotton buds</strong>. You could try using a hair dryer instead of cotton buds to dry your child’s ears.</p>",6686,2,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1111, 1116, 1121, 1126, 1131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/external-ear-infection"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/external-ear-infection</a></p>",en,published
921,Colic: what to do,"All babies cry. It’s a normal part of development. When babies cry a lot, it’s often called colic. Here are some things you can do if you think your baby has colic.","<h2>When you think your baby has colic: what to do</h2>

<p>The first step is to <strong>take your baby to your doctor</strong> for a check-up. This will make sure there’s nothing physically wrong. It will also reassure you.</p>

<p>Also, a <strong>child and family health nurse can check your feeding technique</strong> and let you know whether there’s anything you might be able to adjust. The nurse can also let you know about settling programs and early parenting centres in your area.</p>

<p>As a parent, it’s easy to feel that you have to look after your baby, keep a spotless home, work, shopping, cooking etc. . This is just impossible. You, your family and your baby will suffer if you’re feeling stressed from trying to do too much.</p>

<p>It’s very important to get enough rest, sleep and time to yourself, by doing this you’ll be in better shape to care for your baby.</p>

<h2>Coping with colic: 10 tips</h2>

<p><strong>Crying and fussing is a normal part of development</strong> for most babies. It will pass in time. But here are some ideas that might help cut down on how often, how long and how intensely your baby cries and fusses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Check whether your baby is comfortable. See whether his nappy needs changing, or whether he’s too hot or cold.</li>
	<li>Offer a feed if you think your baby might be hungry, or if the last feed was more than two hours ago.</li>
	<li>Offer a dummy or the breast. Sometimes your baby isn’t hungry but wants or needs to suck. If she’s 3-4 months or older, you could also help her find her own fingers or thumb to suck.</li>
	<li>Speak softly to your baby, sing to him or play soft music. He might just want to know you’re nearby, and your voice might soothe him. White noise can also be soothing for some babies. You could try a fan, a vacuum, or a radio set to the static between stations.</li>
	<li>Gently rock or carry your baby in a baby carrier or sling. Sometimes movement and closeness to a parent can soothe babies.</li>
	<li>Take your baby for a walk in the pram. But note that it isn’t recommended to leave your baby sleeping unsupervised in a pram.</li>
	<li>Try baby massage. Your family health nurse can teach you how to do baby massage.</li>
	<li>Give your baby a warm bath. This might settle your baby and help her sleep.</li>
	<li>Calm things down by dimming the lights, which helps to reduce stimulation.</li>
	<li>Try to establish a pattern to feeding and settling.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can experiment to see which strategies best suit your particular situation. Sometimes strategies that work well one day might not work the next day. If one of these strategies doesn’t work or stops working after a while, just try another.</p>

<p>These approaches won’t magically stop your baby crying, but they might make things easier.</p>

<p>You can’t spoil your baby by picking her up, or by cuddling or talking to her. Feed your baby whenever you think she’s hungry, and pick her up to comfort her when she’s crying.</p>

<p><strong>Other Treatments such as colic medications and mixtures, chiropractic treatment are not of proven help.</strong></p>

<p>Measure such as probiotic supplements, changing mother diet ,anti reflux medications and changing formula are rarely justified and only follwing consultation with your doctor.</p>

<h2>When to see your GP about colic</h2>

<p>It’s a good idea to see your GP early on if you think your baby has colic. If you’ve seen your doctor and you’re still concerned about your baby’s behaviour, it’s OK to talk with the GP again.</p>

<p><strong>You should definitely</strong> <strong>see the GP again if</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the strategies above don’t help with your baby’s crying</li>
	<li>your baby seems listless or pale</li>
	<li>your baby isn’t feeding well or gaining much weight</li>
	<li>your baby has a fever</li>
	<li>your baby has persistent vomiting or diarrhoea</li>
	<li>you’re afraid you might hurt your baby</li>
	<li>you’re worried for any other reason.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for colic</h2>

<p>Investigations like blood tests or X-rays rarely find any problems in babies with colic. The only time your baby would need tests is if the doctor thinks there might be an illness or infection that’s making your baby cry.</p>

<h2>Prevention of colic</h2>

<p>Colic seems to be a common phase that many babies go through. This means it’s difficult to prevent.</p>

<p>Very young babies who are carried a lot (using a sling), even when they’re not crying, have a tendency to cry and fuss less.</p>",7701,2,"43,44,45",59,60,"1141, 1146, 1151, 1156",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/colic-what-to-do"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/colic-what-to-do</a></p>",en,published
931,Your newborn’s first week: what to expect,"Your newborn spends her first week feeding, sleeping and bonding with you. You can bond with your newborn by spending time cuddling, talking and smiling. If you are concerned about your baby, seek advice from your doctor or nurse.","<h2>About your newborn’s first week of life</h2>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>Your newborn spends his first week of life adapting to his new environment.</p>

<p>The outside world is very different from the womb, where it is dim, the temperature is constant, and noise is muffled. You can help your baby get used to the outside world by giving her warmth, love, security, attention – and lots of cuddles and smiles.</p>

<h2>Changes in your newborn’s appearance in the first week of life</h2>

<p>Your baby’s appearance will change over the first week.</p>

<p>If your baby’s <strong>head is a bit cone shaped</strong> after his journey through the birth canal or because of a vacuum-assisted birth, it should round out to a more normal-looking shape.</p>

<p>Any <strong>swelling around your baby’s face</strong> and eyes will go down within a few days. If your baby’s face or head has been bruised – for example, after a forceps birth – the bruising will disappear. Babies with bruising are at risk of newborn jaundice. Let your health professional know if the skin on your baby’s face looks yellow and you think she might be jaundiced.</p>

<p>Your baby’s <strong>umbilical cord</strong> will gradually dry, become black and then fall off, usually within the first 10 days. Try to keep the umbilical cord clean and dry. If the area around the umbilical cord looks red or is sticky, let your child and nurse know.</p>

<p>Your baby might have one or more birthmarks, either at birth or later on. Birthmarks are common and usually do not need medical attention. But if your baby's birthmark concerns you or if it changes, it is a good idea to have it checked by your doctor or nurse.</p>

<h2>Feeding and sleeping in the first week of life</h2>

<p>Your newborn will sleep most of the time, waking up every few hours to feed. Newborns cannot ‘sleep through the night’. They have tiny tummies, so they need to wake and feed often.</p>

<p><strong>Most babies need feeds every 2-4 hours</strong>, and they have around 8-12 feeds every 24 hours. Sometimes feeds might last up to an hour when your baby is breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Your baby will usually wake himself when he needs to feed. But some babies might need to be woken for feeding – for example, babies who have lost a lot of weight, are very small, or are jaundiced.</p>

<p>It is likely to be a while before you see a pattern or routine of feeding and sleeping.</p>

<p>In the first few weeks, looking after yourself is important. This means eating well and doing some physical activity, and also sleeping when your baby sleeps, which will help you catch up on sleep. It is okay if you need to ask family and friends for help too.</p>

<h2>Development in the first week of life</h2>

<p>Your baby is learning a lot as you spend time together every day. Her brain is growing and developing as she sees, hears, smells and touches the world around her.</p>

<p>Your baby will close his hands involuntarily in the grasp reflex and will startle at sudden loud noises. He is also likely to have sudden jerky movements while asleep.</p>

<h2>Bonding and communicating in the first week of life</h2>

<p>Your newborn recognises your voice – after all, she has been listening to you from inside the womb for the past nine months. You can communicate with your newborn using your voice, touch, sight and smell.</p>

<p>Your baby will have his own ways of communicating with you using his behaviour – even though he cannot smile just yet. During this first week, you will start getting to know your baby’s cues and body language.</p>

<p>Lots of gentle touch, cuddling, smiling and gazing will help your baby feel safe and secure with you. This helps to promote bonding and attachment and healthy development. It’s also good for your baby’s brain development.</p>

<h2>Common health problems in the first week of life</h2>

<p><strong>Weight loss</strong><br />
It is normal for your baby to lose weight during the first five days after birth as she loses excess fluid. This weight loss should not be more than 10% of her birth weight, though. Most babies regain their birth weight after 1-2 weeks. If your baby has lost too much weight, she might have to stay in hospital with you for a little longer to make sure she is feeding well and gaining weight each day.</p>

<p><strong>Sticky eye </strong><br />
It’s common for babies to develop sticky or discharging eyes during the first few weeks of life. The most common cause is blocked tear ducts, and this usually gets better by itself. Gentle eye cleansing and massage will help. But it is best to have your doctor or nurse check your baby’s eyes if they are red and sticky.</p>

<p><strong>Rashes </strong><br />
Newborn babies can develop all sorts of rashes, which usually are not serious. But if your baby has a rash, it is best to have your doctor or nurse check it out. Common rashes include cradle cap, nappy rash, heat rash, eczema, milia and dry skin.</p>

<p><strong>When to see your doctor or nurse</strong><br />
If something does not seem right and you are worried about your newborn, seek medical help. Contact the health professionals at the unit where your baby was born, your doctor or nurse.</p>

<p>Seek medical help as soon as possible if your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is not feeding – for example, he is taking half the normal volume or number of feeds in a 24-hour period or vomits more than half of three feeds in a row</li>
	<li>has fewer than 6-8 wet nappies per day</li>
	<li>seems irritable, lethargic or very tired all the time or is hard to wake for feeds</li>
	<li>has pale or yellow skin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Crying in the first week of life</h2>

<p>It is <strong>normal for newborns to cry</strong>, but it can be stressful if you do not know what your baby is trying to tell you. Your newborn might cry because she:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is hungry</li>
	<li>has a wet or dirty nappy</li>
	<li>feels uncomfortable (too hot or too cold)</li>
	<li>wants you close for reassurance.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your newborn is crying, you can try feeding him, changing his nappy, cuddling or rocking him, speaking or singing in a soothing voice, or giving him a warm relaxing bath. If your baby is crying a lot, it does not mean you are doing a bad job as a new parent.</p>

<p><strong>When to seek help for crying</strong><br />
If you think your newborn is crying too much or you are having trouble coping, speak to your doctor or nurse as soon as you can.</p>

<p>In particular, seek medical help if your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has a high-pitched cry (like a cat’s)</li>
	<li>seems to have a weak cry or is moaning</li>
	<li>is crying for long periods of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Crying is a newborn’s main way of telling you what she needs.</p>

<h2>After the first week: baby health check-ups</h2>

<p>Usually the nearest baby health centre provides free check-ups for your baby, usually at two, four and eight weeks after birth.</p>

<p>When you go for your baby’s check-ups, it is a good time to ask questions about anything from rashes to vomiting to crying. You could write a list of questions before the check-ups so you do not forget to ask the nurse anything you want to know.</p>",2151,6,43,59,60,"1221, 1226, 1231, 1236",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/pregnancy/labour-birth/first-week-of-life/newborns-first-week"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/pregnancy/labour-birth/first-week-of-life/newborns-first-week</a></p>",en,published
936,Vitamin D: what you need to know,"Vitamin D helps bones grow, develop properly and stay strong. Children get most of their vitamin D from sunlight as well as a small amount from some foods. If you’re worried your child has a vitamin D deficiency, it’s a very good idea to talk with your GP.","<h2>Why children and adults need vitamin D</h2>

<p>Children need vitamin D for bone growth and development. So do babies developing in the womb. Vitamin D helps us absorb calcium.</p>

<p>Serious vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets, delayed motor development, muscle weakness, aches and pains, and fractures.</p>

<p>Vitamin D deficiency in adults has also been linked to osteoporosis, some cancers, heart disease and diabetes.</p>

<p>If women don’t get enough vitamin D during pregnancy, their children might develop neonatal hypocalcaemia (not enough calcium in the blood) or rickets later in childhood.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D and sunlight</h2>

<p>Your child needs sunlight on her skin for her body to make vitamin D. She gets about 80% of her vitamin D this way.</p>

<p>Scientists aren’t sure exactly how much sun children need for good levels of vitamin D. But we do know that the amount of sun your child needs depends on <strong>where you live and the time of year</strong>.</p>

<p>It also depends a bit on your skin colour. People with naturally very dark skin need 3-6 times more sun to make vitamin D than the amount fair-skinned people need.</p>

<p>The picture below shows <strong>how much sun should be enough</strong> to help your child's body make vitamin D, without putting his skin at risk of sun damage.</p>

<p>No matter where you live, you have to be careful about how much sun your child gets on her skin. Too much sun can lead to sunburn, skin damage and even skin cancer. This is why it’s important to use sun protection.</p>

<p>During summer, especially between 10 am and 4 pm, make sure your child stays safe in the sun with sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, clothing that keeps the sun off and access to plenty of shade.</p>

<p>To get more information and advice about how much sun is right for your child, speak with your GP.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D and food</h2>

<p>Most children won’t get enough vitamin D from food alone. But food with lots of vitamin D can add to the vitamin D your child gets from sunshine.</p>

<p><strong>Foods naturally containing vitamin D</strong> include fresh fatty fish (salmon, herring, mackerel and sardines), liver, some mushrooms and egg yolks.</p>

<p><strong>Some foods have vitamin D added to them.</strong> These include some low-fat dairy products, breakfast cereals and margarine. All infant formula contains vitamin D.</p>

<p>Your child can boost the benefits he gets from being out in the sun each day by doing some physical activity while he’s outside. This is because daily exercise helps your child’s body make vitamin D.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D deficiency</h2>

<p>Children might be at risk of vitamin D deficiency if they:</p>

<ul>
	<li>keep all their skin covered</li>
	<li>spend most of their time indoors and don’t get much or any sun</li>
	<li>have a condition affecting how the body controls vitamin D levels – for example, liver disease, kidney disease, conditions that cause problems with absorbing food (like coeliac disease or cystic fibrosis), and some medicines can affect vitamin D levels</li>
	<li>have darker skin</li>
	<li>have been breastfed for a long time and have a mother whose vitamin D is low.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Signs of vitamin D deficiency</strong> include rickets, delayed motor development, muscle weakness, aches and pains, and fractures.</p>

<h2>Treating vitamin D deficiency</h2>

<p>Talk with your GP if you’re worried about your child’s vitamin D levels, or you’re pregnant and think you might have low vitamin D.</p>

<p>Your GP can order a blood test, which is the best way to check vitamin D levels.</p>

<p>For <strong>mild deficiencies</strong>, your GP might say that your child needs to get a bit more sun.</p>

<p>If you or your child has a <strong>severe vitamin D deficiency</strong>, your GP might say you or your child should take vitamin D supplements, as well as getting more sun.</p>

<p>If you or your child can’t get more sun, the GP might say that taking <strong>vitamin D supplements</strong> is the best thing to do. You might take a vitamin D supplement in one large, single dose, or you might take a supplement for several weeks or months.</p>

<p>You can also talk to a dietitian about vitamin D supplements.</p>

<p>Solariums, sometimes called sunbeds or tanning beds, should never be used as a way to improve vitamin D levels or to treat vitamin D deficiency. Most states have a ban on commercial solarium operators. Solariums can cause skin cancer.</p>

<h2>Vitamin D, pregnancy and breastfeeding</h2>

<p>A baby’s vitamin D stores go up during development in the womb and go down after birth until the baby starts getting vitamin D from sunlight along with diet.</p>

<p>Breastfeeding babies don’t get much vitamin D from breastmilk, because breastmilk doesn’t have much. And if a breastfeeding mum has low vitamin D, she might not pass on enough vitamin D to her baby.</p>

<p>It’s recommended that breastfed babies with at least one other risk factor for low vitamin D, like dark skin, take a <strong>vitamin D supplement </strong>of 400 International Units IU or 10 micrograms (μg) a day. It’s a good idea to talk with your GP if you think your baby is at risk of vitamin D deficiency.</p>

<p>Infant formula has higher levels of vitamin D, so formula-fed babies don’t usually need a supplement.</p>

941,A new baby in your blended family,"It is normal for children to feel upset when they hear a new baby is coming. Talk early to your other children about the baby and involve them in planning and preparing. Try to keep children’s routines the same, especially in the early months. Introduce new routines gradually. When the new baby arrives, look for ways to make all children feel special.","<h2>Planning a new baby in a blended family</h2>

<p>A blended family consists of a couple, the children they have had together and their children from previous relationships.</p>

<p>If you are in a blended family and are thinking about having a baby with your partner, you might decide to tell your other children in advance that you are thinking about having a baby one day. You might say something like, ‘You never know – some day we might have another baby’.</p>

<h2>When you are expecting a new baby: how other children might feel</h2>

<p>A new baby in a blended family will be in a unique position – the baby will be the only person in the family who is biologically related to everyone.</p>

<p>Your other children might be excited when you tell them the new baby is coming. But it is also normal for children in any family to feel <strong>upset, worried or insecure </strong>in this situation. Being in a blended family can add to these feelings.</p>

<p>Sometimes your other children in a blended family can also feel threatened by a baby because:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>the pregnancy is getting lots of attention</li>
	<li>they are worried they will lose their special position as their parents' ‘baby’ or as the ‘only child’</li>
	<li>they are worried they will have less time or contact with their parent </li>
	<li>they are worried about practicalities like where the baby will sleep</li>
	<li>the baby belongs to both of you and they feel insecure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you are expecting a new baby: how you and your partner might feel</h2>

<p>It is normal to have a mix of feelings about a new baby – excitement, hope and concern about how your other children might react.</p>

<p>You and your partner might even feel differently about the baby, especially if one of you is a first-time parent. If this is your first baby, but your partner already has children, you might feel that your partner is not as excited as you. That is normal – all couples go through different feelings and stages during pregnancy.</p>

<p>However you are feeling, it is important to support each other through the pregnancy and talk about how you will prepare your other children for the baby’s arrival.</p>

<h2>Preparing other children for the new baby</h2>

<p>If you are pregnant, how you prepare your other children for a new baby depends on you. Your children’s ages will also play a part.</p>

<p>It can be good to introduce the idea of a new baby fairly early in the pregnancy, perhaps at least 3-4 months before the baby is born.</p>

<p>It is important to talk with your children about their concerns and reassure them. If they are upset or angry, hug them, reassure them and talk about the positives – for example, they will have a new brother or sister to play with.</p>

<p>Let them know there is plenty of time to get used to the idea.</p>

<p>It can also help to <strong>involve your children in planning and preparing </strong>for the baby in a way that interests them. If you can make this a positive and exciting time, your child is more likely to feel that the change is about everybody in the family, not just the new baby.</p>

<p>You can help your children feel involved by asking their opinions on things or getting them to help you choose some toys. Your children might like to be involved in experiencing the baby as it grows – for example, looking at ultrasound images or feeling the baby kick.</p>

<p>As you are preparing together with your children, <strong>try not to overdo the excitement</strong>. And if you are thinking about a special space or room for the baby, it is important to make sure that your other children have similar spaces too. If they do not, it is a good idea to make the space you are planning for the baby similar to what your other children have.</p>

<h2>After the new baby arrives: helping other children adjust</h2>

<p>As a couple, you can do a lot to help your other children adjust when you bring your new baby home. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>If your children are jealous of the baby, try to accept their feelings. But you can also let them know that you expect them to behave in a safe and gentle way around the baby.</li>
	<li>Look for ways to make all children feel special at different times – for example, on birthdays and when they achieve something, like a good grade at school.</li>
	<li>Keep your children’s routines consistent, especially in the early months. If you are going to make changes to family routines, try to do it gradually.</li>
	<li>Show your children how they can play safely with the baby, or give older children small responsibilities like walking the baby around the park in a pram. When children help out like this, congratulate them on being such a great big brother or sister.</li>
	<li>Tell grandparents and other adults like teachers the news and encourage them to give your other children extra attention and support if they are finding it difficult.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a step-parent, especially if this is your first child, you might find yourself withdrawing a little from your stepchildren as you become absorbed in the new baby. Try not to feel guilty about this. A few <strong>kind words or regular hugs each day </strong>will keep you and your stepchildren connected.</p>

<p>For tips on getting sibling relationships off to a good start, you can read more about helping toddlers and preschoolers adjust to a new baby and helping older children and teenagers adjust to a new baby.</p>

<h2>Your former partner and extended family</h2>

<p>Tell your former partner if you are expecting a new baby. It is much better if he or she hears it from you than from someone else. Your former partner might take a while to accept the news, even if you don’t think the news will cause hurt feelings.</p>

<p>Other family members might not react in the way you expect. For example, grandparents who have been very helpful with one set of grandchildren might feel worried they are too old to cope with future ones. Just try to reassure them that they can be as involved as they like.</p>",2181,4,"43,44,45,46",59,60,"1246, 1251, 1256, 1261, 1266, 1271, 1276, 1281, 1286, 1291, 1296, 1301",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/family-life/new-baby-in-the-family/new-baby-in-blended-family"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/family-life/new-baby-in-the-family/new-baby-in-blended-family</a></p>",en,published
946,After the baby is born: what to expect in the first hours,"What happens after birth depends on your labour, how your baby is born and how quickly your baby adapts to life outside the womb.You can bond with your baby as soon as he’s born if he’s breathing well and your health is stable. If your baby needs help to breathe, doctors and midwives will give your baby extra oxygen, a special breathing mask or breathing tube.","<h2>First minutes after baby is born</h2>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>The moment your baby is born can be both magical and stressful. What happens straight after birth will depend on your labour, how your baby is born, and how quickly your baby adapts to life outside the womb.</p>

<p><strong>Uncomplicated vaginal birth</strong><br />
Most babies breathe and cry within a few seconds of being born.</p>

<p>If it’s clear that your baby is breathing well he’ll be placed naked, skin-to-skin, on your chest or belly straight after birth. Skin-to-skin contact keeps your baby warm, helps to steady your baby’s breathing and heart rate, and lets you and baby bond physically straight away. It’s also a trigger for breastfeeding.</p>

<p>The midwife will dry your baby while your baby is on you, and cover you both with a warm blanket or towels.</p>

<p><strong>Forceps or vacuum birth</strong><br />
Most babies born with the help of forceps or a vacuum will breathe and cry at birth. But some babies might be a little stunned or slow to breathe, especially if they’re distressed during labour. If this happens, the midwife, obstetrician or paediatrician will take your baby to a special warming station. They’ll dry your baby and make sure she’s breathing well.</p>

<p>Once your baby is breathing properly, he’ll be dried, wrapped in warm towels or blankets, and given back to you. Then you can hold him and have skin-to-skin contact for bonding, warmth and breastfeeding.</p>

<p><strong>Elective caesarean section</strong><br />
Most babies born via elective caesarean section breathe and cry vigorously at birth. After your baby is born, the midwife or paediatrician will take your baby to a special warming station to dry her, assess her and check that she’s breathing properly.</p>

<p>The midwife or obstetrician will wrap your baby in warm blankets or towels and give him to you to hold while you’re on the operating table (unless you’ve had a general anaesthetic). Some hospitals provide for skin-to-skin contact when you’re in theatre, and you can ask whether this is an option at your baby’s birth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Unplanned (emergency) caesarean section</strong><br />
Babies born via unplanned caesarean section are more likely to need help to breathe at birth. The midwife or paediatrician will take your baby to a special warming station to dry her and assess what type of help your baby needs.</p>

<p>When your baby is breathing well and your health is stable, the midwife or obstetrician will wrap your baby in warm blankets or towels and give him to you to hold while you’re on the operating table (unless you’ve had a general anaesthetic).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Cutting the cord</strong><br />
After the birth of your baby, the umbilical cord needs to be clamped and cut. The cord is quite tough to cut, but cutting it isn’t painful for you or your baby.</p>

<p><strong>If your baby needs a lot of help </strong>to breathe at birth, or looks unwell your baby might need to go straight to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Your first cuddle might have to wait until your baby is well.</p>

<h2>How your baby will look and behave after birth</h2>

<p>Some important changes happen in your baby’s body as he moves from the protected, quiet and warm environment of your womb to the outside world. </p>

<p><strong>It’s normal for your baby to look somewhat blue</strong> or purple in the initial few minutes after birth. If your baby is breathing well, her skin colour will gradually become pink within 5-7 minutes after birth. Your baby’s hands and feet might stay blue for up to 24 hours. This is because the blood vessels in your baby’s hands and feet are very small, and it takes time for blood to circulate properly there and turn them pink.</p>

<p>If all is well, most babies cry immediately after birth. Most then quietly gaze with large open eyes at their surroundings before falling asleep. <strong>It’s normal for babies to fall asleep</strong>, but some might stay awake and want to feed.</p>

<p>If your baby seems ready, <strong>you can breastfeed</strong> him within a few minutes of birth. The midwife will help you attach baby to your breast.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>The Apgar score</h2>

<p>The Apgar score is a rating of your baby’s <strong>heart rate, breathing, muscle tone, response to stimuli and skin colour</strong>. A score of 0, 1 or 2 is given for each of these five criteria, and the total is the Apgar score. It is performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth.</p>

<p>Your baby’s Apgar score measures how well your baby has made the transition from life inside the womb to life outside. Apgar scores are recorded in your baby’s child health and development book.</p>

<h2> </h2>

<h2>Checks and medications in the first 24 hours</h2>

<p>Within the first hour of birth, the midwife will put two name tags on your baby.</p>

<p>Your baby will also be <strong>weighed</strong> at some time in the first few hours, and will have a physical check.</p>

<p>Your baby is supposed to have one or two injections into her thigh muscles soon after birth. The injections are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>vitamin K</strong> – this can help prevent a bleeding disorder caused by a vitamin K deficiency</li>
	<li><strong>hepatitis B immunisation</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>Within the first 48-72 hours of your baby’s life, she will have a newborn screening, which tests your baby for signs of rare conditions. Your baby will also be checked for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) and in some countries also screened for hearing impairment.</p>",6156,2,43,59,60,"1306, 71, 1311, 116, 1316, 1321",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/first-week-of-life/after-baby-is-born"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/first-week-of-life/after-baby-is-born</a></p>",en,published
971,Tooth decay,"Tooth decay can cause pain or infection. It can also affect growth and development. Signs of decay include white patches or brown spots on teeth, red or swollen gums, holes in teeth or broken teeth. If you think your child has tooth decay, see your dentist. Prevent decay with good dental care, healthy eating and drinking, and regular dental check-ups.","<h2>What is tooth decay?</h2>

<p>Tooth decay is <strong>a sugar-related disease that damages teeth</strong>.</p>

<p>Tooth decay happens when germs in the mouth create a sticky covering called plaque on the tooth surface. These germs feed on sugars in food and drinks and produce an acid that damages the tooth surface. Over time, this acid eats away at the surface of the tooth, creating holes or ‘cavities’.</p>

<p>Tooth decay can cause pain and infection. It can even affect children’s growth. Severe decay in baby teeth can have serious consequences for your child’s nutrition, speech, and jaw development.</p>

<p>The longer tooth decay is left untreated, the more your child will experience:</p>

<p>• pain and discomfort</p>

<p>• a higher risk of new decay in other baby and adult teeth</p>

<p>• more complicated and expensive treatment</p>

<p>• anxiety when he visits a dentist</p>

<p>• loss of time at school.</p>

<p>Tooth decay is also called <strong>dental caries</strong>.</p>

<h2>Signs of tooth decay</h2>

<p>The first sign of tooth decay is when teeth develop a dull, white band along the gum line.  </p>

<p>Later, you might notice blackened holes in the teeth or broken teeth. If the decay has led to an infection, you might notice swelling around the gums and face.</p>

<h2>Tooth decay prevention: three key steps</h2>

<p>There are three key steps your child can take to prevent tooth decay:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brush teeth twice a day, using fluoride toothpaste - <strong>Cleaning and caring for children’s teeth early on sets up good dental habits for life</strong>.</li>
	<li>Eat a healthy, low-sugar diet, and develop healthy eating habits.</li>
	<li>Have regular dental check-ups with the dentis - <strong>Regular dental check-ups can help your child avoid tooth decay.</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthy foods and drinks to prevent tooth decay</h2>

<p>Cleaning teeth isn’t a guarantee against tooth decay. The types of food and drink you give your child also affect dental health and the development of tooth decay.</p>

<p><strong>Babies under 4-6 months</strong><br />
Newborns and young babies need only breastmilk or formula.</p>

<p><strong>Babies over 6 months</strong><br />
When your breastfed or formula-fed baby is older than six months, she can also have small amounts of water. Avoid giving your baby sweetened milk, fruit juice or cordials.</p>

<p><strong>Older babies, children and teenagers</strong><br />
Children need a wide variety of healthy foods and snacks. Foods and drinks that are low in sugar are best. Try to minimize giving your children sweet biscuits or cakes. If your child does eat something sweet, drinking a glass of water or eating tooth-friendly food afterwards can reduce the amount of acid on your child’s teeth.</p>

<p>Tooth-friendly foods are low in sugar, promote chewing and get your child’s saliva going. Some good examples of tooth-friendly foods include cheese and chopped vegetables like carrot and celery.</p>

<h2>Healthy eating habits to prevent tooth decay</h2>

<p>Healthy eating habits can also prevent tooth decay. This means <strong>being careful about when and how your child eats</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, the longer food and drink stays in your child’s mouth, the more chance there is for acid to develop and damage tooth enamel. So grazing on foods and sipping drinks over long periods of time is more likely to cause tooth decay.</p>

<p>You can <strong>discourage your child from long periods of eating or drinking </strong>by:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>having regular snack and meal times, rather than letting your child ‘graze’ all day – aim to leave 1½-2 hours between meals and snacks, including sweet drinks</li>
	<li>making sure your child eats and drinks in one place only – for example, at the table</li>
	<li>putting food away when snack time or mealtime is over</li>
	<li>encouraging your child to drink tap water if he’s thirsty, rather than juice, cordial or soft drink</li>
	<li>giving your child sweet foods as part of a meal rather than as a snack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other ways to avoid tooth decay</h2>

<p><strong>Being a role model</strong><br />
You can set a good dental health example for your child by brushing your own teeth twice a day, limiting your sugar intake, and being positive about going for dental check-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Bottle-feeding and breastfeeding</strong><br />
It’s recommended that you don’t settle your baby in bed with a bottle of breastmilk or formula. Settling babies to sleep with bottles can lead to tooth decay. This is because there’s less saliva in your baby’s mouth to protect her teeth during sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Asthma inhalers or puffers</strong><br />
These are a vital part of some asthma management plans, but the powder in some puffers is acidic and can damage tooth enamel. This could lead to tooth decay over time if it isn’t balanced with good dental hygiene.</p>

<p>To avoid tooth decay, rinse your child’s mouth with water immediately after each use of the puffer.</p>",2311,2,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1361, 1366, 1371, 1376, 1381",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/dental-care/tooth-decay"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/dental-care/tooth-decay</a></p>

996,Medications for children: a guide,Children’s medicines are designed for children’s bodies. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are right for your child. Always check dosage instructions before giving medicine to your child. Call the Poisons Information Centre if you think your child has accidentally taken medication or has taken the wrong dose.,"<h2>Children’s medicines and medications</h2>

<p>Children need medications that have been specifically designed for their size and their needs. Some adult medications aren’t suitable for children.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure whether a medicine is suitable for your child, ask your doctor or phramacist. It’s recommended that you see a doctor before giving a baby under six months any medication.</p>

<p>Whenever you give your child medication, you need to check the dosage carefully.</p>

<p><strong>Always store medicines out of your child’s reach and in the original packaging.</strong></p>

<p>Call the Poisons Information Centre<strong> </strong>if you think your child has accidentally taken medication or has taken the wrong dose. If your child stops breathing, loses consciousness or is having seizures, call an ambulance immediately.</p>

<h2>Pain and fever medications: aspirin, paracetamol and ibuprofen</h2>

<p><strong>Aspirin<br />
Do not give aspirin to children under 12 years</strong> unless it’s prescribed by a doctor.</p>

<p>Aspirin can make your child susceptible to Reye’s syndrome, a very rare but potentially fatal illness. If you’re giving your child any over-the-counter medicines, check with your pharmacist or doctor to make sure they don’t have aspirin.</p>

<p><strong>Paracetamol</strong><br />
You can use paracetamol to treat pain like headache, stomach ache, earache, sore throat or fractures.</p>

<p>You can also give your child paracetamol if she has a fever that’s making her feel uncomfortable or unwell.</p>

<p>Paracetamol for children comes in different strengths and varieties, so <strong>read the label and follow the dosage instructions carefully</strong>, especially if you have children of different ages and weights in the household. Where possible, measure your child’s dose based on his weight rather than his age.</p>

<p>Paracetamol is safe if you give your child the right dose for short periods of time. But <strong>an overdose of paracetamol can be dangerous</strong>. It can even cause liver failure in severe cases. Ask your doctor if you aren’t sure about the recommended dosage for your child.</p>

<p><strong>Ibuprofen</strong><br />
You can use ibuprofen instead of paracetamol for pain and fever relief. It’s suitable for children over three months, but you should avoid using it if your child has severe asthma. Ibuprofen is best taken with food or on a full stomach.</p>

<p>It is also recommended not  to use ibufprofen if your child is dehydrated since the drug may cause kidney injury.</p>

<p>Always follow the instructions on the packaging when giving your child ibuprofen.</p>

<p><strong>Conditions that paracetamol and ibuprofen can’t help with</strong><br />
Paracetamol and ibuprofen won’t work for cough. They also won’t help children go to sleep.</p>

<p>Paracetamol or ibuprofen are found in many over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, so it’s important to read labels carefully to avoid accidental overdose.</p>

<p>If your child is in a lot of pain, especially before the next dose of medication is due, it’s OK to give paracetamol and ibuprofen. You can give them together or at different times, as long as you follow the instructions for each individual medication. Make sure to record when you give each medication so you don’t give your child too much.</p>

<h2>Antibiotics</h2>

<p>Antibiotics <strong>work only for</strong> <strong>infections caused by bacteria</strong> – for example, bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, middle ear infections and  infected wound.</p>

<p>Antibiotics <strong>won’t work for viral infections</strong> like colds or the flu.</p>

<p>Using antibiotics incorrectly can lead to side effects like diarrhoea, dehydration or allergic reactions.</p>

<p>Your doctor has many different antibiotics to choose from. Some are effective against only certain types of bacteria. Others target a broad range of bacteria and are called broad-spectrum antibiotics. Your doctor will try to choose the right antibiotic to fight the bacteria infecting your child.</p>

<p>Your doctor might suggest other ways of treating your child’s symptoms before prescribing antibiotics. It’s best not to pressure your doctor for antibiotics if the doctor says your child doesn’t need them.</p>

<p>If your child needs to take antibiotics, it’s very important that he <strong>takes the entire course of antibiotics</strong>, even if he seems better after a few days. Infection might come back a week or two later if the bacteria aren’t completely gone from his system.</p>

<p>Never use old, leftover antibiotics for new illnesses. And never give antibiotics to someone they haven’t been prescribed for – for example, another child in the family.</p>

<p><strong>Remember, overuse and misuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance</strong>. Preventing unnecessary antibiotic use is an important part of reducing antibiotic resistance.</p>

<h2>Cough and cold medications</h2>

<p><strong>Children under six years should not take cough and cold medications</strong>, including decongestant nasal sprays.</p>

<p>Children aged 6-11 years should take cough and cold medications only on the advice of a doctor. This includes decongestant nasal sprays.</p>

<p>Saline nasal sprays and drops are safe options for clearing blocked noses for children and babies.</p>

<h2>Antihistamines</h2>

<p>Itching, sneezing, swelling or rashes can all be symptoms of allergies or hayfever. Medications known as <strong>antihistamines</strong> are used to stop these symptoms.</p>

<p>Antihistamines can sometimes cause a dry mouth, drowsiness and upset stomach.</p>

<p>Antihistamines generally aren’t recommended for long-term use, so check with your doctor before giving them to your child.</p>

<p><strong>Antihistamines and sleep</strong><br />
Antihistamines, including promethazine aren’t recommended for helping children sleep, unless you use them under the supervision of your doctor. These medications sometimes cause daytime drowsiness, which might affect your child’s ability to learn.</p>

<p>Antihistamines can also have the opposite effect, causing some children to become hyperactive. This might make any sleep problems worse.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Medications to avoid</h2>

<p>Think very carefully before giving your child medications that haven’t been prescribed by a doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Anti-nausea medications</strong><br />
Don’t give your child anti-nausea medications unless the doctor specifically tells you to. Usually vomiting doesn’t last long, and children get over it without medication.</p>

<p><strong>A mix of prescription and over-the-counter medications</strong><br />
Mixing prescription medicine and over-the-counter medicine from a pharmacist can be very dangerous. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist first. And if you’re not sure what’s in a particular medicine, ask your pharmacist or doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Medications not meant for your child</strong><br />
Adult medications or medications prescribed for someone else might harm your child. It’s never safe to give these to your child.</p>

<p><strong>Expired medication</strong><br />
Expired medicine doesn’t work and can even be harmful.</p>

<p><strong>Chewable tablets</strong><br />
Young children can easily choke on chewable tablets. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before giving your child chewable tablets.</p>

<h2>Vitamins: a good idea?</h2>

<p>There’s no evidence that vitamin and mineral supplements help children’s health in any way unless the child has a deficiency of some kind – and very few children suffer from these deficiencies.</p>

<p>Check with your doctor if you think your child might have a vitamin or mineral deficiency.</p>

1001,Serious childhood illnesses: 0-3 years,"Call an ambulance if your child has symptoms like drowsiness, difficulty breathing, pale or blue skin, seizures or a rash that doesn’t fade. Go to emergency if your newborn has a fever, or your baby or child is feeding poorly, vomiting a lot and/or weeing less than usual.If you’re not sure whether your child is really sick, trust your instincts. You know your child best.","<h2>Serious childhood illnesses: what to do</h2>

<p>Babies and young children with the signs and symptoms listed in this article are at risk of serious illnesses.</p>

<p><strong>If you notice any of the problems listed below, seek medical attention as soon as possible.</strong> You know your child best, so trust your instincts if your child doesn’t seem well.</p>

<p>The quickest way to get immediate medical attention is to either call emergency services and ask for an ambulance, or take your child to the emergency department at your nearest hospital.</p>

<h2>When to call an ambulance for childhood illnesses</h2>

<p>If you notice any of the following signs and symptoms, <strong>call  and ask for an ambulance</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>drowsiness or unresponsiveness</li>
	<li>high-pitched, weak or continuous crying</li>
	<li>difficulty breathing or unusual breathing</li>
	<li>pale, blotchy or blue skin</li>
	<li>fits or seizures</li>
	<li>a rash that doesn’t fade when you press your child’s skin.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s more information about these signs and symptoms below.</p>

<p><strong>Drowsiness and unresponsiveness</strong><br />
It’s normal for your child to be sleepy sometimes – for example, after a feed. But if your child seems sleepier than usual, this can be a sign of serious childhood illnesses.</p>

<p>If you can’t wake your child even when you try really hard many times, get help immediately.</p>

<p>Unresponsiveness can be a sign of several serious childhood illnesses and conditions, including low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) or a life-threatening brain infection (meningitis).</p>

<p><strong>High-pitched, weak or continuous crying</strong><br />
All babies and young children cry. But if your child is crying in an unusual way, the crying doesn’t stop, and you have trouble settling your child, you should be concerned.</p>

<p><strong>Difficulty breathing or unusual breathing</strong><br />
If your child is having difficulty breathing, you might notice that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>she has to breathe much harder to get air into her lungs</li>
	<li>she has a persistent cough</li>
	<li>the muscles between her ribs pull in when she tries to breathe</li>
	<li>she can’t make any conversation or sounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>In severe cases, your child might look very tired and blue. He might be quiet or make a grunting noise with each breath.</p>

<p>These breathing symptoms might be caused by conditions like a chest infection (pneumonia) or severe asthma.</p>

<p><strong>Pale, blotchy or blue skin</strong><br />
Pale, blotchy or blue skin might be caused by poor blood circulation or low levels of oxygen in the body, both of which can happen in serious childhood illnesses.</p>

<p><strong>Convulsions or seizures</strong><br />
If your child is having a convulsion or seizure, her eyes might roll backwards. She might be unresponsive, shake violently in all limbs for a short time, and have shallow or unusual breathing.</p>

<p>Once the convulsion has stopped, roll your child onto his side on a soft surface, keeping his top leg bent. This is the recovery position. Don’t put anything (including your fingers) in your child’s mouth during this time. This might block your child’s breathing.</p>

<p><strong>Rash (positive glass test)</strong><br />
Skin spots or blotches that don’t fade when you press a glass firmly against your child’s skin can be an early sign of a life-threatening meningococcal infection.</p>

<h2>When to go to the hospital emergency department for childhood illnesses</h2>

<p>If you notice any of the following signs and symptoms, take your child straight to the nearest emergency department:</p>

<ul>
	<li>fever in babies less than three months old</li>
	<li>less wee than usual</li>
	<li>poor feeding</li>
	<li>frequent vomiting</li>
</ul>

<p>There is more information about these signs and symptoms below.</p>

<p><strong>Fever or high temperature above 38°C</strong><br />
A fever is a temperature higher than 38°C. It’s the body’s normal way of fighting infections. Most children with a fever don’t have a serious illness. But in some cases, a fever can be a sign of a more serious infection.</p>

<p>If your baby is <strong>under three months and develops a fever</strong>, a doctor needs to see her immediately. This is because it’s harder to tell whether children in this age group have serious underlying illnesses.</p>

<p>But if your child is <strong>over three months and doesn’t show other signs of serious illness</strong>, you could also take your child to the doctor, preferably on the same day.</p>

<p>Feeling your child’s skin temperature by putting your hand to his forehead isn’t a reliable way of diagnosing a fever. The best way to check your child’s temperature is by using a thermometer.</p>

<p><strong>Less wee than usual</strong><br />
An early sign of many serious illnesses is fewer wet nappies than usual – that is, fewer than half the number of wet nappies your child usually has each day. It could mean your child is dehydrated.</p>

<p><strong>Poor feeding</strong><br />
If your baby isn’t feeding well or has no interest in feeding, this could be an early sign of childhood illness.</p>

<p><strong>Frequent vomiting</strong><br />
Vomiting is a normal way for the body to get rid of something it doesn’t want. It can also be a sign of illness or infection.</p>

<p>Vomiting that doesn’t stop can cause dehydration and dangerous imbalances in the body’s chemical system.</p>

<p>Go to an emergency department if your child can’t eat or drink anything after several hours and is still vomiting especially if he doesn’t seem well.</p>

1006,Fever,Fever is a temperature higher than 38°C. It’s usually a sign of infection. Fevers in newborns and very young babies are serious and need medical attention. Most fevers in children don’t require medical attention. Keep children hydrated and give them pain medication if they’re uncomfortable.,"<h2>What is a fever?</h2>

<p>A normal temperature range for children is 36.5°C-38°C. A fever is when your child’s body temperature is higher than 38°C.</p>

<p>Fever is not an illness in itself, but is <strong>the sign of an illness</strong>.</p>

<h2>Causes of fever and high temperature in children</h2>

<p>Children get fevers for all kinds of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Infections are by far the most common cause of fever in children.</strong> In general, fever is a sign your child’s body is fighting an infection.</p>

<p>Most childhood infections are caused by viruses. Other infections might be caused by bacteria and other bugs. Infections that might cause fever may involve any part or system of the body.</p>

<p>There are other less common causes of fever. These include allergic reactions to drugs or vaccines, chronic joint inflammation, some tumours and gastrointestinal diseases like Crohn’s disease.</p>

<h2>Fever symptoms</h2>

<p>A <strong>high temperature might make your child feel uncomfortable</strong>. Your child might have chills or shiver when their temperature is rising, and they might sweat when it’s falling. Sometimes your child might become mildly dehydrated if they’re losing a lot of fluid from the fever and not drinking enough.</p>

<p>Children between the ages of six months and six years might have a febrile convulsion.</p>

<p>Most fevers and the illnesses that cause them last only a few days. But sometimes a fever will last much longer, particularly if it’s the sign of an underlying illness or chronic disease.</p>

<p>If you think your child has a fever, taking your child’s temperature with a thermometer will tell you whether your child’s temperature is higher than normal.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about fever and high temperature</h2>

<p><strong>Babies under three months</strong> with a fever should be taken to a hospital emergency department straight away. This is because it’s harder to tell whether they have a serious underlying illness.</p>

<p>In <strong>children aged 3-12 months</strong>, fever might be a sign of a more significant illness, so seek medical advice from your doctor within the same day.</p>

<p>In <strong>children over 12 months</strong>, go to a hospital emergency department or call an ambulance straight away if your child has a fever and also:</p>

<ul>
	<li>looks sicker than before – for example, your child is more pale, lethargic and weak</li>
	<li>has trouble breathing</li>
	<li>becomes drowsy or unresponsive</li>
	<li>seems dehydrated, refuses to drink or is weeing less often</li>
	<li>complains of a stiff neck, persistent headache or light hurting their eyes</li>
	<li>vomits persistently, or has frequent bouts of diarrhoea</li>
	<li>Has a skin rash does not fade when pressed with, and viewed through, a glass.</li>
	<li>suffers pain or is continuously crying</li>
	<li>is causing you to worry for any other reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>You know your child best, so trust your instincts if your child doesn’t seem well or is showing signs of a serious illness that requires urgent medical attention.</p>

<h2>Fever treatment</h2>

<p>Fever in itself is rarely harmful. Generally, children handle fever well.</p>

<p>You should treat a fever only if it’s making your child uncomfortable. A fever will run its course regardless of treatment.</p>

<p>If your child has a fever, the most important thing is to <strong>make sure your child is drinking enough to avoid dehydration</strong>:</p>

<p>You might need to give your child smaller amounts of fluid, but more often.</p>

<p>Here are some other things you can do to make sure your child is comfortable:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dress your child in light clothing.</li>
	<li>Give your child paracetamol in the recommended dose and frequency. You can also give ibuprofen to children aged over three months. Don’t give fever-lowering medication too often or for too long, because it can cause side effects like liver damage.</li>
	<li>Avoid cool baths, sponging and fans. These can actually make your child more uncomfortable.</li>
	<li>Don’t pressure your child to eat. If your child isn’t hungry during a fever, that’s OK.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child’s fever is caused by a bacterial infection, your child might need treatment with antibiotics to get rid of the infection.</p>

<p>Do not give your child aspirin for any reason. Aspirin can make your child susceptible to Reye’s syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness. It can also cause serious illness or even death in children with chickenpox or flu symptoms.</p>",6181,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"711, 1466",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/health-concerns/fever"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/health-concerns/fever</a></p>",en,published
1011,Taking your child’s temperature,The best way to check your child’s temperature is with a digital thermometer. Digital probe thermometers are the most accurate. They measure temperature under the tongue or armpit and sometimes rectally. Ear thermometers and temporal artery thermometers are easy to use but can be inaccurate.,"<p><strong>The average body temperature for children is about 37°C. If your child’s temperature is higher than 38°C, she probably has a fever.</strong></p>

<h2>Types of thermometers</h2>

<p>It’s best to <strong>check your child’s temperature using a thermometer</strong>. Feeling your child’s skin temperature by putting your hand to his forehead isn’t a reliable way of diagnosing a fever.</p>

<p>Most modern thermometers are digital thermometers.</p>

<p><strong>Digital probe thermometers</strong><br />
You can use a digital probe thermometer to take your child’s temperature in 3 main ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Orally</strong> (under the tongue):  you may use this methods for chldren older than 4 years. </li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Axillary (</strong>under your child’s armpit): You may use this method for chidren aged 3 month to 4 years. It is less accurate than oral or rectal temperature. </p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Rectal temperature.</strong>  this practice is not recommended by some experts since there’s a risk that the tip of the thermometer could damage the lining of the child’s rectum.  However this is the most accurate measurment and many expert believe that this is the best method for babies from birth to 3 months and may be also used for children aged 3 months to 4 years. </li>
</ul>

<p> You can clean a thermometer using warm soapy water or an alcohol wipe.</p>

<p><strong>Digital ear thermometers</strong><br />
Ear thermometers are quick and easy to use, but they can be  inaccurate.</p>

<p><strong>Digital forehead or temporal artery thermometers</strong><br />
These are the easiest types of thermometers to use, They can be used even while a child is asleep but they can be inaccurate.</p>

<p><strong>Other thermometers</strong><br />
Digital pacifier thermometers, fever strips and smartphone apps aren’t recommended because they’re not very accurate.</p>

<p><strong>Mercury thermometers can poison a child </strong>if they break and they are not recommeded. </p>

<h2>Taking your child’s temperature</h2>

<p>No matter what kind of thermometer you have, it’s important to <strong>carefully read the instructions</strong> that come with it before using it for the first time.</p>

<p>Here are more tips to help you take your child’s temperature accurately.</p>

<p><strong>Oral temperatures</strong><br />
You take an oral temperature using a probe thermometer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wait five minutes after your child has had a hot or cold drink.</li>
	<li>Place the thermometer well under one side of your child’s tongue.</li>
	<li>Have your child hold it in place with her lips, not her teeth, and tell her to breathe through her nose.</li>
	<li>Wait until the thermometer beeps and then check the digital display for the temperature reading.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Add 0.5°C</strong> to your child’s oral readings to estimate his true body temperature.</p>

<p>You can take oral temperatures in children <strong>over four years</strong>. It’s hard to take an oral temperature in children younger than this, because they can’t always co-operate with you.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Armpit temperatures</strong><br />
You take an armpit temperature using a probe thermometer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Place the thermometer in your child’s armpit.</li>
	<li>Close your child’s arm over the thermometer, holding his elbow against his body.</li>
	<li>Wait until the thermometer beeps and then check the digital display for the temperature reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking your child’s temperature under the armpit is usually the easiest way to do it, especially in young children. Unfortunately, it’s also less accurate than an oral temperature reading.</p>

<p><strong>Add  1°C</strong> to your child’s armpit readings to estimate her true body temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Rectal temperature:</strong> If you check rectal temperature, lubricate the tip of the thermometer with petroleum jelly. Lay your baby or child on her back, lift  her thighs, and insert the lubricated thermometer 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimeters) into the rectum. Alternatively, you can place your child on the belly on your lap or other firm surface. If you put your child belly down, put your hand against his or her lower back to hold the child in place. <strong>Never try to force a rectal thermometer past any resistance.</strong> Hold the thermometer in place until the thermometer signals that it's done. Remove the thermometer and read the number.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>When to see a doctor about fever and high temperature</h2>

<p><strong>Babies under three months</strong> who have a fever should be taken to a hospital emergency department straight away. This is because it’s harder to tell whether they have a serious underlying illness.</p>

<p>In <strong>children aged 3-12 months</strong>, fever might be a sign of a more significant illness, so seek medical advice from your doctor preferably within the same day.</p>

<p>In <strong>children over 12 months</strong>, go to a hospital emergency department or call an ambulance straight away if your child has a fever plus other signs of serious illness like severe pain, drowsiness, pale or blue skin, dehydration, troubled breathing, a stiff neck, persistent vomiting and reduced responsiveness.</p>

<p>If your child’s temperature doesn’t improve within 48 hours, see your doctor.</p>

<p>You can take your child’s temperature as often as you need to – for example, every 3-4 hours. But the most important thing is to watch your child for signs of serious illness.</p>",6181,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1471, 1476, 1491, 1496, 1501",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/health-concerns/taking-your-childs-temperature"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/health-concerns/taking-your-childs-temperature</a></p>",en,published
1021,Cradle cap,"Cradle cap is the oily, scaly crust that babies sometimes get on their scalps, in their body folds and on their torsos. Although cradle cap looks uncomfortable, it doesn’t usually bother your baby. It begins soon after birth and can last for up to 12 months.","<h2>Causes of cradle cap</h2>

<p>Cradle cap happens if your baby’s skin makes too much oil (sebum). This extra oil interferes with the natural shedding of skin on his scalp and creates a build-up of dead skin over the scalp. Your baby’s skin probably makes the extra oil because mum’s hormones are still circulating in his bloodstream after birth.</p>

<p>Cradle cap might also happen if your baby’s immune system overreacts to the presence of normal yeast on her scalp. This overreaction causes inflammation.</p>

<p>Cradle cap <strong>isn’t contagious, dangerous or serious</strong>.</p>

<p>Although cradle cap can cause hair to become matted, it <strong>won’t cause baldness or long-term hair loss</strong> in your baby.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of cradle cap</h2>

<p>Cradle cap usually looks like a pale yellow scale or crust at the back or on the top of your baby’s head. Sometimes the scale can also spread to your baby’s eyebrows and behind his ears. Some babies even get it on their torsos.</p>

<p>The scale or crust might have an oily texture. It’s difficult to peel off.</p>

<p>Cradle cap won’t bother your baby.</p>

<h2>When to see a doctor about cradle cap</h2>

<p>Take your child to the doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the cradle cap doesn’t improve after two weeks, despite the simple treatment described below</li>
	<li>the rash is red, or your baby is scratching at it</li>
	<li>the rash seems to be spreading</li>
	<li>your baby seems irritated by it</li>
	<li>you’re in any doubt that it is cradle cap.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cradle cap treatment</h2>

<p>Cradle cap doesn’t need to be treated. It usually clears by itself within a few months of birth, as mum’s hormones leave your baby’s bloodstream.</p>

<p>If you want to get rid of the scale, regularly massage baby oil or Vaseline into the crusts before bathing your baby. Use mild baby shampoo to wash this out. Over time, the crusts will soften and should lift off easily if you brush over them with a cotton bud or soft baby toothbrush.</p>

<p>Don’t force the crusts, because this might make your baby’s skin bleed.</p>

<p>If the crusts are inflamed, your doctor might prescribe a combination mild corticosteroid and anti-yeast cream. Put the cream on your baby according to instructions.</p>

<p>Babies very rarely need an over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoo. This can irritate your baby’s skin and eyes, so you should dilute it in water if you do use it.</p>

<p>Don’t be worried if the cradle cap comes back after treatment. This just means that your baby’s glands are still making extra oil. The cradle cap should clear by 6-12 months.</p>",6631,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,1521,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cradle-cap"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cradle-cap</a></p>",en,published

1031,Plagiocephaly,"Plagiocephaly is a misshaped or flat head.It can happen in the uterus or during birth. It can also develop in the early months of life. Plagiocephaly usually fixes itself as your baby grows, but sometimes treatment is needed. Help prevent plagiocephaly by giving your baby tummy time and alternating his head position.","<h2>About plagiocephaly or flat head</h2>

<p>Plagiocephaly is an uneven or asymmetrical head shape – a ‘flat head’. It can also be a flattened spot on the back or side of a baby’s head. Plagiocephaly can be mild, moderate or severe.</p>

<p><strong>Babies are often born with misshaped heads.</strong> This can be caused by the head’s position in the uterus during pregnancy, or it can happen because of the squashy passage down the birth canal.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>newborn skull bones are soft, thin and flexible.</strong> So plagiocephaly sometimes happens when babies lie with their heads in the same position for a long time.</p>

<p>Plagiocephaly can be caused by tight neck muscles which means babies have a strong preference for turning their heads to one side.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Plagiocephaly is generally considered a cosmetic issue</strong>, however, some babies with severe plagiocephaly might have a delay in the development of gross motor skills like rolling and crawling.</p>

<p>The proper medical name for this type of plagiocephaly is<strong> deformational plagiocephaly</strong>. There’s another type of plagiocephaly called synostotic plagiocephaly. It happens when a baby’s skulls bones don’t close orderly. This article is only about deformational plagiocephaly.</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms of plagiocephaly</h2>

<p>Your baby might have an uneven head shape, a flat head or flattened sections at the back or side of her head. Your baby’s ears might look uneven, and her forehead might be more prominent.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about plagiocephaly?</h2>

<p>•your baby has a strangely shaped head or a flat spot, which hasn’t gone back to a normal shape by about two months of age</p>

<p>•your baby has a strong preference for turning his head to one side, or has difficulty turning his head</p>

<p>•you’re concerned about your baby’s head shape.</p>

<h2>Treatment of plagiocephaly</h2>

<p>Often, <strong>mild plagiocephaly doesn’t need treatment.</strong> It’s likely to fix itself as your baby grows.</p>

<p>This is because your baby’s head shape will naturally improve as her head grows and her gross motor skills develop. When your baby starts to spend less time on her back and more time on her tummy or sitting, there’ll be less pressure on the back of her head.</p>

<p>If your baby needs treatment, your doctor or nurse might recommend you see a paediatric physiotherapist  who’ll develop a treatment plan.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment might include:</strong></p>

<p>•repositioning your baby so he avoids lying on the flat head spot when awake</p>

<p>•doing gentle exercises and stretches with your baby to improve his neck movements</p>

<p>•encouraging motor skills like rolling, reaching and turning</p>

<p>•giving your baby tummy time and time on his side when he’s awake</p>

<p>•carrying your baby in certain ways – your health professionals will advise you.</p>

<p><strong>For severe plagiocephaly,</strong> your specialist might recommend that your child wears a specially fitted helmet, which takes the pressure off the flat spot and allows your child’s head shape to improve as her head grows.</p>

<h2>Plagiocephaly prevention</h2>

<p>•Try to alternate your baby’s head position between right and left when he’s sleeping on his back.</p>

<p>•When using the change table or cot, alternate the end at which you place your baby’s head.</p>

<p>•When your baby is awake, give her tummy time or time on her side during supervised play.</p>

<p>•Stimulate your baby – for example, talk, sing or shake a rattle – or put toys near your baby on the side he likes least. This will encourage him to turn his head to that side.</p>

<p>Positioning your baby on her back for sleep is the safest sleeping position. Putting your child to sleep on her stomach or side increases the risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI).</p>",7706,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"1526, 1531, 1536, 1541",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/health-concerns/plagiocephaly"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/health-concerns/plagiocephaly</a></p>",en,published
1036,Allergies in children,"Allergies happen when your child’s immune system reacts to an allergen such as food, dust mites or pollen and more. Symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction include rash, swelling, tingling mouth or lips, sore stomach, vomiting, hay fever and asthma. Signs of anaphylaxis include difficulty breathing, a tight throat, a persistent cough and fainting. Seek urgent medical attention If you think your child has severe allergy.","<h2>How allergies happen</h2>

<p>Allergies happen when your child reacts to something in the environment. The thing that causes the reaction is called an allergen. It might be something like food, dust mites or pollen.</p>

<p>Allergens cause your child’s immune system to produc specific antibodies (IGE antibodies) that cause the release of histamine and other substances into his body. This leads to allergy symptoms.</p>

<p>Mild, moderate and even severe allergic reactions are common, but deaths from allergic reactions are rare. Deaths can happen when there’s a delay in giving life-saving medication to the person having the reaction.</p>

<p>Children who have family members with allergies or allergy problems like asthma, eczema and hay fever are at increased risk of also developing allergies.</p>

<h2>Allergic reactions: how quickly do they happen?</h2>

<p><strong>An immediate allergic reaction</strong> usually happens within minutes or up to 1-2 hours after your child comes into contact with or eats the substance that she’s allergic to.</p>

<p><strong>A delayed allergic reaction</strong> usually happens several hours after exposure. It can even happen up to several days after your child comes into contact with the substance he’s allergic to.</p>

<h2>Mild or moderate allergic reactions: symptoms</h2>

<p>If your child is having a mild or moderate allergic reaction, her symptoms might include one or more of the following:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>rash, hives or welts</li>
	<li>swelling of the face, eyes or lips</li>
	<li>tingling or itchy mouth</li>
	<li>eczema, hay fever or asthma – these symptoms might be worse than usual</li>
	<li>diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that if your child has <strong>diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting after an insect sting</strong>, it means he’s having a severe allergic reaction.</p>

<h2>Severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis: symptoms</h2>

<p>A severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Symptoms might include one or more of the following:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>difficult or noisy breathing</li>
	<li>tongue and throat swelling or tightness</li>
	<li>difficulty talking or a hoarse voice</li>
	<li>a wheeze or persistent cough</li>
	<li>persistent dizziness or fainting</li>
	<li>paleness and floppiness (in young children)</li>
	<li>diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting after an insect sting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction and needs urgent medical attention. If your child is having an anaphylactic reaction, first lay her flat. Don’t let her stand or walk around. Next use an adrenaline auto-injector like EpiPen® if one is available. Then call an ambulance.</p>

<h2>Testing for allergies</h2>

<p>The usual tests for detecting an allergy for specific cause include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Skin-prick test:</strong> your child’s skin is pricked with a special device that looks a bit like a toothpick and that contains a drop of a specific allergen. If a hive comes up where your child’s skin has been pricked, your child probably has an allergy.</li>
	<li> <strong>Blood tests:</strong> aim to find out if your child blood contain specific IgE antibody directed against certain allergens (such as pollens, huose dust mite etc). If your child’s blood has a high amount of antibodies, he probably has an allergy. Your child might have this test if he can’t have skin-prick testing..</li>
</ul>

<p>You might hear about tests like IgG food antibody testing, Vega testing and hair analysis. These tests haven’t been scientifically proven as allergy tests.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Treatment for mild to moderate allergic reactions</h2>

<p> Giving your child a dose of <strong>antihistamine</strong> (in tablet or syrup form) is appropriate if your child is having a mild to moderate allergic reaction, including a skin rash, tingling mouth or swelling.</p>

<p>In fact, having some antihistamine syrup in your home first aid kit or in your bag is a good idea – this way it’s handy when you need it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Other treatments for allergies</strong></p>

<p> Depending on the kind of allergic reaction your child has, she might need other treatments. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li> In some cases your dctor might also prescrive corticosteroids to treat allergic reaction.</li>
	<li>If your child has eczema, he might need corticosteroid ointments.</li>
	<li>If your child has hay fever, she might need corticosteroid nose sprays.</li>
	<li>If your child has asthma, he might need an inhaler like Ventolin (salbutamol) or Bricalin (terbutaline).</li>
</ul>

<p>Children who have persistent and troublesome allergies to insect stings, house dust mites and grass pollen might have immunotherapy to reduce their symptoms.</p>

<h2>Treatment for anaphylaxis</h2>

<p>Children at significant risk of anaphylaxis are often prescribed <strong>adrenaline auto-injectors</strong> – for example, EpiPen®.</p>

<p>If your child is prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector, it’s important that both you and your child learn how and when to use it. Your child’s adrenaline auto-injector should be easy to reach at all times. You can also teach others – family, friends, teachers and carers – how to use it.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea for your child to wear a medical bracelet to let other people know about his particular allergy.</p>

1046,Tired signs in babies and toddlers,"When you see tired signs, it’s time to reduce stimulation and settle your child for sleep. Newborn tired signs include pulling at ears, jerking arms and legs, and sucking fingers. Babies and toddlers show they’re tired by grizzling, demanding attention and not wanting to play.","<h2>Tired signs: why they’re important</h2>

<p>Children show they’re tired through changes in behaviour. For example, your child might be suddenly irritable, overactive or demanding.</p>

<p>It’s important to <strong>look for your child’s ‘tired signs’</strong>. These signs let you know when it’s time to reduce stimulation and start settling your child for sleep. If you wait until your child is overtired, it’ll be harder to settle her.</p>

<h2>Newborns: tired signs</h2>

<p>Newborn babies will probably get tired if they’ve been awake for 1-1½ hours.</p>

<p>If your newborn is tired, you might see some of the following tired signs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>pulling at ears</li>
	<li>closing fists</li>
	<li>yawning</li>
	<li>fluttering eyelids or difficulty focusing – your baby might even go cross-eyed or seem to be staring into space</li>
	<li>making jerky arm and leg movements, or arching backwards</li>
	<li>frowning or looking worried</li>
	<li>sucking on fingers – this could be a good sign and might mean that your baby is trying to find ways to settle to sleep.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Babies and toddlers: tired signs</h2>

<p>At <strong>3-6 months</strong>, your baby might be tired after 1½-3 hours awake.</p>

<p>At <strong>6-12 months</strong>, your baby might be tired after 2-3 hours awake.</p>

<p>At <strong>12-18 months</strong>, your baby might be overtired if he misses out on his morning or afternoon sleep.</p>

<p>If your baby or toddler is tired, you might see some of the following tired signs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>clumsiness</li>
	<li>clinginess</li>
	<li>grizzling or crying</li>
	<li>demands for attention</li>
	<li>boredom with toys</li>
	<li>fussiness with food.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tired or hungry?</h2>

<p>Grizzling and crying can mean your child is tired, but it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between tired grizzling and hungry grizzling.</p>

<p>If your baby has had a feed within the last two hours and is grizzling and cranky, she’s probably tired. If you’re not sure, offer a feed. If she takes only a little milk and is still grizzly, she needs a sleep.</p>

<h2>Reducing stimulation</h2>

<p>If your child is showing signs of tiredness, it’s a good idea to get him ready for sleep by reducing stimulation. You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>taking your child to the place where he usually sleeps</li>
	<li>putting toys away</li>
	<li>talking quietly and soothingly</li>
	<li>closing curtains and blinds</li>
	<li>turning overhead lights off – use lamps if you need to</li>
	<li>playing music quietly – this will help cut down on background noise.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making quiet time</h2>

<p>Some quiet time before bed in the place where your child usually sleeps will help her settle to sleep.</p>

<p>Quiet time with your child might include a gentle cuddle, a story or a quiet song.</p>

<p>Your child might need only a few minutes of quiet time before he’s relaxed and ready to be put in bed. If your household is noisy and active, your child might need some extra quiet time before it’s time for sleep.</p>

1056,Co-sleeping with your baby,"The safest place for babies to sleep is in a cot next to a parent’s bed. Co-sleeping is when parents bring their babies into bed with them. Co-sleeping can be dangerous for babies. If you choose to co-sleep, there are things you can do to minimise the risk.","<h2>Sleep environments: what is safest for babies?</h2>

<p>It’s safest for your baby to share a room with you, sleeping in a cot next to your bed, for the first year of life or at least for the first six months.</p>

<h2>Co-sleeping: things to think about</h2>

<p>Co-sleeping is when parents bring their babies into bed with them to sleep.</p>

<p>Co-sleeping is associated with an <strong>increased risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)</strong> including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and fatal sleeping accidents in some circumstances. But parents choose to have their babies in bed with them for several reasons.</p>

<p>For example, some parents who co-sleep with their babies believe that it helps their babies feel safe and secure. They like the close body contact, feel that it’s rewarding and satisfying, and believe it’s good for their relationships with their babies.</p>

<p>Also, some parents co-sleep because they find it more practical. Breastfeeding and resettling during the night can be easier. Some parents feel that it helps with establishing breastfeeding.</p>

<h2>Factors that increase co-sleeping risks</h2>

<p><strong>Co-sleeping always increases the risk of SUDI</strong>. Co-sleeping increases this risk even more if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you’re very tired or you’re unwell</li>
	<li>you or your partner uses drugs, alcohol or any type of sedative medication that causes heavy sleep</li>
	<li>you or your partner is a smoker</li>
	<li>your baby is unwell</li>
	<li>your baby is less than three months old, or was premature or smaller than most babies at birth.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sleeping with a baby on a couch or chair is always unsafe. Move your baby to a safe sleep environment if you think you might fall asleep in a chair or couch while holding your baby.</p>

<h2>Reducing the risk of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents</h2>

<p>Please  check out our guide to reducing the risk of SUDI including SIDS and fatal sleeping accidents.</p>

<p>  Again, we strongly recommend for your baby to share a room with you, sleeping in a cot next to your bed. However, if for some reason your baby co-sleep with you, here is summary of some of the things that can you can do to reduce the risk of SUDI.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>Put your baby on their back to sleep (never on their tummy or side).</li>
	<li>Make sure the mattress is clean and firm. Don’t use a waterbed, or anything soft underneath.</li>
	<li>Keep pillows and adult bedding away from your baby. Make sure your bedding can’t cover your baby’s face. Consider using a safe infant sleeping bag so your baby doesn’t share adult bedding.</li>
	<li>Use lightweight blankets.</li>
	<li>Never wrap or swaddle your baby if you’re co-sleeping.</li>
	<li>Tie up long hair and remove anything else that could be a strangling risk, including all jewelry and teething necklaces.</li>
	<li>Move the bed away from the wall, so baby can’t get trapped between the bed and wall.</li>
	<li>Make sure your baby can’t fall out of bed. The safest spot is on the side of a big bed, away from the edge. Consider sleeping on your mattress on the floor if it’s possible your baby might roll off the bed.</li>
	<li>Place your baby to the side of one parent, never in the middle of two adults or next to other children or pets. Your baby might get rolled on or overheat.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Settling and other problems associated with co-sleeping</h2>

<p>Parents sometimes bring a baby into bed because the baby is <strong>waking or is unsettled at night</strong>. For some families, this works well. For others, it might work in the short term but can lead to problems with settling the baby later on. Also, the parents’ bed might not be safely set up for the baby.</p>

<p>Co-sleeping might be a problem if there’s a <strong>lack of agreement</strong> or tension between partners about co-sleeping.</p>

<p>Finally, a problem could come up if <strong>parents want their child to sleep in a separate bed before the child wants to move</strong>. Many parents who sleep with their children report that children usually want their own beds by the age of 2-3 years. It can take longer than this, though, and sometimes parents want to stop co-sleeping before their child does.</p>

<p>If you’re experiencing any of these problems, co-sleeping might not be a good option for you and your child. There are other options for settling your baby to sleep.</p>",1686,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"1636, 1641, 1646",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/sleep/where-your-baby-sleeps/co-sleeping"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/sleep/where-your-baby-sleeps/co-sleeping</a></p>",en,published
1061,The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU): what to expect,NICUs have highly trained medical and nursing staff and special equipment to care for premature babies and sick newborns. Each baby is closely monitored by an individual bedside nurse and other specialists. Most hospitals are family friendly and aim to involve parents.,"<h2>What a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is</h2>

<p>A neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a hospital intensive care unit that specialises in looking after premature and sick newborn babies.</p>

<p>NICUs have specialist doctors, nurses, other professionals and equipment to care for premature and sick babies.</p>

<h2>What the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) looks like</h2>

<p>The first time you go into a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), it can feel overwhelming.</p>

<p>You need to wash your hands with sterilising soap for several minutes before you go in. Babies in NICUs can very easily catch infections, and proper hand-cleaning cuts the risk of this happening.</p>

<p>The NICU might have quiet periods when the <strong>lights are</strong> <strong>dimmed and it’s quiet</strong>. Often, babies in the NICU can be overwhelmed by too much noise and light.</p>

<p>Most babies will have either a <strong>heated open cot or a covered incubator</strong>. These keep their bodies at the right temperature.</p>

<p>Depending on what medical support the babies need, there might be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ventilators to help with breathing</li>
	<li>machines to give measured amounts of fluids and medicines to the babies through tubes going into their veins</li>
	<li>monitors attached to the babies with cords to measure heart rate, breathing and the amount of oxygen in their blood</li>
</ul>

<p>The NICU is <strong>usually a calm place</strong>, with nurses and doctors quietly looking after the babies and other specialists coming in and out. Monitors will sound to alert the staff if a baby’s breathing or heart rate is out of the normal range.</p>

<h2>Your family and the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)</h2>

<p>Hospitals try to make the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) family friendly. Different hospitals will do things a bit differently, but your hospital will have a policy to make sure that your family is looked after while your baby is in the NICU. You can ask for a copy of the hospital’s policy.</p>

<p>Family-centred care in the NICU is becoming the ‘gold standard’ of care. It’s about treating you and your family with respect and working as a team with you to make decisions about your baby’s care and treatment in the NICU.</p>",2231,2,"43,44",59,60,"1651, 1656, 1661, 1666, 441",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/neonatal-intensive-care/nicu-what-to-expect"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/neonatal-intensive-care/nicu-what-to-expect</a></p>",en,published

<p><strong>1. Make the space around your baby more personal</strong><br />
You can bring things from home, use people’s gifts, or put up photos of yourselves and your baby’s siblings to make the space around your baby different from that of other babies. But keep in mind that too much clutter can make caring for your baby difficult.</p>

<p><strong>2. Create a private space</strong><br />
Sitting in the NICU, you’re usually facing outwards. That means everyone who goes by can see you. If you want some private time but also want to stay beside your baby, turn your chair around so that you face inwards. </p>

<p><strong>3. Celebrate special occasions</strong><br />
 Celebrating a special day can take your mind off your worries about your baby.</p>

<h2>Visiting your baby in the NICU</h2>

<p><strong>4. Ask questions and keep informed</strong><br />
The NICU can be overwhelming. If there’s anything you’re unsure of, it’s OK to ask hospital staff to explain in words you understand. You can take notes to help you remember important details.</p>

<p>Building relationships with medical staff can make it easier for you to ask questions and stay up to date. You could choose to speak regularly with two or three medical staff about how your baby is going. Ward rounds can be a good time to do this.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get involved with your baby’s routines</strong><br />
If you can, plan to be in the NICU when the staff do your baby’s ‘cares’. You can first learn and then gradually take over your baby’s care. For example, you can help wash your baby’s face, change nappies or reposition your baby.</p>

<p>By doing this, you become a part of your baby’s life. He’ll learn to recognise you, and you’ll learn how to handle your baby in the ways he likes best. This is a great way to gain confidence in caring for him.</p>

<p><strong>6. Have friends and family visit to support you</strong><br />
Some, but not all, NICUs allow friends and extended family to visit. Most of all, these visitors  support you while you’re supporting your child.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to have only one or two visitors at a time, because too many people can be overwhelming for you and your baby.</p>

<p><strong>7. Keep a record of your baby’s development</strong><br />
It’s likely that you’ll forget many things about this time in your baby’s life – even though it might seem unforgettable now. You could take photos or videos, or keep a diary to help you remember.</p>

<h2>Relaxing and unwinding in and out of the NICU</h2>

<p><strong>8. Go out of the hospital for short breaks</strong><br />
Spending long hours in the NICU can be boring and tiring. Share the care with your partner and take turns getting out of the hospital for a break. </p>

<p><strong>9. Find somewhere quiet to rest</strong><br />
 </p>

<p><strong>10. Consider to write a journal</strong><br />
Writing a journal can give you a chance to express feelings, reflect on what’s happening. The journal might be for your eyes only, or you might plan to share it with others at some later stage.</p>

<p><strong>11. Take a book to read</strong><br />
 </p>

<p><strong>12. Do relaxation exercises</strong><br />
 </p>

<p><strong>13. Allow yourself time for treats</strong><br />
 Going out with your partner, on your own or with friends is good for everyone.</p>

<h2>Looking after yourself while your baby is in the NICU</h2>

<p><strong>14. Go easy on yourself</strong><br />
It’s OK to say that you can’t make it to a friend’s birthday party this year if you don’t feel up to it. If you look after yourself, you’ll be better able to better look after your baby.</p>

<p><strong>15. Accept help from family and friends</strong><br />
Practical help from friends and family can free you up for these priorities. </p>

<p><strong>16. Talk to someone</strong><br />
Having a baby in NICU can be difficult and it’s normal to feel strong emotions like guilt, anger, shame and hopelessness. It’s good to acknowledge your emotions and talk to someone you trust about how you’re feeling. </p>

<p><strong>17. Eat well</strong><br />
Nutritious food will boost your energy levels.Use your hunger, thirst and fullness to guide what you eat and drink.</p>

<p><strong>18. Accept that there’ll be ups and downs</strong><br />
Knowing and accepting that there will be good days and bad days will help you to not feel so shocked and worried when bad days happen.</p>

1076,Baby bath time,"Now that your baby is a bit older, she’s probably enjoying baths more. Read practical tips for making baby bath time safe and fun.","<h2>Baby bath time: how often?</h2>

<p>A bath <strong>2-3 times a week</strong> is enough to keep your baby clean. But if your baby really likes baths, you can bath him once a day. Bathing more than this can dry out your baby’s skin.</p>

<p>You can keep your baby’s genitals clean between baths by using warm water and cotton wool.</p>

<p><strong>About 5-10 minutes is long enough</strong> for a baby bath. This is especially important if your baby has dry or sensitive skin.</p>

<h2>When to give your baby a bath</h2>

<p>You can bath your baby at any time of the day. It’s a good idea to pick a time when you’re relaxed and you won’t be interrupted. And it’s best to avoid bathing your baby when he’s hungry or straight after a feed.</p>

<p>If your baby likes a bath and it seems to relax her, you can use bathing as a way to help settle her in the evening. Some babies sleep longer after an evening bath.</p>

<h2>Where to bath your baby</h2>

<p>By now, your baby might be too big for a plastic baby bath. This means it’s probably time to make the change to the <strong>big bath.</strong> You can help make the transition easier by putting the small baby bath into the big bath a few times.</p>

<p>Once your baby is ready for the big bath, you might like to <strong>take a bath with him </strong>(while keeping safe and having an extra person around to help).</p>

<p>You can also shower with your baby. Keep your baby’s face away from the pouring water and make sure the water isn’t too hot.</p>

<p>A big bath allows more room for games and toys. But your baby doesn’t need lots of toys in the bath, and toys can be very simple.</p>

<h2>Setting up a baby bath safely: tips</h2>

<p><strong>Drowning and scalds are the two main risks</strong> with bath time. With these simple tips, you can avoid these risks and keep bath time fun and safe for your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take the phone off the hook or turn your phone off while bathing your baby. You’ll be less likely to get distracted.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have everything you need at hand – for example, towel, washcloth, bath toys, lotion or shampoo, clean clothes and clean nappy. This way you can keep your eyes and hands on your baby at all times.</li>
	<li>Make sure all bath lotions, shampoos and electrical appliances are out of baby’s reach.</li>
	<li>Check the water temperature is around 37-38°C before you put your baby in.</li>
	<li>Place your baby in a safe area like a cot when you take him out of the bath.</li>
	<li>Empty the bath as soon as you’re finished with it. Remove bath plugs from the bath when they’re not in use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children can drown in a few seconds in very shallow water. Never leave your baby alone in the bath, even if you’re using a bath seat or cradle. Never leave older children or siblings to supervise. If you’re disturbed by the phone or another task, take your baby out of the bath.</p>

<h2>Baby bath time: step by step</h2>

<p>Although your baby is older now, it’s still a good idea to keep soap, shampoos and bubble baths to a minimum – they can irritate skin and cause nappy rash.</p>

<p>Your baby will probably try to pull herself up or stand up in the bath. If you can’t stop her trying this, at least make sure you’re holding her so she can’t slip. You might like to use a non-slip bathmat and have a non-slip surface in your bath.</p>",2496,2,"45,46,47",59,60,"1341, 1346, 1351, 1356",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/hygiene-keeping-clean/baby-bath-time"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/health-daily-care/hygiene-keeping-clean/baby-bath-time</a></p>",en,published
1081,Middle ear infection,"Middle ear infection symptoms include pain and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Take your child to the GP if you think she has a middle ear infection.Symptoms usually improve within 24-48 hours. Paracetamol, ibuprofen or eardrops can help with pain. Don’t clean your child’s ear with cotton wool or a cotton bud.","<h2>About middle ear infection or otitis media</h2>

<p>A middle ear infection is an infection in the fluid behind the eardrum.</p>

<p>The infection can be caused by either a bacteria or a virus.</p>

<p>Middle ear infections are <strong>very common</strong> in young children. </p>

<p>The medical name for middle ear infections is otitis media<em>.</em></p>

<p>The ear has three main parts – the outer ear (the ear canal and ear lobe), the middle ear (behind the eardrum, and linked to the throat), and the inner ear (which has the nerves that help to detect sound).</p>

<h2>Symptoms of middle ear infection</h2>

<p>Most children with a middle ear infection complain of earache. They might feel off balance and have trouble hearing. Symptoms can also include fever, runny nose, irritability or loss of appetite.</p>

<p>Babies might cry a lot and pull at the affected ear, especially at night when lying down. </p>

<p>Occasionally the eardrum might rupture. This is called a<strong> perforated eardrum</strong>. There might be a thick and sometimes bloody discharge from your child’s ear. This helps to relieve the pressure that has built up in the ear from the infection, and eases the pain. The burst eardrum usually heals naturally.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about a middle ear infection?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should take your child to see your doctot if:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>your child complains of a disturbibg earache</li>
	<li>your child has discharge of pus from his ear</li>
	<li>your child is generally unwell, has a fever or is vomiting</li>
	<li>you think your child is having trouble hearing</li>
	<li>your child keeps getting ear infections</li>
	<li>your child has swelling behind the ear or the ear is pushed forward.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for middle ear infection</h2>

<p>The doctor will check your child’s ear with an otoscope.</p>

<p>If your child has had several ear infections, or if your doctor thinks there might be a chronic infection, the doctor might organise a <strong>hearing test</strong>. </p>

<h2>Treatment for middle ear infection</h2>

<p>Symptoms of middle ear infection <strong>usually improve by themselves within 24-48 hours</strong>, so antibiotics aren’t often needed.</p>

<p>You can give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses to help with pain. Your doctor might suggest some anaesthetic ear drops if your child has severe pain.</p>

<p>If your child still has pain and is unwell after 48 hours, is particularly unwell, especially if she is less than 12 months old, your doctor might prescribe a short course of <strong>antibiotics</strong>, usually amoxycillin.</p>

<p>Most children improve after a few days of antibiotic treatment, but always make sure your child finishes the whole treatment. Stopping too soon could make the infection come back. </p>

<p>Decongestants, antihistamines and corticosteroids don’t work as a treatment for middle ear infections.</p>

<p>Putting cotton wool in your child’s ear or <strong>cleaning discharge with a cotton bud can damage the ear</strong>. It isn’t recommended.</p>

<h2>Prevention of middle ear infection</h2>

<p>Many children who get recurrent ear infections have <strong>grommets</strong> put into their eardrums to prevent infection. Grommets are special ventilating tubes that stop fluid from building up behind the eardrum and help preserve hearing. If your child needs grommets, he’ll see an ear, nose and throat specialist.</p>

<p>Avoid smoking. Children who are exposed to second-hand smoke are more likely to develop a range of illnesses, including middle ear infections.</p>",8986,2,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1681, 1686, 1691",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/middle-ear-infection"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/middle-ear-infection</a></p>",en,published
1086,Food intolerances in children,"Food intolerance isn’t the same as food allergy. Food intolerance symptoms include bloating, diarrhoea and stomach pain. Food intolerance symptoms usually clear up by themselves. Common food intolerances include lactose, wheat, additives and fructose.","<h2>About food intolerance</h2>

<p>A food intolerance is a reaction to the food you’re eating. The reaction might be because your body can’t properly break down the food. Or it might be because your body is irritated by a chemical that’s found in the food.</p>

<p>Some people can cope with small amounts of foods they’re intolerant of.</p>

<p>Food intolerances aren’t the same as food allergies. Food allergies happen when your immune system reacts to a food you’ve eaten. Food intolerances don’t involve your immune system. Food allergies are generally more severe and have more symptoms than food intolerances</p>

<h2>Symptoms of food intolerance</h2>

<p>Symptoms of food intolerance include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>bloating</li>
	<li>diarrhoea</li>
	<li>stomach pain</li>
	<li>headaches</li>
	<li>mouth ulcers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Food intolerance symptoms are <strong>often delayed</strong> and can appear up to two days after you’ve eaten the food you’re intolerant of.</p>

<p>If you think your child has food intolerance or you’re not sure why your child is having symptoms, it’s best to talk with your doctor.</p>

<h2>Common food intolerances</h2>

<p>The most common food intolerances are to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>lactose, which is the sugar in dairy products</li>
	<li>wheat</li>
	<li>food additives, including flavour enhancers like MSG</li>
	<li>fructose, which is the sugar in fruit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosing food intolerance</h2>

<p><strong>Elimination diets</strong> are the most common test for food intolerance. This involves removing from your child’s diet foods that might cause intolerance. You remove the food for a period of time, usually weeks. Then you reintroduce foods one at a time to work out which food is causing the intolerance.</p>

<p>For suspected fructose or lactose intolerance, doctors might also use a <strong>breath test</strong>. This tests the amount of hydrogen gas in the child’s breath. Lactose-intolerant children will have higher levels of hydrogen in their breath.</p>

<p>Diagnosing lactose intolerance can sometimes be tricky because symptoms can look similar to food allergy.</p>

<h2>What to do about food intolerance</h2>

<p>If a doctor has diagnosed food intolerance in your child, the doctor might recommend that your child eats smaller amounts of the food causing the intolerance, or that your child avoids the food altogether.</p>

<p>If your child eats something you know he’s intolerant of and gets symptoms of intolerance, the <strong>symptoms will usually clear up by themselves</strong>. Your child shouldn’t need urgent medical attention.</p>

<p>If your child’s symptoms include diarrhoea, you need to make sure she gets plenty of water.</p>

<h2>How long do food intolerances last?</h2>

<p>We don’t know much about how likely children are to grow out of food intolerances. How long a food intolerance lasts depends on the food and the reason your child’s body is reacting to it.</p>

<p>If you think your child has grown out of a food intolerance, it’s best to speak with your doctor or dietitian. They might suggest you carefully introduce the food into your child’s diet at home to check whether the food intolerance has gone.</p>",2546,2,"50,51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/food-intolerances"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/food-intolerances</a></p>",en,published
1096,Baby sleep: 2-12 months,"Most babies under six months of age still need feeding and help to settle in the night. As babies get older, they need less sleep. More of their sleep happens at night. Other developments, like crawling and separation anxiety, can affect sleep and settling for babies over six months.","<h2>How baby sleep changes from 2 to 12 months</h2>

<p>As they get older, babies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>sleep less in the daytime</li>
	<li>are awake for longer between naps</li>
	<li>have longer night-time sleeps and wake less at night</li>
	<li>need less sleep overall.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2-3 months: what to expect from baby sleep</h2>

<p>At this age, babies sleep on and off during the day and night. They sleep for <strong> around 16 hours </strong>in every 24 hours.</p>

<p>Babies sleep in <strong>cycles that last about 40 minutes</strong>. . Babies move around and grunt during active sleep, and sleep deeply during quiet sleep.</p>

<p>Around 2-3 months, babies <strong>start developing night and day sleep patterns</strong>. This means they tend to start sleeping more during the night.</p>

<h2>Around 3 months: what to expect from baby sleep</h2>

<p>Around three months, babies’ sleep changes to longer cycles of light sleep, deep sleep and dream sleep. These changes might mean less waking and resettling during sleep.</p>

<p>At this age, babies might regularly be having longer sleeps at night – for example, around 4-5 hours.</p>

<p>Babies still need <strong>around 16 hours sleep</strong> in every 24 hours.</p>

<h2>3-6 months: what to expect from baby sleep</h2>

<p>At this age, babies need <strong>14-16 hours</strong> of sleep every 24 hours.</p>

<p>Babies might start moving towards a pattern of 2-3 daytime sleeps of up to two hours each.</p>

<p>And night-time sleeps get longer at this age. For example, babies <strong>might be having long sleeps of six hours at night</strong> by the time they’re six months old.</p>

<p>But you can expect that your baby will still wake at least once each night.</p>

<h2>6-12 months: what to expect from baby sleep</h2>

<p>Babies sleep less as they get older. By the time your baby is one year old, baby will probably need <strong>12-16 hours</strong> sleep every 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep during the night</strong><br />
From about six months, most babies have their longest sleeps at night.</p>

<p>Most babies are ready for bed between 6 pm and 8 pm. They usually take less than 30 minutes to get to sleep, but about 1 in 10 babies takes longer.</p>

<p>At this age, baby sleep cycles are closer to those of grown-up sleep – which means less waking at night. So your baby might not wake you during the night, or waking might happen less often.</p>

<p>By <strong>eight months</strong>, most babies can settle themselves back to sleep without a parent’s help. Others keep waking if they need help to settle back to sleep, or if they’re still having breastfeeds or bottles during the night.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep during the day</strong><br />
At this age, most babies are still having 1-2 daytime naps. These naps usually last 1-2 hours. Some babies sleep longer, but up to a quarter of babies nap for less than an hour.</p>

<h2>How baby sleep patterns affect grown-ups</h2>

<p>Most parents of babies under six months of age are still getting up in the night to feed and settle their babies. For many this keeps going after six months.</p>

<p>Some parents find that this is OK as long as they have enough support and they can catch up on sleep at other times. For others, getting up in the night over the long term has a serious effect on them and their family lives.</p>

<p><strong>The quality of your sleep can affect your health and your mood.</strong> Being exhausted can make it hard to give your baby positive attention during the day. And your relationship with your baby and the time and attention you give baby during the day can affect the quality and quantity of baby’s sleep.</p>

<p>It’s a cycle that isn’t good for you or your baby – so it’s worth doing something about it.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned about your baby’s sleep, there are strategies you can use to change your baby’s sleep patterns. If you’ve tried these strategies and things haven’t improved, or the difficulties are starting to upset you, seek professional help for baby sleep.

1101,Toddler teeth issues,"Common toddler teeth issues include teething, sucking thumbs and grinding teeth. These issues are a typical part of toddler development. If you’re concerned about your toddler’s teeth, see your dentist.","<h2>Teething in toddlers</h2>

<p>Many people think that ‘teething’ children:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>cry a lot or seem extra cranky</li>
	<li>don’t feed as well as usual</li>
	<li>suck on objects like toys, dummies and bibs</li>
	<li>have more dirty nappies</li>
	<li>pull the ear on the same side as the tooth coming through.</li>
</ul>

<p>These signs might be caused by teething – or they might just be part of development or a result of minor infections and illnesses.</p>

<h2>Teething: things to try</h2>

<p>If you’re concerned about your child’s teething, you can try:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>giving your child something to bite on, like a cold but not frozen teething ring, toothbrush or dummy</li>
	<li>cooking mushier foods, which need less chewing</li>
	<li>giving your child something firm, like a sugar-free rusk, to suck on.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teething gels aren’t usually recommended</strong> because they probably don’t help ease pain. They can also have harmful side effects.</p>

<p>If your child isn’t well, it’s always best to take her to the doctor  – especially if she has a fever or diarrhoea or you’re worried about any other symptoms. Teething might not be the problem.</p>

<h2>Dummies, thumb-sucking and teeth-grinding </h2>

<p>Many toddlers still love their dummies. But it might be a good idea to encourage your child to let go of the dummy at this stage.</p>

<p><strong>Sucking thumbs or fingers</strong> is a natural reflex in babies and young children. Most children grow out of thumb-sucking and finger-sucking around 2-4 years of age.</p>

<p>It’s pretty <strong>common for toddlers to grind their teeth</strong>, and this issue doesn’t usually need treatment. Some children clench their jaws quite firmly, and others grind their teeth so hard that it makes a noise. Some children grind their teeth during sleep. Often, they don’t wake up when they do it – but other people do!</p>

<p>Most of the time, teeth-grinding doesn’t last and doesn’t damage your child’s teeth. But it could lead to your child having headaches and tooth or jaw pain, or wearing down his teeth. If it keeps going or you’re concerned, you might want to talk to your dentist.</p>

1106,Toilet training: a practical guide,"Helping your child learn to use the potty or toilet is a big and very exciting step for you both. If you stay positive and calm, your child will be more likely to settle into things. The secret is to wait for signs that your child is ready for toilet training.","<h2>Toilet training: signs that your child is ready</h2>

<p>You might see signs that your child is ready for toilet training from about <strong>two years on</strong>. Some children show signs of being ready as early as 18 months, and some might be older than two years.</p>

<p>Your child is showing<strong> signs of being ready</strong> if they:</p>

<ul>
	<li>are walking and can sit for short periods of time</li>
	<li>are becoming generally more independent when it comes to completing tasks, including saying ‘no’ more often</li>
	<li>are becoming interested in watching others go to the toilet – this can make you uncomfortable, but it’s a good way to introduce things</li>
	<li>have dry nappies for up to two hours – this shows they can store urine in their bladder (which automatically empties in younger babies or newborns)</li>
	<li>tell you with words or gestures when they do a poo or pee in their nappy – if they can tell you before it happens, they’re ready for toilet training</li>
	<li>begin to dislike wearing a nappy, perhaps trying to pull it off when it’s wet or soiled</li>
	<li>have regular, soft, formed bowel movements</li>
	<li>can pull their pants up and down</li>
	<li>can follow simple instructions like ‘Give the ball to daddy’</li>
	<li>show understanding about things having their place around the home.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not all these signs need to be present</strong> when your child is ready. A general trend will let you know it’s time to start.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about toilet training, you might like to check out our toilet training guide in pictures. You could even print it out and stick it up somewhere handy.</p>

<h2>Getting ready for toilet training</h2>

<p>If you think your child is showing signs of being ready for toilet training, the first step is to decide whether you want to train using a <strong>potty or the toilet</strong>.</p>

<p>There are some advantages to using a potty – it’s mobile and it’s familiar, and some children find it less scary than a toilet. Try to find out your child’s preference and go with that. Some parents encourage their child to use both the toilet and potty.</p>

<p>Second, make sure you have all the right <strong>equipment</strong>. For example, if your child is using the toilet you’ll need a step for your child to stand on. You’ll also need a smaller seat that fits securely inside the existing toilet seat, because some children get uneasy about falling in.</p>

<p>Third, it’s best to <strong>plan toilet training for a time when you don’t have any big changes</strong> coming up in your family life. Changes might include going on holiday, starting day care, having a new baby or moving house. It can be a good idea to plan toilet training for well before or after these changes.</p>

<p>Also, toilet training might go better if you and your child have a regular daily routine. This way, the new activity of using the toilet or potty can be slotted into your normal routine.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>tips for getting ready</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Teach your child some words for going to the toilet – for example, ‘pee’, ‘poo’ and ‘I need to go’.</li>
	<li>When you change your child’s nappy, put wet and dirty nappies in the potty – this can help your child understand what the potty is for.</li>
	<li>Let your child try sitting on the potty or the small toilet seat to get familiar with the new equipment.</li>
	<li>Let your child watch you or other trusted family members using the toilet, and talk about what you’re doing.</li>
	<li>Once or twice a day you might want to start putting trainer pants on your child. This helps your child understand the feeling of wetness.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child is eating plenty of fibre and drinking lots of water so your child doesn’t get constipated. Constipation can make toilet training harder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you start, toilet training might take days, weeks or months. The key is to not push your child, and let your child learn at their own pace. Your child will get the hang of it in time. And if your child doesn’t cooperate or seem interested in toilet training right now, just wait until they want to try again.</p>

<h2>Starting toilet training</h2>

<p>It’s a good idea to <strong>start toilet training on a day when you have no plans to leave the house</strong>. The tips below can help with toilet training once the big day arrives.</p>

<p><strong>Timing</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sit your child on the potty at times when poos often happen, like 30 minutes after eating or after having a bath. This doesn’t work for all children – true toilet training begins when your child is aware of doing a poo or peeing and is interested in learning the process.</li>
	<li>Look out for signs that your child needs to go to the toilet. Cues include changes in posture, passing wind, going quiet or moving to a different room by themselves.</li>
	<li>If your child doesn’t pee or do a poo after 3-5 minutes of sitting on the potty or toilet, take your child off. It’s best not to make your child sit on the toilet for long periods of time, because this will feel like punishment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Encouraging and reminding your child</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Praise your child for trying (even if progress is slow), especially when they’re successful. You could say, ‘Well done for sitting on the potty’. This lets your child know they’re doing a good job. Gradually reduce the amount of praise as your child masters each part of the process.</li>
	<li>At different stages throughout the day (but not too often), ask your child if they need to go to the toilet. Gentle reminders are enough – it’s best if your child doesn’t feel pressured.</li>
	<li>If your child misses the toilet, try not to get frustrated. Children don’t usually have accidents on purpose, so just clean up without any comments or fuss.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pants and clothing</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stop using nappies (except at night and during daytime sleeps). Start using underpants or training pants all the time. You can even let your child choose some underpants, which can be an exciting step.</li>
	<li>Dress your child in clothes that are easy to take off – for example, trousers with elastic waistbands, rather than full body suits. In warmer weather, you might like to leave your child in underpants when you’re at home.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hygiene</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Wipe your child’s bottom until your child learns how. Remember to wipe from the front to the back, particularly with girls.</li>
	<li>Teach your son to shake his penis after peeing to get rid of any drops. Early in toilet training it sometimes helps to float a ping pong ball in the toilet for your son to aim at. Or he might prefer to sit to pee, which can be less messy.</li>
	<li>Teach your child how to wash hands after using the toilet. This can be a fun activity that your child enjoys as part of the routine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, children are 3-4 years old before they’re dry at night. One in 5 five-year-olds and 1 in 10 six-year-olds still uses nappies overnight. And bedwetting is very common in school-age children. If your child wets the bed, there are things you can do about it when you and your child are ready.</p>

<h2>Out and about while toilet training</h2>

<p>It’s easier to stay home for a few days when you start toilet training, but you’ll probably have to go out at some stage.</p>

<p>Wherever you’re going, it’s a good idea to check where the nearest toilet is. If you’re going to a local shopping centre, ask your child if they need to go when you get there. This can help get your child familiar with the new area.</p>

<p>It’s best to take a spare change of underpants and clothes for your child when you’re out, until your child is very confident about using the toilet. It’s also a good idea to carry plastic bags for wet or soiled clothes.</p>

<p>If your child goes to a child care service or to friends’ or relatives’ houses without you, let people know that your child is toilet training. This way they can help your child use the toilet or potty in the way that you do at home.</p>

<h2>Setbacks and accidents while toilet training</h2>

<p>Learning to pee and do poos in the toilet takes time. You can expect accidents and setbacks – these are all just part of the process.</p>

<p>If your child gets upset because of an accident, reassure your child that it doesn’t matter and there’s no need to worry.</p>

<p>Here are <strong>ideas to help avoid accidents</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pay attention if your child says they need the toilet straight away. They might be right!</li>
	<li>If you’re sure your child hasn’t done a poo or peed in a while, remind your child that they might need to go. Your child might be so caught up in what they’re doing that they don’t realise they need to go until it’s too late.</li>
	<li>Check if your child wants to go to the toilet during a long playtime or before an outing. If they don’t want to go, that’s fine.</li>
	<li>Try to make sure the potty or toilet is always easy to get to and use.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to pee just before going to bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to stay calm if toilet training seems to take longer than you expect. Stay positive about your child’s achievements, because your child will get there eventually. Too much tension or stress can lead to negative feelings and might result in your child avoiding going to the toilet.</p>

<h2>Health problems</h2>

<p>It’s worth keeping an eye out for possible problems connected with toilet training. Signs to look for include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a big increase or decrease in the number of stools or pees</li>
	<li>stools that are very hard to pass</li>
	<li>unformed or very watery stools</li>
	<li>blood in the stool or urine (sometimes appears as cloudy urine)</li>
	<li>pain when your child goes to the toilet.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel there might be a problem or you’re worried about how your child is adapting to toilet training, check with your doctor/GP or child and family health nurse.</p>",5366,2,"48,49,50,51,52",59,60,"1806, 1811",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/health-daily-care/toileting/toilet-training-guide"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/health-daily-care/toileting/toilet-training-guide</a></p>",en,published
1116,Toddler sleep: what to expect,Toddlers need about 12-13 hours of sleep every 24 hours. That’s usually 10-12 hours at night and 1-2 hours during the day. Common toddler sleep problems include having trouble settling to sleep and not wanting to stay in bed at bedtime. A consistent bedtime routine helps toddlers get ready for sleep.,"<h2>Toddler sleep: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Once asleep, <strong>most toddlers sleep through most nights</strong> without waking mum or dad. But toddlers love to test their independence, so getting them to bed in the first place can be a challenge.</p>

<p>Young children also get overtired easily. When they do, they find it harder to get to sleep. Once you can spot your child’s signs of tiredness, you’ll be able to settle your child to sleep before grumpiness sets in. A  consistent bedtime routine will be a big help.</p>

<p>Understanding sleep and sleep patterns is an important starting point for helping your child develop healthy habits and a positive attitude towards sleep.</p>

<h2>Toddler sleep schedule</h2>

<p>If the afternoon nap is too long or too late in the day, they might not be ready for bed until late at night.</p>

<p>Some toddlers like to wake at <strong>5.30 am or 6 am</strong>. There isn’t much you can do about this. Putting your toddler to bed later at night in the hope of later waking in the morning doesn’t tend to work. Your toddler might still wake up early then be grumpy from too little sleep.</p>

<p>If you live with an early riser, you might want to make your bedtime earlier too.</p>

<h2>Toddler bedtime routine</h2>

<p>A consistent bedtime routine helps prepare toddlers for sleep.</p>

<p>Most toddlers are ready for bed between 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm. This is a good time, because they sleep deepest between 8 pm and midnight. It’s important to keep the routine consistent on weekends as well as during the week.</p>

<p>A bedtime routine might look something like this:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>6.30 pm</strong>: brush teeth and change nappy</li>
	<li><strong>6.45 pm</strong>: quiet time (read a book or tell a story)</li>
	<li><strong>7 pm</strong>: into bed and kiss goodnight.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before you turn out the light, it’s a good idea to do a quick check of your child’s room to make sure the sleeping environment is safe.</p>

<p>If your child takes a dummy to bed, you might consider encouraging your child to let go of the dummy.</p>

<p>Taking a bottle of milk to bed isn’t a good idea either, because it can cause tooth decay and lead to more problems with sleep. It’s better for your child to finish their milk at least 30 minutes before going to bed.</p>

<h2>Calling out and getting up after bedtime</h2>

<p>Your toddler might go through a stage of calling out or getting out of bed after you’ve said goodnight.</p>

<p>Try these tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid boisterous play before bedtime. This can make it harder for your child to settle.</li>
	<li>Turn off the TV, computers and tablets an hour before bedtime, and avoid letting your child watch scary or exciting things close to bedtime.</li>
	<li>Set up a consistent, calming bedtime routine.</li>
	<li>Before leaving your child’s bedroom, check that your child has everything they need. Remind your child to stay quietly in bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your toddler shares a bedroom with a brother or sister, you might need to delay your other child’s bedtime by half an hour until your toddler is settled and asleep. If you’re firm and consistent, your toddler will quickly get the message that bedtime is for sleeping.</p>

<p>Check whether <strong>your child actually needs something</strong> when they call out. If your child has done a poo, change the nappy with the lights dim and no talking. If your child is scared of a monster under the bed, quickly check (with the light off) to confirm the room is free of monsters. If your child is scared of the dark, think about using a night-light.</p>

<p>Many toddlers have settling and sleep problems. But in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), problems like going to sleep and staying asleep can be more severe. You can manage and overcome many sleep problems in children with ASD using common behaviour strategies.</p>

<h2>Night terrors</h2>

<p>A night terror is when your child suddenly gets very upset while sleeping deeply. Night terrors can be scary for you, but they don’t hurt your child, and your child won’t remember them in the morning.</p>

<p>Lack of sleep can cause night terrors in some children. If you think your child isn’t getting enough sleep, a positive bedtime routine might help.</p>

<p>A night terror usually settles down in 10-15 minutes, but they can last longer than this.</p>

<h2>Moving to a ‘big bed’</h2>

<p>Most children move from a cot to a bed when they’re around 2-3½ years old. But there’s no hurry, particularly because some young toddlers might try to get out of a big bed more often.</p>

<p>You might need to move your child if your child has started climbing out of the cot or needs to use the potty at night, or if you need the cot for a new baby.</p>

<h2>Teeth-grinding</h2>

<p>Many children grind their teeth at some stage. Children won’t usually be woken up by the sound of their own teeth-grinding – but other people in the room might be!</p>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>Sleep medications aren’t usually the solution to children’s sleep problems – there are better ways to deal with these difficulties.</p>

<p>Children’s sleep problems are one of the most common reasons that parents seek help from professionals. Your child’s sleep problems will be much easier to manage with the support of a trusted child health professional.</p>",6176,2,"49,50,51",59,60,"1816, 1821, 1826",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/sleep/understanding-sleep/toddler-sleep"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/sleep/understanding-sleep/toddler-sleep</a></p>",en,published
1121,Children's sleep: 20 frequently asked questions,"Good habits like bedtime routines and getting enough exercise during the day can make it easier for your child to fall asleep. Children’s sleep habits like snoring, night terrors and teeth-grinding are usually harmless, but see your doctor if you’re concerned. Behaviour strategies can help with some sleep problems, like getting out of bed a lot.","<p>You can often handle sleep difficulties by setting up a positive bedtime routine and using our tips to help children sleep better. But you should see your doctor if you’re worried that sleep problems are affecting your child’s wellbeing, schoolwork or relationships. You should also see your GP if you’re worried that your child has a medical condition or illness that’s affecting her sleep.</p>

<h2>My three-year-old twitches as she falls asleep. Is this normal?</h2>

<p>Yes. These twitches are probably ‘sleep starts’ – quick jerks of the arms and legs that happen as your child falls asleep. Up to 70% of children and grown-ups have sleep starts. Tiredness, stress or lack of sleep might make them worse, so it can be worth checking your child’s sleep habits. If the jerks are repetitive rather than just one or two quick movements, or if they happen throughout the night, you should check with your doctor.</p>

<h2>My child snores and gasps at night. Should I be worried?</h2>

<p>Snoring can be caused by a cold or a blocked nose. It’ll usually sort itself out when the cold has gone.</p>

<p>If the snoring doesn’t go away and happens most nights, even when your child is well, it could be a sign of obstructive sleep apnoea that needs apptopriate treatment. Obstructive sleep apnoea causes your child to stop breathing for short periods during sleep. See your doctor if your child continually snores, stops breathing during sleep, works hard to breathe, breathes through her mouth, tosses and turns at night, or sweats a lot overnight. These breathing difficulties can make your child wake up tired and cranky in the morning and can cause damage to the heart.</p>

<h2>Is my child getting enough sleep? How much sleep do different ages need?</h2>

<p>Different children need different amounts of sleep, so it can be hard to know whether your child is getting enough. You can check the recommended amount of sleep for your child’s age in these articles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Toddler sleep</li>
	<li>Preschooler sleep</li>
</ul>

<h2>When should a child stop napping? How long should a nap be?</h2>

<p>Around 25% of children stop napping by three years. Another 50% stop at 3-4 years. Most children have stopped napping by five years if they’re getting enough sleep at night. Naps can range from 30 minutes to around two hours.</p>

<p>If you’re having bedtime struggles, try letting your child have a shorter nap earlier in the day – for example, a nap after lunch. If your child won’t have a daytime nap, try to give him some quiet time resting in his room or encourage him to do something quiet, like reading with you or looking at picture books by himself.</p>

<h2>What does it mean if my child wakes up grumpy?</h2>

<p>The most likely reason for your child waking up grumpy is that she hasn’t had enough sleep. But if she’s sleeping the right amount for her age, waking up grumpy might mean that she isn’t getting good-quality sleep. If your child is snoring or very restless overnight, see your doctor to have her checked for a sleep problem.</p>

<h2>How do I get my child to sleep before midnight?</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas to help your child get to sleep earlier:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Encourage your child to go to bed and get up around the same time every day. This can help get his body clock into a regular rhythm. For example, on weekends a sleep-in of an hour is OK, but it’s best to avoid longer sleep-ins. These might lead to your child not feeling tired at night.</li>
	<li>Discourage late-night eating, and encourage your child to have breakfast when he gets up in the morning.</li>
	<li>Allow plenty of time – for example, 40 minutes – for your child to have a wind-down before turning off the lights to go to sleep. Encourage quiet activities like reading a book or magazine, drawing, writing, playing card games or doing puzzles.</li>
	<li>Turn off electronic stimulation in your child’s bedroom at least one hour before bedtime. This includes all screens – mobile phones, tablets, computer screens and TV.</li>
</ul>

<p>During puberty, children start to secrete melatonin later at night than they did in earlier childhood. This affects their circadian rhythm. It means that your child will want to go to bed later at night and get up later in the morning.</p>

<p>Your teenage child will probably sleep better and function better during the day if he has a set bedtime for school nights. You can find more information in our illustrated guide to teenage sleep habits.</p>

<h2>What can I do through the day to improve my child’s sleep?</h2>

<p>These tips for daytime might help improve your child’s sleep at night:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child a healthy breakfast to help kick-start her body clock.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to get as much natural light as possible during the day, especially in the morning. Daylight switches off your child’s melatonin and helps her wake up and be alert. Darkness switches on melatonin to make her sleepy.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to be physically active and to exercise. Physical activity helps children to sleep longer.</li>
	<li>Keep your child away from caffeine – in energy drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate and cola – especially in the late afternoon and evening.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child has a satisfying evening meal at a reasonable time. Feeling hungry or too full before bed can make your child more alert or uncomfortable. This can make it harder to get to sleep.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I stop my children from going crazy at bedtime, which is also when my partner gets home from work?</h2>

<p>It’s normal for your partner to want to have some fun with your children after work. It’s only a problem if it’s noisy, active play that makes it harder for your children to settle into bed for sleep.</p>

<p>Talk with your partner about creating a family routine that works for your family, including quiet time under dim light for an hour before the children’s bedtime. For example, your partner might be able to arrive home earlier. If this isn’t possible, your partner might be able to read quietly with the children before lights out.</p>

<h2>How can I move my child’s bedtime to an earlier time?</h2>

<p>To help your child fall asleep earlier, start with his current bedtime and change it gradually by starting the bedtime routine 15 minutes earlier about every two days. Most children will fall asleep within 20 minutes of going to bed. If your child is lying awake in bed for more than 20-30 minutes after lights out, you might need to keep bedtime at the same time for a couple of weeks before making it earlier again.</p>

<p>Try to get your child up at about the same time each morning, including on weekends. A regular morning wake time can help with keeping a regular bedtime.</p>

<h2>How can I get my six-year-old to sleep in her own bed?</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas to help your child fall asleep in her own bed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set up a regular bedtime routine – for example, bath, story and bed.</li>
	<li>Check that your child’s bedroom is dimly lit and quiet enough.</li>
	<li>Use camping out – this is a gradual and gentle technique where you sit with your child until she falls asleep, and then gradually move your chair out of the room over a period of 1-3 weeks.</li>
	<li>Encourage good sleep habits during the day – for example, getting plenty of sunlight and exercise.</li>
	<li>Praise your child when you notice she’s trying to make changes to sleep patterns. You could also try a reward chart to encourage the bedtime behaviour you want.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re planning to make changes to your child’s bedtime routine and sleep habits, it might help to explain your plans for a new bedtime routine to your child. Be consistent with sticking to the plan.</p>

<h2>How do I stop my child from calling out and getting out of bed at night?</h2>

<p>A positive bedtime routine can cut down on bedtime battles. Once your child is in bed, let her know that you expect her to stay quietly in her bed until sleep comes. Going to bed too early can make this problem worse, so think about how long it takes your child to fall asleep after the lights are turned off.</p>

<p>Read our article on calling out and getting out of bed for more tips and strategies.</p>

<h2>What do I do about my child’s head-banging and rocking to sleep?</h2>

<p>Head-banging, body-rocking and head-rolling are nearly always harmless, and your child is likely to outgrow them.</p>

<p>Try to ignore the behaviour, work on ways to reduce the noise, and keep your child safe. For example, you could move the bed away from the wall and check and tighten the bed screws. Sometimes moving the mattress onto the floor in the middle of the room helps to ease the disruption to the rest of the family. See your doctor if you’re worried.</p>

<h2>My three-year-old demands bottles of milk overnight. How can I stop this pattern?</h2>

<p>This is probably happening because your child has a habit of needing a bottle to fall asleep. When he wakes and can’t get back to sleep during the night, he calls for a bottle.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for phasing out night feeds and helping your child learn to sleep independently:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose your timing. A period of change or stress for you or your child might not be a good time to give up the bottle.</li>
	<li>Talk to your child about giving up the bottle.</li>
	<li>Encourage the use of other comforters like a blanket or teddy.</li>
	<li>When your child manages to give up the bottle, have a big celebration or give your child a reward.</li>
	<li><strong>Try not to turn back.</strong> No matter how well you’ve prepared your child for this change, expect some discomfort and some protest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I stop my five-year-old from sleepwalking?</h2>

<p>You can start by checking that your child is getting enough sleep. An earlier bedtime, or a regular bedtime, might reduce sleepwalking.</p>

<p>If your child is sleepwalking, make sure she’s safe by clearing any obstacles from the bedroom and hallways, locking the front and back doors, removing trip hazards and checking there are no sharp objects around.</p>

<p>Around 7-15% of children sleepwalk, and many sleeptalk too. Usually, it’s nothing to worry about. Children often grow out of these habits as teenagers, but see your doctor if you’re worried.</p>

<h2>My child sometimes wakes up distressed, crying and inconsolable. What should I do?</h2>

<p>If your child won’t respond to comforting or soothing but is otherwise well, he might be having a night terror. Stay calm and avoid waking or touching your child unless he’s at risk of hurting himself. Night terrors can be distressing to watch, but they don’t harm your child, and he won’t remember them in the morning.</p>

<p>Night terrors can happen if your child isn’t getting enough sleep, so it’s worth checking your child’s sleep patterns. They can also be worse or happen more often if your child is unwell or has a fever. Sometimes worries and anxieties can lead to more night terrors.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about your child’s health or wellbeing, or the night terrors seem prolonged or violent, seek professional advice.</p>

<h2>What should I do when my child has a nightmare?</h2>

<p>If your child wakes up after a nightmare, explain that it was a bad dream. Let her know that everything is OK and she is safe. A kiss and a cuddle might help your child settle again. You could also think about things that are happening during the day – like watching a scary TV show – that might be causing the nightmares.</p>

<p>It can be a good idea to seek professional advice if your child is having nightmares and is also really anxious during the day. Also seek help if your child has been through a traumatic event and is having nightmares about it.</p>

<h2><strong>My child has autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and poor sleep. How can I change this?</strong></h2>

<p>Sleep problems are common in children with ASD they often can be helped. Better sleep for these children can potentially improve their daytime functioning as well as the sleep of family members. You can manage and overcome many sleep difficulties in your child with ASD using common behaviour strategies. You can also encourage good sleep habits for your child with ASD, including regular sleep times, positive bedtime routines and appropriate bedtimes. Talk to your health professional if you’re worried.</p>

<h2>My child has a developmental delay. How can I help him sleep better?</h2>

<p>You can manage and overcome many of your child’s sleep issues using common bedtime behaviour strategies. A regular and predictable bedtime routine will help your child know that it’s time for sleep. Telling your child you expect him to stay in bed will reinforce the message.</p>

<p>You might also try strategies like camping out or returning your child to bed. Some nights you might need to take him back to bed several times. Talk to your health professional if you’re worried.</p>

1126,How to sleep better: 10 tips for children,"A routine that includes relaxing time before bed and regular bedtimes and wake times can help your child settle better. Help your child settle for sleep with a sleep environment that’s quiet and dimly lit. Make sure your child has enough food at the right time, sunlight during the day, and no caffeine in the afternoon and evening. See your GP if your child has sleep problems that go on for more than 2-4 weeks or that affect your child’s daily life.","<h2>About good sleep for children</h2>

<p>A good night’s sleep is about getting to sleep and staying asleep. Most children wake up by themselves in the morning if they’re getting enough good-quality sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Getting to sleep</strong><br />
Most children fall asleep within 20 minutes of going to bed. How long it takes to get to sleep can depend on how sleepy your child’s body is, and also on her daytime and bedtime routine. Some bedtime routines help your child wind down before bedtime, so she can fall asleep more easily.</p>

<h2>How to sleep better for children: tips</h2>

<p><strong>1. Set up a bedtime routine </strong><br />
A regular bedtime routine starting around the same time. A routine of bath, story and bed can help younger children feel ready for sleep. For older children, the routine might include a quiet chat with you about the day then some time alone relaxing before lights out.</p>

<p><strong>2. Relax before bedtime</strong><br />
Encourage your child to relax before bedtime. Older children might like to wind down by reading a book, listening to gentle music or practising breathing for relaxation. If your child takes longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep, he might need a longer wind-down time before turning the lights out to go to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>3. Keep regular sleep and wake times</strong><br />
Keep your child’s bedtimes and wake-up times within 1-2 hours of each other each day. This helps to keep your child’s body clock in a regular pattern. It’s a good idea for weekends and holidays, as well as school days.</p>

<p><strong>4. Keep older children’s naps early and short</strong><br />
Most children stop napping at 3-5 years of age. If your child over five years is still napping during the day, try to keep the nap to no longer than 20 minutes and no later than early afternoon. Longer and later naps can make it harder for children to get to sleep at night.</p>

<p><strong>5. Make sure your child feels safe at night</strong><br />
If your child feels scared about going to bed or being in the dark, you can praise and reward her whenever she’s brave. Avoiding scary TV shows, movies and computer games can help too. Some children with bedtime fears feel better when they have a night light.</p>

<p><strong>6. Check noise and light in your child’s bedroom</strong>.</p>

<p> Check whether your child’s bedroom is too light or noisy for sleep. Blue light from televisions, computer screens, phones and tablets might suppress melatonin levels and delay sleepiness. It probably helps to turn these off at least one hour before bedtime.</p>

<p><strong>7. Avoid the clock</strong><br />
If your child is checking the time often, encourage him to move his clock or watch to a spot where he can’t see it.</p>

<p><strong>8. Eat the right amount at the right time</strong><br />
Feeling hungry or too full before bed can make your child more alert or uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>9. Get plenty of natural light in the day</strong><br />
Encourage your child to get as much natural light as possible during the day, especially in the morning. Bright light suppresses melatonin. This helps your child feel awake and alert during the day and sleepy towards bedtime.</p>

<p><strong>10. Avoid caffeine</strong><br />
Caffeine is in energy drinks, coffee, tea, chocolate and cola. Avoid them in the late afternoon and evening.  </p>

<p>It’s always a good idea to praise your child when you notice she’s trying to make changes to sleep patterns or is trying out a new routine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>When worries affect your child’s sleep</h2>

<p>If your child has worries and anxieties that stop him from relaxing at bedtime, see if you can you can deal with these worries straight away, and if not, it’s probably best to acknowledge your child’s feelings and gently plan to sort things out in the morning.</p>

<p>Problems with sleep can affect your child’s mood, schoolwork or relationships. You should seek help from your GP if sleep problems go on for more than 2-4 weeks.</p>

1131,Preschooler sleep: what to expect,"Most preschoolers need 10-13 hours of sleep a night, and some still nap during the day. Preschoolers sometimes have sleep problems like getting out of bed, as well as nightmares and night terrors. A consistent bedtime routine is the best way to handle many preschooler sleep problems.","<h2>Preschooler sleep: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Children aged 3-5 years need <strong>around 10-13 hours of sleep a night</strong>. Some might also have a day nap of about an hour.</p>

<p>Sleep is important for your preschooler’s health, growth and development. When children sleep well, they’re more settled and happy during the day. Getting the right amount of sleep also strengthens your child’s immune system and reduces the risk of infection and illness.</p>

<h2>Night terrors and nightmares</h2>

<p>Night terrors and nightmares are quite common among preschoolers. Night terrors and nightmares happen at different times of the night, and they need to be managed differently.</p>

<p><strong>Night terrors</strong><br />
Night terrors happen in the first few hours of the night, when children are in deep sleep. If your child is having a night terror, he’s actually asleep although he looks like he’s awake. For example, his eyes might be open or he might be moving around. But he won’t respond to you as he normally would.</p>

<p>Night terrors can be frightening to watch, but <strong>they don’t hurt your child</strong>.</p>

<p>Don’t wake your child during a night terror, because this often makes it last longer. Instead, wait for your child to stop crying and thrashing about. Guide her back to bed if she has climbed out. Children usually settle back to sleep quickly after a night terror and have no memory of it in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>Nightmares</strong><br />
Nightmares tend to happen in the second half of the night, when children dream the most. They’re related to preschoolers’ developing imaginations. If your child has a nightmare, he might wake up upset. He’ll be able to remember the nightmare and talk to you.</p>

<p>If your child has a nightmare, she’ll need cuddles, comfort and reassurance – for example, ‘Bad dreams are very scary, aren’t they?’ Your child might take a while to go back to sleep.</p>

<h2>Bedtime routine</h2>

<p>Sleep can sometimes come more slowly for preschoolers because they’re busy thinking about the day even after they go to bed. A positive bedtime routine can help with this, especially if you follow the routine consistently, both during the week and on weekends.</p>

<p>Most preschoolers are ready for bed around 7 pm, especially if they’ve had a big day at preschool. But some can demand more and more bedtime stories as a delaying tactic. You might want to establish a two or three book rule for bedtime, with the promise to read more during the day.</p>

<p>If your child takes a dummy to bed, you might consider encouraging him to let go of the dummy around this time.</p>

<h2>Getting up after bedtime</h2>

<p>Your preschooler might go through a stage of calling out from bed or getting up after you’ve said goodnight. Try these tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid boisterous play as well as watching TV and using computers, phones or tablets close to bedtime. These activities can make it harder for your child to settle.</li>
	<li>Establish a consistent, calming bedtime routine.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child’s room is quiet, dimly lit and neither too hot nor too cold.</li>
	<li>Before leaving the room, check that your child has everything she needs for sleep, like her favourite cuddly toy or blanket. Remind her to stay quietly in bed.</li>
	<li>If you want to establish a routine that doesn’t involve going in to your child each time he calls out, try to be consistent and respond only if you think he really needs something.</li>
	<li>If your child gets out of bed, calmly ask her to go back to bed. Say that you’re just in the other room. Repeat this firmly and quietly over and over until your child doesn’t get up again.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sometimes your child might actually need something.</strong> If your child is scared of a monster under the bed, quickly check and tell your child there are no monsters. Your child might settle after this. If your child is scared of the dark, think about using a night-light.</p>

<p>If your child is having sleep problems, it’s often best to deal with them using behaviour strategies like bedtime routines. Sleep medications aren’t usually the solution to children’s sleep problems.</p>

1141,Food allergies in children,"Symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction to food include a rash, swelling, tingling mouth, sore stomach, vomiting and diarrhoea. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction to food – or anaphylaxis – include throat tightness, trouble breathing and fainting. See your doctor for a proper assessment of food allergies. Children must avoid food they’re allergic to. If they’re at risk of anaphylaxis, they might need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector.","<h2>About food allergies</h2>

<p>If you have a food allergy, your immune system reacts to a particular food when the food enters your body. This food is called an allergen.</p>

<p>Your immune system reacts by releasing histamine and other substances into your body’s tissues. This leads to the symptoms of an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>Even tiny amounts of the food you’re allergic to can cause an allergic reaction. Some reactions can happen immediately, and others can happen several hours later.</p>

<p>Allergic reactions are common. But most reactions aren’t severe and deaths are rare.</p>

<h2>Immediate-onset food allergies: symptoms</h2>

<p>The symptoms of immediate-onset food allergies <strong>usually appear within a few minutes</strong>. But sometimes symptoms can appear 1-2 hours after a child has eaten the food.</p>

<p>The symptoms of immediate-onset food allergies usually appear within a few minutes. But sometimes symptoms can appear 1-2 hours after a child has eaten the food.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Mild to moderate symptoms of immediate-onset food allergies include:</h3>

<p>•swollen lips, face or eyes</p>

<p>•skin reactions like redness, hives or eczema</p>

<p>•tingling or itchy mouth</p>

<p>•vomiting, stomach pain or diarrhoea</p>

<p>•nose congestion.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Severe allergivc reaction:</h3>

<p>A severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis, and it can also happen immediately. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:</p>

<p>•breathing difficulties</p>

<p>•tongue swelling or throat tightness</p>

<p>•a wheeze or persistent cough</p>

<p>•difficulty talking or a hoarse voice</p>

<p>•persistent dizziness or fainting</p>

<p>•paleness and floppiness (in young children)</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction and needs urgent medical attention. If your child is having an anaphylactic reaction, first lay her flat or keep her sitting. Don’t let her stand or walk around. Next use an adrenaline auto-injector like EpiPen if one is available. Then call an ambulance .</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>The most common food allergies are:</h2>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>cow’s milk</li>
	<li>hen’s eggs</li>
	<li>soybeans</li>
	<li>peanuts</li>
	<li>tree nuts like cashews, pistachios, walnuts, pecans or hazelnuts</li>
	<li>sesame</li>
	<li>wheat</li>
	<li>fish</li>
	<li>shellfish.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosing food allergies in children</h2>

<p>Your doctor might refer you to an allergy or immunology specialist for further checks and tests.</p>

<p>Tests for immediate-onset allergies include the following:</p>

<p>•Skin-prick test: your child’s skin is pricked with a special device that looks a bit like a toothpick and that contains a drop of a specific allergen. If a hive comes up where your child’s skin has been pricked, your child probably has an allergy.</p>

<p>•Blood tests: the serum specific IgE antibody test uses your child’s blood to see whether he’s sensitive to specific allergens. If your child’s blood has a high amount of antibodies, he probably has an allergy. Your child might have this test if he can’t have skin-prick testing.</p>

<p>•Oral food challenge: sometimes your child will be given the possible allergen in a safe, supervised setting. Medical and nursing staff will watch to see whether an allergic reaction happens. This test carries a risk of anaphylaxis so should be conducted only by medical specialists in a setting where anaphylaxis can be safely and quickly treated.</p>

<h2>Managing food allergies in children</h2>

<p>There’s <strong>no cure</strong> for food allergies yet, but many children grow out of them. You can also take some steps to make it easier for you and your child to live with food allergies.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid the food</strong></p>

<p>You can do two important things to help your child avoid the food:</p>

<p>•Read all food labels. Be aware that some allergenic foods have different names .</p>

<p> •Be careful when you eat out. Ask what ingredients each dish includes.</p>

<p>It’s best to avoid buffets and bain-maries (food warmers) because there’s a good chance that ingredients have been transferred from one dish to another.</p>

<p><strong>Have an action plan</strong></p>

<p>Know how to use an adrenaline auto-injector</p>

<p>If your child is at risk of anaphylaxis, he might be prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector like EpiPen®. These auto-injectors make it easy to self-inject adrenaline. Your doctor will teach you and your child (if old enough) how and when to use it.</p>

<p>It’s important that key people – like family, carers, babysitters and your child’s school – know how and when to use your child’s adrenaline auto-injector.</p>

<p><strong>Consider a medical bracelet</strong><br />
Your child might wear a medical bracelet that lets people know she has an allergy.</p>

<h2>How long do food allergies last?</h2>

<p>Most children grow out of their food allergies by 5-10 years of age, especially children who are allergic to milk, egg, soybean or wheat.</p>

<p>Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong.</p>

<h2>How to reduce your child’s risk of food allergies</h2>

<p><strong>Breastfeed</strong></p>

<p>Breastmilk is best, so it’s recommended that you exclusively breastfeed your baby until he’s ready to start eating solid foods at around six months old. It’s best to keep breastfeeding until your baby is at least 12 months old.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to a doctor or nurse about infant formula</strong></p>

<p> There’s no evidence that giving babies hydrolysed infant formula or partially hydrolysed infant formula (which is also called hypoallergenic formula) instead of standard cow’s milk formula prevents allergies.</p>

<p><strong>Introduce allergenic solids from around six months of age</strong></p>

<p>Introducing allergenic solid foods early can reduce the risk of your child developing a food allergy. All babies, including babies with a history of allergy in the family, should have solid foods that cause allergies from around six months of age.</p>

<p>These foods include well-cooked egg, peanut butter, wheat (from wheat-based breads, cereals and pasta) and cow’s milk products.</p>",8261,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1546, 1551, 1556, 1561",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/food-allergies"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/food-allergies</a></p>",en,published

Symptoms include breathing problems, throat tightness or tongue swelling, difficulty talking, wheezing, persistent cough, dizziness and fainting. Lay your child flat. Use an adrenaline auto-injector like EpiPen®. Then call an ambulance. It’s very important that children with anaphylaxis avoid the allergen that causes anaphylaxis.","<h2>About anaphylaxis</h2>

<p>Anaphylaxis is a <strong>severe, life-threatening allergic reaction</strong>.</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis happens when your child reacts to something in the environment called an allergen. Allergens might be something like food, insect stings or medication.</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis requires urgent medical attention. If your child is having an anaphylactic reaction, first lay him flat or keep him sitting. Don’t let him stand or walk around. Next use an adrenaline auto-injector like EpiPen® if one is available. Then call an ambulance.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of anaphylaxis</h2>

<p>If your child is having a severe allergic reaction, she might have one or more of the following signs or symptoms:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>difficult or noisy breathing</li>
	<li>swelling of the tongue</li>
	<li>tightness in the throat</li>
	<li>difficulty talking and/or a hoarse voice or cry</li>
	<li>a wheeze or persistent cough</li>
	<li>persistent dizziness or fainting</li>
	<li>paleness and floppiness (in young children).</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, an anaphylactic reaction might seem like a mild reaction at first but will quickly get worse. So if your child has allergies, it’s important to watch your child closely whenever she has an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis usually happens within minutes of your child being exposed to the allergen. But sometimes it can happen up to 1-2 hours later.</p>

<h2>Testing for anaphylaxis</h2>

<p><strong>It is important </strong>to identify what’s causing your child to have an allergic reaction. It is usually done by ordering allergy testing.</p>

<p>Most children with allergies to egg, cow’s milk, wheat or soy bean outgrow their allergies by the time they’re 5-10 years old.</p>

<p>Peanut, tree nut, fish and shellfish allergies are more likely to be lifelong.</p>

<h2>Treatment for anaphylaxis</h2>

<p>Adrenaline is used to treat anaphylaxis. It works very quickly to reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis.</p>

<p>If your child is at risk of anaphylaxis, he’s likely to be prescribed an <strong>adrenaline auto-injector</strong> – for example, EpiPen®.</p>

<p>It’s important that both you and your child learn how and when to use it. You and/or your child should carry the adrenaline auto-injector at all times. You can also teach others – family, friends, teachers and carers – how to use it.</p>

<p><strong>If you think your child is having a severe allergic reaction, it’s safer to give the adrenaline auto-injector than to wait! </strong></p>

<p><strong>Not giving the adrenaline auto-injector can be more harmful than giving it, even if it’s not needed.</strong></p>

<h2>Managing anaphylaxis</h2>

<p><strong>Avoid the allergen</strong><br />
It’s very important for your child to avoid the allergen that causes anaphylaxis. This can be challenging, but there are important things you can do to help your child.</p>

<p>Here’s what you can do if your child has a <strong>food allergy</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Read labels on all foods. </li>
	<li>Be careful when you eat out. </li>
	<li>Avoid any foods or cutlery that could have been in contact with the allergen. </li>
	<li>Teach your child not to share food. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what to do if your child has an allergy to <strong>insect stings</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Don’t let your child walk barefoot on grass.</li>
	<li>Avoid dressing your child in bright colours.</li>
	<li>Dress your child in long-sleeved shirts and pants when you can.</li>
	<li>Teach your child not to drink from open soft drink cans outdoors.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child has an allergy to a <strong>medication</strong>, let your doctor, pharmacist or dentist know before your child has any treatments or takes any medications.</p>

<p><strong>Let people know</strong><br />
It’s important that key people – like family, carers, babysitters and your child’s school – know that your child has a severe allergy. </p>

<p><strong>Discuss allergen immunotherapy (</strong>also called desensitisation)<strong> with an allergist.</strong></p>

1151,Anaemia,"Anaemia is most often caused by iron deficiency. Many babies and children get anaemia. See your doctor if your child looks very pale, is irritable and is very tired. Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia usually involves adding iron-rich foods to your child’s diet and giving  iron supplements to help get your child iron levels back to normal.","<h2>What is anaemia?</h2>

<p>Anaemia is when you don’t have enough red blood cells or when the blood cells don’t have enough haemoglobin.</p>

<p>There are many causes of anaemia.</p>

<h2>Iron-deficiency anaemia</h2>

<p>Anaemia most often happens because of a lack of iron, which your body needs to make haemoglobin. This type of anaemia is known as iron-deficiency anaemia.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of iron in your child’s diet</strong><br />
Your child might get iron-deficiency anaemia if he isn’t getting enough iron from his diet.</p>

<p>In <strong>babies</strong>, this might happen if your baby is exclusively breastfed beyond six months of age. By around this age, your baby has used up all the iron stores she built up when she was in the womb. Your baby can’t get the iron she needs from breastmilk alone, because it’s a poor source of iron.</p>

<p>In <strong>older children, </strong>your child might get iron-deficiency anaemia if he:</p>

<ul>
	<li>drinks too much cow’s milk or drinks tea – these drinks reduce the absorption of iron from food.</li>
	<li>doesn’t eat enough foods with iron</li>
	<li>has a condition like coeliac disease, which stops him from absorbing iron from food very well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other causes of iron-deficiency anaemia</strong><br />
Iron deficiency anaemia can especially be an issue for babies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>who were born prematurely</li>
	<li>who were very sick as newborns</li>
	<li>whose mums were iron deficient during late pregnancy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iron deficiency can also be caused by<strong> blood loss.</strong> Children may lose blood in stool due to conditions in their bowels. Adolescent girls are at risk of iron deficiency anaemia if they have frequent, long or very heavy periods.</p>

<h2>Anaemia caused by other deficiencies or problems</h2>

<p>If your child <strong>isn’t getting enough</strong> <strong>vitamin B12 or folate </strong>from her diet, she might get anaemia.</p>

<p>Another cause of anaemia is <strong>haemolysis</strong>. This is when too many red blood cells are destroyed by the body. This situation could be due to genetuc diseases such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia or to an infection.</p>

<h2>Anaemia symptoms</h2>

<p>If your child has anaemia, he might look very <strong>pale</strong>.</p>

<p>A toddler might get very <strong>tired</strong>. </p>

<p>Your child might be <strong>cranky</strong> and hard to manage. Older children might be very tired, have a poor appetite and find it hard to concentrate at school.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about anaemia symptoms</h2>

<p>Take your child to the doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>looks too pale</li>
	<li>is irritable</li>
	<li>doesn’t have much energy</li>
	<li>complains of frequent headaches</li>
	<li>isn’t putting on enough weight or is a fussy eater</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for anaemia</h2>

<p>If the doctor thinks your child might have anaemia, the doctor will usually order blood tests to find the blood level of haemoglobin. </p>

<p>There are referenrce tables with normal levels of haemoglobin for each age. </p>

<p>Occasionally, other tests are indicated to identify the cause of the anemia.</p>

<h2>Treatment for anaemia</h2>

<p>Anaemia treatment depends on the cause.</p>

<p>If your child has anaemia caused by not enough iron, adding iron-rich foods to his diet can help boost his iron levels. Iron-rich foods include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>wholegrains and iron-fortified cereals</li>
	<li>legumes – for example, lentils and beans</li>
	<li>meat – for example, red meat, chicken and fish</li>
	<li>egg yolk</li>
	<li>dark green, leafy vegetables – for example, spinach</li>
	<li>crushed sesame seeds – for example, tahini or halva.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changing your child’s diet alone might not be enough. She might also need to take <strong>iron supplements</strong> (tablets or syrup) to help get her iron levels back to normal. Iron supplements can turn your child’s poo black or grey, and might cause constipation or tummy upsets. It’s a good idea to talk to your doctor about these and other side effects.</p>

<p>Very rarely, your child might need an infusion or injection of iron.</p>

<p>If the anaemia is caused by something other than iron deficiency, your child might need more tests and treatment. </p>

<h2>Preventing anaemia</h2>

<p><strong>Babies</strong><br />
When you’re introducing solid foods to your baby’s diet at around six months of age, it’s best to include plenty of iron-rich foods.</p>

<p>In many countries it is recommended to give to all babies aged 4-18 months daily iron solution to prevent  iron deficiency.</p>

<p>You can introduce pasteurised, unflavoured, full-fat cow’s milk to your baby’s diet after 12 months of age. But try to limit the amount of cow’s milk your child drinks to no more than 500 ml a day. </p>

<p><strong>Children and teenagers</strong><br />
As your child grows, offer him plenty of healthy, nutritious food from the five food groups. A balanced diet can help prevent anaemia caused by not enough iron, folate or vitamin B12. Keep limiting cow’s milk to no more than 500ml a day.</p>

1156,Asthma: treatment and management,The basic aims of asthma treatment and management are: 1. To effectively treat an acute asthma attack. 2. preventing asthma attacks from happening so that your child can lead a normal life. Preventive therapy is also aiming at minimising the severity and length of any attacks that do happen.,"<h2>Asthma treatment: emergency action plan</h2>

<p>If your child has asthma you need an emergency action plan, regardless of how mild or severe the symptoms usually are.</p>

<p><strong>Severe asthma attack</strong><br />
Here’s what to do if your child has a severe asthma attack:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Remain calm and sit your child down.</li>
	<li>For children aged <strong>0-5 years</strong>, give 2-6 separate puffs from the inhaler (usually the blue one) through the spacer. For each puff of medication, your child should take four deep breaths before you give the next puff.</li>
	<li>For children aged <strong>six years or older</strong>, give 4-12 separate puffs from the inhaler. For each puff of medication, your child should take four deep breaths before you give the next puff.</li>
	<li>Wait around four minutes. If there’s little or no improvement, repeat step 2 or 3 above.</li>
	<li>If there’s still little or no improvement after four minutes, call an ambulance and state that your child is having an asthma attack. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, give your child puffs from the inhaler through the spacer as described above. Wait four minutes and do it again. Repeat this until the ambulance arrives.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Asthma flare-up</strong><br />
An asthma flare-up is when your child has mild asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing or mild breathlessness. If your child is experiencing these symptoms, here’s what you should do.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Remain calm and sit your child down.</li>
	<li>Give your child 2-4 separate puffs from the inhaler (usually the blue one) through the spacer. For each puff of medication, your child should take four deep breaths through the spacer before you give the next puff.</li>
	<li>Wait four minutes. If symptoms haven’t improved, repeat steps 1-3.</li>
	<li>If symptoms continue, call an ambulance and state that your child is having an asthma attack.</li>
	<li>If symptoms have improved, keep watching your child throughout the day for further flare-ups. If symptoms happen again, repeat steps 1-3.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your child needs his relief medication throughout the day or more than every 4-6 hours, he needs to see a doctor.</p>

<h2>Clinical categories of asthma</h2>

<p>Children with asthma can be grouped and managed using three clinical categories:</p>

<p><strong>Infrequent intermittent asthma</strong><br />
With this kind of asthma, symptoms happen several times a year, usually in association with a cold or other viral infection. He might wheeze or cough for a few days when he’s having a flare-up and should respond rapidly to treatment but between asthma attacks or flare-ups she’s usually in good health and leads a normal, active life with no asthma symptoms.</p>

<p>Children with infrequent intermittent asthma usually <strong>need treatment only for an acute asthma attack</strong>. They usually don’t need to take any asthma medications in between attacks. Most children with asthma fall into this group.</p>

<p><strong>Frequent intermittent asthma</strong><br />
Children with frequent intermittent asthma have several acute attacks each year, at least every six weeks.</p>

<p>If your child has frequent intermittent asthma, he might have an intermittent cough, or a wheeze triggered by exercise.</p>

<p>Some children with frequent intermittent asthma might be need to <strong>take preventer medication on a daily basis</strong> to prevent acute attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Persistent asthma</strong><br />
This is the smallest group of children with asthma. If your child has persistent asthma, she has symptoms at least once a week. Her symptoms can happen during the day or night.</p>

<p>Children with persistent asthma might need to <strong>take several preventer medications each day</strong>.</p>

<h2>Asthma relievers, preventers and controllers</h2>

<p>Asthma medications can be divided into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>relievers, which treat and relieve asthma symptoms</li>
	<li>preventers, which prevent acute attacks</li>
	<li>controllers, which are used when asthma is uncontrolled despite the use of relievers and preventers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some children take one, two or even three of these types of medications. Your doctor will tell you the most appropriate medications for your child to take.</p>

<p>Depending on your child’s needs and the severity of his asthma, there are different ways to take asthma medication including inhaling it, taking it in liquid, tablet or powder form, or having injections.</p>

<p><strong>Relievers</strong><br />
Beta-2 agonists like salbutamol (Ventolin®, Asmol®) and terbutaline (Bricanyl®. Bricalin®, Terbulin®) are the drugs most commonly used to treat acute asthma symptoms. These drugs help to relax the narrowed airway passages and make it easier for air to get through.</p>

<p>Steroids (prednisolone) are often given early during an acute attack to minimise acute inflammation. This reduces the swelling of the lining of the airway passages.</p>

<p><strong>Preventers</strong><br />
Drugs to prevent asthma are very important. They either reduce the effects of inflammation in the airways (which is the underlying cause of asthma), or they minimise factors that cause inflammation.</p>

<p>Asthma preventers include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>inhaled steroids like beclomethasone (Qvar®), budesonide (Pulmicort®. Budicort®), fluticasone (Flixotide®) and ciclesonide (Alvesco®).</li>
	<li>steroid tablets or mixtures (prednisolone), which children take by mouth</li>
	<li>montelukast (Singulair®), which is a tablet and another alternative to corticosteroids.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children who are prescribed preventative medications need to take them every day. Your child should rinse out his mouth after using his steroid inhaler to avoid getting oral thrush.</p>

<p>Inhaled steroids taken in normal doses have very few side effects. They have none of the side effects associated with the long-term use of steroids taken by mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Controllers</strong><br />
If your child’s asthma isn’t controlled by preventers and your child is more than five years old, your doctor might prescribe symptom controllers.</p>

<p>These drugs are a long-acting version of beta-2 agonists, which means they help to relax the narrowed airway passages and make it easier for air to get through.</p>

<p>Examples include Serevent® (salmeterol) and Foradil® (formoterol). <strong>These drugs must be used only in combination with a preventer</strong>. Combination inhalers like Seretide® (containing salmeterol and fluticasone), Symbicort® (containing budesonide and formoterol) and Breo Ellipta® (containing flucticasone and vilanterol) make this easier.</p>

<h2>Asthma prevention: avoiding triggers</h2>

<p>Your child should avoid exposure to cigarette smoke and avoid and being close to animals that she is allergic to. In case your child is affected by goose down or feathers, she might be better off with non-allergenic bedding might be used in cases of allergy to feathers. In some cases, when your child was dignosed with house dust mite allergy you might need to remove your carpets to minimise dust.</p>

<p>It’s OK to look at how you can balance prevention measures with the need to limit big changes to your family’s living conditions. You might not need to make big changes if your child has only mild symptoms.</p>

<h2>Understanding asthma management</h2>

<p><strong>Asthma control and management plans</strong><br />
These plans include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>knowing what triggers your child’s asthma symptoms</li>
	<li>understanding how to take the asthma medication – how much, how often and how to use the inhaler correctly</li>
	<li>knowing what to do if your child’s symptoms get worse, and what to do in an emergency if your child doesn’t respond to the drugs that he usually takes.</li>
	<li><strong>Learning how to use an inhaler is very important.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Medications</strong><br />
Asthma medicines are generally very safe, especially those that are inhaled. Children usually get into trouble because they don’t take enough asthma medication, rather than because they take too much.</p>

<p>If you think your child is experiencing side effects from medications, discuss this with your doctor.</p>

<h2>Living with asthma</h2>

<p>Most children with asthma lead perfectly normal lives.</p>

<p>Keep encouraging your child to do sports and exercise. Your child might benefit from taking his reliever medication just before exercise to prevent a wheeze or a cough from happening.</p>

<p>If your child has frequent attacks, or if symptoms stop her from playing sport, sleeping at night or feeling healthy, it’s likely that she’s being undertreated or not taking her medication. Talk to your doctor about this so the treatment can be changed if necessary.</p>

<p>Children with asthma aren’t always good at judging the severity of their symptoms – they often say they feel fine even if their asthma is poorly controlled. Keep an eye on your child’s symptoms and visit your doctor if you ever have any concerns.</p>",8981,2,"46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1936, 1941, 1946",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asthma-treatment"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asthma-treatment</a></p>",en,published
1161,Asthma: causes,"Asthma makes it really hard for children to breathe. This is because their airway passages swell when they come into contact with things that trigger their asthma, like allergens, viral infections, smoke, exercise and weather changes. Children might get asthma because of genes and the environment.","<h2>What is asthma?</h2>

<p>Children with asthma have inflammation in the small airway passages (bronchi) of their lungs. This makes their airways sensitive to triggers. Triggers are the things that bring on asthma attacks. When children come into contact with triggers, the muscles in the walls of their airway passages tighten up.</p>

<p>When this happens, children have problems getting into and maily out of their lungs. This causes wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and uncomfortable breathing.</p>

<h2>Causes of asthma: genes, inducers and triggers</h2>

<p>Children with asthma probably get genes from their parents that make it more likely that they’ll get asthma too. This is called genetic predisposition.</p>

<p>If you, your child’s other parent or other family members have asthma, eczema, hay fever or allergies, there’s an increased chance your child will also have asthma.</p>

<p><strong>Triggers of asthma: </strong>The most common trigger is a viral infection, usually the common cold. Other triggers include pollens, exercise, changes in the weather, cold air, cigarette smoke, pollution, house dust mites and pets.</p>

<p>Children with asthma react to asthma triggers by wheezing, coughing and becoming short of breath.</p>

<p>Exposure to smoke during pregnancy, or to second-hand and third-hand smoke in childhood, can lead to asthma in children who have a genetic predisposition to it.</p>

<h2>Tests for asthma</h2>

<p>Most children don’t need any special tests for asthma. Doctors usually diagnose asthma on the basis of your child’s medical history and by examining your child.</p>

<p>Children with more severe asthma, or who have frequent asthma attacks, might need special breathing tests or very occasionally an X-ray. These are often arranged by a paediatrician or respiratory specialist.</p>

<p>Older children with recurrent asthma might need to have spirometry that is an equipment that measures the flow of air in and out of lungs. The doctors might also refer your child to the allergist for allergy testings.</p>",8871,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1936, 1941, 1946",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asthma-causes"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asthma-causes</a></p>",en,published
1166,Asthma: symptoms,"Wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties can all be signs of asthma. Asthma symptoms are usually worse at night and after excercise. Asthma coughing can vary from mild to severe.","<h2>Asthma symptoms: wheezing</h2>

<p>An asthma wheeze can vary from mild to severe. Some people say it sounds like a whistle.</p>

<p>Sometimes you’ll be able to hear your child’s wheeze easily, usually when she’s breathing out.</p>

<p>Asthma wheezing is typically worse first thing in the morning or at night when the air is cooler. Other times you’ll hear a wheeze after your child has done some exercise.</p>

<p>Sometimes your child might seem to be breathing normally and quietly, but your doctor will hear signs of airway narrowing by listening to your child’s chest with a stethoscope.</p>

<h2>Asthma symptoms: coughing</h2>

<p>Asthma coughing can vary from mild to severe.</p>

<p>You’re more likely to hear the cough at night, after your child has done some exercise, or when the weather is cold.</p>

<p>Sometimes your child might have a restless sleep or wake during the night because of the cough. Sometimes coughing, especially at night, is the only sign that your child has asthma.</p>

<p>The cough might also stop your child from doing sport or other physical activity at school. Sometimes your child may have difficulty in speaking since she has trouble finishing a complete sentence without having a need to take another breath</p>

<p>The severity and frequency of asthma symptoms vary a lot. Some children wheeze or cough only a few times a year when they have a cold, whereas others (a small minority) might have some asthma symptoms every day.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about asthma symptoms</h2>

<p>Your child should <strong>see your doctor </strong>if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>his wheezing, cough or shortness of breath doesn’t go away or gets worse despite medication</li>
	<li>he needs to use his inhaler more often than every 6 hours</li>
	<li>2-6 puffs of the inhaler don’t help to make your child better immediately</li>
	<li>he can’t exercise or play normally, or can’t keep up with other children</li>
	<li>his sleep is significantly disturbed because of coughing or wheezing</li>
	<li>he needs to use his inhaler more frequently or there has been a change in his symptoms</li>
	<li>your child needs medication as soon as he wakes up in the morning, or can’t wait until after breakfast</li>
	<li>you don’t have a clear asthma control and management plan for your child.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child’s doctor will take a very careful history of how bad your child’s symptoms are and how often she has them, because your child’s asthma control and management plan will depend on these factors.</p>

<p>Your doctor should regularly review your child’s asthma control and management plan.</p>",8876,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1936, 1941, 1946",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asthma-symptoms"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/asthma-symptoms</a></p>",en,published
1171,Gastro-oesophageal reflux and GORD,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux is when your child brings the contents of his stomach back up into his food pipe or mouth. Reflux symptoms usually start within the first month of birth. Most babies grow out of reflux by the time they’re toddlers. For mild reflux, feed your baby in an upright position and keep her upright for about 30 minutes after feeds. Thickened breastmilk or formula might help.","<h2>What is gastro-oesophageal reflux?</h2>

<p>Gastro-oesophageal reflux is when your child brings the contents of his stomach back up into his food pipe or mouth.</p>

<p>It happens when the muscles between your baby’s food pipe (oesophagus) and tummy relax for a moment because they’re not fully developed.</p>

<p>This results in a type of vomiting or spitting called ‘posseting’.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux</h2>

<p>If your baby has gastro-oesophageal reflux, she might vomit milk. This can happen during, between and after feeds.</p>

<p>You’ll usually see reflux symptoms starting within the first 2 month after birth.</p>

<p><strong>Most children with reflux grow out of it</strong> by the time they’re toddlers. This is probably because they’re spending more time in an upright position by this age. They’re also eating more solid foods.</p>

<p>A few children keep having symptoms after the toddler period.</p>

<p><strong>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)</strong><br />
In some babies and children, reflux very occasionally leads to complications. In this case, your doctor might diagnose your child with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).</p>

<p>GORD symptoms include pain and discomfort in the chest or stomach, which might make your baby cranky. Your baby might cry a lot or arch his back.</p>

<p>If your baby has GORD, she might have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>disrupted sleep</li>
	<li>poor weight gain</li>
	<li>a chronic cough and wheeze</li>
	<li>blood in her vomit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about gastro-oesophageal reflux?</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>finds it difficult to swallow</li>
	<li>has a fever</li>
	<li>is irritable and difficult to settle a lot of the time</li>
	<li>won’t eat</li>
	<li>is vomiting a lot</li>
	<li>isn’t growing properly or is losing weight</li>
	<li>has a chronic cough or recurrent chest infections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take your child to a hospital emergency department if he has green fluid or blood in his vomit.</p>

<h2>Tests for gastro-oesophageal reflux</h2>

<p>Usually, your child won’t need to have any tests for reflux.</p>

<p>If your child has reflux complications or GORD, sometimes your doctor might recommend pH monitoring (checking acid levels) to see whether there’s too much acid in her food pipe. This is done by placing a tiny tube with a sensor in your child’s food pipe for 24 hours.</p>

<p>Sometimes your doctor might also want to look at the lining of your child’s food pipe using a special camera. This test is called an endoscopy and is done under a general anaesthetic.</p>

<h2>Treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux</h2>

<p>Most cases of gastro-oesophageal reflux get better by themselves with time and don’t need treatment.</p>

<p>If your baby’s reflux is mild and his weight gain isn’t affected, you could try feeding your baby in a more upright position to ease the problem. Try keeping him upright for about 30 minutes after feeds.</p>

<p>Your doctor might suggest thickening breastmilk that can be thickened with xanthum gum or carob bean based thickeners but not with cereal (since cereal is digested by the enjyme amylase in breast milk) until symptoms improve. If your baby is formula fed, your doctor might recommend thickening your baby’s formula or using prethickened formula. Thickeners should only be used in consultation with your doctor.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about your baby’s weight gain while your baby is using thickeners, talk to your doctor.</p>

<p>In some cases your doctor might prescribe anti acid medications to prvent a potentiial damage to the food pipe from the acidic fluid of the stomach.</p>

<p><strong>You should follow safe sleeping practices, even if your baby has reflux</strong>. This means putting your baby on her back to sleep. She should sleep on a firm, flat mattress that isn’t elevated in any way.</p>

1181,Lactose intolerance: babies and children,"Lactose intolerance is when the child can’t effectively break down the sugar lacose that is present in milk and dairy products. symptoms include wind, stomach pain, diarrhea and bloating.  This happens usually in children older than 5 years when the  child’s lactase enzymes gradually start to decrease. Children and teenagers with lactose intolerance should change to a healthy, low-lactose diet. See your doctorfor a proper assessment of your child’s condition.","<h2>What is lactose intolerance?</h2>

<p><strong>Lactose intolerance</strong> is when the body can’t break down lactose . This problem happens because there isn’t enough lactase in the stomach.</p>

<p><strong>Lactose</strong> is a complex sugar. It’s present in all breastmilk, dairy milk and other dairy products. It makes up around 7% of breastmilk and infant formula.</p>

<p><strong>Lactase</strong> is an enzyme. Enzymes break down food chemicals so the body can use them.</p>

<p>Lactose is important for your baby’s health and development. It provides around 40% of your baby’s energy needs and helps him absorb calcium and iron.</p>

<h2>Causes of lactose intolerance</h2>

<p>There are three main causes of lactose intolerance.</p>

<p><strong>Lactase non-persistence (hypolactasia)</strong><br />
This happens when your child’s lactase enzymes gradually start to decrease. This is genetic and <strong>very common</strong> – about 70% of people have this type of lactose intolerance. Symptoms can start to happen after the age of five but are usually more noticeable in teenagers and young adults. Children can usually still tolerate small amounts of lactose in their daily diets.</p>

<p><strong>Congenital lactase deficiency (alactasia)</strong><br />
This happens when babies are born with no lactase enzymes at all. This is genetic but <strong>extremely rare</strong>. Babies with this kind of lactose intolerance have severe diarrhoea from the first day of life. To thrive, they need a special diet from the time they’re born.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary lactose intolerance</strong><br />
This can happen if a child’s digestive system is upset by infections like gastroenteritis, which alter the lining of the stomach and small intestine. This kind of lactose intolerance is short term and usually improves after a few weeks.</p>

<p>Conditions like coeliac disease can also cause secondary lactose intolerance. Once these conditions are being managed properly, lactose intolerance should be less of a problem.</p>

<h2>Common symptoms of lactose intolerance</h2>

<p>Symptoms of lactose intolerance in <strong>babies and children</strong> include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>wind</li>
	<li>stomach pain and bloating</li>
	<li>diarrhoea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes lactose intolerance is confused with food allergies like cow’s milk allergy. Some common food allergy symptoms include vomiting, blood or mucus in diarrhoea, hives and swelling around the eyes – <strong>these aren’t symptoms of lactose intolerance</strong>. If your child has symptoms like these, you should see your doctor for a proper assessment.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing lactose intolerance</h2>

<p>These are the two main ways to diagnose lactose intolerance:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Hydrogen breath test</strong>: this tests the amount of hydrogen gas in a child’s breath following eating a certain amoung of lactose containing food. Lactose-intolerant children have higher levels of hydrogen in their breath.</li>
	<li><strong>Elimination diet</strong>: this involves removing foods containing lactose from a child’s diet to see whether symptoms improve. If the symptoms come back once the foods with lactose are reintroduced, lactose intolerance is apparently  the cause of the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because some of the symptoms of lactose intolerance and food allergy are similar, diagnosing lactose intolerance can sometimes be tricky.</p>

<h2>Treatment: lactose intolerance in babies</h2>

<p><strong>Congenital lactase deficiency</strong><br />
If your baby has congenital lactase deficiency, your doctor will guide your child’s treatment. Again, this is an extremely rare condition. </p>

<p><strong>Secondary lactose intolerance</strong><br />
For a breastfed baby with secondary lactose intolerance caused by gastroenteritis, y<strong>ou should be able to continue breastfeeding.</strong></p>

<p>If your baby is formula fed or you’re considering giving him formula, consult your doctor or a dietitian before using or changing to a low-lactose or lactose-free infant formula. If your child is under six months, avoid using soy-based infant formula.</p>

<h2>Treatment and management: lactose intolerance in older children </h2>

<p>If your older child is diagnosed with lactose intolerance, you can reduce the amount of lactose in her diet. But you don’t need to get rid of products with lactose completely, especially if your child eats only small amounts of them with other foods during the day.</p>

<p>The following food and diet tips can help.</p>

<p>These foods are <strong>OK</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>cheeses with very low lactose content – brie, camembert, cheddar, colby, edam, fetta, gouda, havarti, mozzarella, parmesan, halloumi, Swiss and Tilstat</li>
	<li>yoghurt – the bacteria in yoghurt breaks down the lactose so it’s usually fine for your child to eat</li>
	<li>calcium-fortified soy products – soy yoghurt, soy milk, soy ice-cream and soy cheese</li>
	<li>lactose-free cow’s milk</li>
	<li>butter and cream – these contain only small amounts of lactose and are usually fine to eat</li>
	<li>bread, cereals, fruit, vegetables, meat and other protein foods</li>
	<li>full-fat milk – the fat in full-fat milk gives your child’s body longer to digest lactose.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Watch out</strong> for these foods:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>milk ice-cream and milk desserts</li>
	<li>cream cheese, processed cheese and cheese spread</li>
	<li>muesli bars</li>
	<li>instant mashed potato and vegetables with added milk or white sauces.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Check the ingredients</strong> in these foods:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>biscuits, cakes and cake mixes</li>
	<li>soups</li>
	<li>mayonnaise</li>
	<li>milk chocolate.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also talk to your doctor  if you’re thinking of using Lacteeze tablets or drops that break the sugar lactose sugar eaten by your child. </p>",5371,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1581, 1586, 1591, 1596, 3166, 3171, 3161",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/lactose-intolerance"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/lactose-intolerance</a></p>",en,published
1186,Non-food allergies in children,"If children have allergies to things like house dust mites, tree or grass pollens, animals, latex, insect stings and bites, they need to avoid these allergens. Symptoms of a mild or moderate allergic reaction include a rash, swelling, tingling, sore stomach, vomiting, hay fever and asthma. Symptoms of a severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis include mouth swelling, throat tightness, a hoarse voice, trouble breathing and fainting. Talk to your doctor about your child’s allergy.","<h2>Non-food allergies</h2>

<p>Many children are allergic to ordinary things in our homes and environment, like house dust mites, insect stings and bites, pets, grasses, weeds and other pollens. Symotoms of alergy fom mild – moderate to severe reactions.</p>

<p>If you think your child might have allergies, talk to your doctor who doctor might refer you to an allergy specialist, who can assess your child using several methods including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Skin-prick test: your child’s skin is pricked with a special device that looks a bit like a toothpick and that contains a drop of a specific allergen. If a hive comes up where your child’s skin has been pricked, your child probably has an allergy.</li>
	<li>Blood tests: To look for specific IgE antibody (antibody that causes allegic reaction) directed again a certain suspected allergen. If your child’s blood has a high amount of these specific antibodies, he probably has an allergy. Your child might have this test if he can’t have skin-prick testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mild or moderate allergic reaction</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong> of a mild or moderate allergic reaction usually include one or more of the following:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>rash, hives or welts</li>
	<li>swelling of the face, eyes or lips</li>
	<li>tingling mouth</li>
	<li>eczema, hay fever or asthma symptoms – these symptoms might be worse than usual</li>
	<li>diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do about mild to moderate reactions</strong><br />
If you think your child is having a mild to moderate allergic reaction, you can give your child a dose of antihistamine.</p>

<p>In fact, having an antihistamine in your home’s first aid kit is a good idea.</p>

<p>Mild and moderate allergic reactions are common, but deaths from allergic reactions are rare. Deaths can happen when there’s a delay in giving life-saving medication to the person having the reaction.</p>

<h2>Severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis</h2>

<p>A severe allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Symptoms might include one or more of the following:</p>

<p>•difficult or noisy breathing</p>

<p>•tongue and throat swelling or tightness</p>

<p>•trouble talking or a hoarse voice</p>

<p>•a wheeze or persistent cough</p>

<p>•persistent dizziness or fainting</p>

<p>•paleness and floppiness (for young children)</p>

<p>•low blood pressure</p>

<p>•diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting after an insect bite or sting.</p>

<p>Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction and needs urgent medical attention. If your child is having an anaphylactic reaction, first lay her flat or keep her sitting. Don’t let her stand or walk around. Next use an adrenaline auto-injector like EpiPen. Then call an ambulance</p>

<h2>Medication allergies</h2>

<p>Your child might develop a rash or swelling when taking prescription medications like antibiotics. This might be because he has an allergy to the medication. But sometimes rashes and swelling might be caused by an underlying infection rather than an allergy.</p>

<p>If your child has diarrhoea or vomiting after taking medication, it’s probably not an allergic reaction. It’s more likely to be caused by illness or the effect of the medications on the stomach.</p>

<p>Reactions to vaccinations at the site where they’re injected are common and usually include pain, redness and swelling. Your child might also get a mild fever. True allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare.</p>

<p>If your child has a reaction to a medication, it’s best to talk with your GP.</p>

<h2>Examples of Common allergens:</h2>

<h3>Dust mite allergy</h3>

<p>Dust mites live in almost every home except for dry and high regions (areas higher than 1,500 m above sea level) . They live in warm, moist places like mattresses, pillows, soft toys, soft furnishings and carpet.</p>

<p>The usual symptoms of dust mite allergy include hay fever, eczema and asthma.</p>

<p>Dust mite allergies aren’t seasonal – they happen throughout the year.</p>

<p>Prevention</p>

<p>It’s best to focus on your child’s bed and bedroom. You can reduce dust mites in these areas by:</p>

<p>•covering your child’s bed with a dust mite cover, which will keep dust mites away from your child when he’s sleeping</p>

<p>•washing sheets and pillow cases every week in 60°C water</p>

<p>•washing blankets, doonas and dust mite covers every two months in hot water</p>

<p>•removing all soft toys from the bedroom, or washing them weekly.</p>

<p>•trying not to have carpets in your home where possible or vacuuming them frequently.</p>

<h3>Pet Allergy</h3>

<p>Children can become allergic to the hair, dander and saliva of animals like cats, dogs, horses and rabbits.</p>

<p>Prevention:</p>

<p> If your family pet is the problem, the best way for your child to avoid contact is to keep the animal outside. Don’t let the animal sleep on your child’s bed or in your child’s bedroom.</p>

<h3>Allergies to grasses, weeds and pollens</h3>

<p>These allergies tend to be worse in the spring and summer months, when grasses and other plants are flowering.</p>

<p>Prevention</p>

<p>•keeping windows and doors shut and staying inside on days with high pollen counts and windy days</p>

<p>•getting your child to have a bath or shower after playing outside, especially if your child feels itchy.</p>

<h3>Latex allergy</h3>

<p>A latex allergy could be the problem if your child develops redness, a rash or swelling after contact with a product that contains latex. This could be balloons, rubber gloves, baby bottle teats or dummies.</p>

<p>If your child has a latex allergy, you’ll need to tell all medical, dental and other health care professionals who see your child. They must avoid using latex products around her.</p>

<p>Some people have an anaphylactic reaction to latex. If your child experiences any of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, lay him flat, give him an adrenaline auto-injector (if available) and call an ambulance.</p>

1191,Hives,"Hives or urticaria is a common skin condition. It looks like raised white, pink or red spots that form a very itchy rash. The rash often comes up on a child’s chest, tummy or back, but it can occur anywhere. It’s a good idea to see your doctor if you think your child has hives.","<h2>Causes of hives or urticaria</h2>

<p>Hives or urticaria can develop when the body releases histamines as part of an allergic reaction. The histamines make small blood vessels in the skin open up and leak fluid, which forms raised red blotches on the skin surface.</p>

<p>Your child might have an allergic reaction to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>certain types of foods – for example, nuts, eggs, shellfish, strawberries, tomatoes and cow’s milk</li>
	<li>food colourings, spices and preservatives</li>
	<li>plants</li>
	<li>medicines – for example, penicillin</li>
	<li>insect bites – for example, bee or wasp stings.</li>
	<li>Physical stimuli such as exposure of your child skin to cold or hot or vibratory stimuli.</li>
</ul>

<p>Viral infections like those that cause colds or diarrhoea are afequents cause for hives in children.</p>

<p>Your child might also develop itchy skin (with or without hives spots) because of heat, or tight-fitting or scratchy clothing, particularly if your child has eczema (dermatitis). This is a kind of physical irritation of sensitive skin, not an allergy.</p>

<p><strong>Hives are very common but not contagious.</strong></p>

<h2>Symptoms of hives or urticaria</h2>

<p>Your child will probably complain of a really bad itch and lumps. You’ll see small, raised, white, pink or red spots that can merge together to form large patches anywhere on the skin.</p>

<p>True hives last between a few hours and 24 hours and then, reappear in different areas of the skin. When they go, there’s no scarring.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about hives or urticaria</h2>

<p>You should see your doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child’s lips or tongue swells</li>
	<li>your child has trouble breathing or is wheezing</li>
	<li>your child is generally unwell or has a fever in addition to the hives</li>
	<li>the hives come up straight after your child takes any sort of medicine</li>
	<li>the hives keep coming back for longer than six weeks</li>
	<li>your child is itchy, uncomfortable or finding it hard to sleep because of the hives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hives are usually harmless, but sometimes they might be a sign of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires urgent medical attention. If your child has hives and is also having difficulty breathing, seems to have a swollen tongue or throat or has collapsed, <strong>call an ambulance immediately. </strong></p>

<h2>Treatment for hives</h2>

<p>Rubbing and scratching the hives will make them worse. Try to get your child to stop scratching.</p>

<p>To <strong>relieve the itch</strong>, you can apply lots of calamine lotion to the hives and let it dry. Putting cold packs on the hives or giving your child a cool shower or bath can also help.</p>

<p>Your doctor might suggest using antihistamine medication until the hives get better. It’s best to take the antihistamine regularly until the rash clears. </p>

<p>If the hives keep coming back after your child stops taking the antihistamine, see your doctor</p>

<p>In severe cases of hives, the doctor might prescribe a short course of corticosteroid tablets.</p>

<h2>Prevention of hives or urticaria</h2>

<p>In most cases there is no need for further treatment or tests once the hives went away.</p>

<p>In recurrent  or prolonged cases try to work out what has caused your child’s allergic reaction. This way, your child can keep away from it in the future. In such cases the doctor may send to child for allergy  and immunologic tests. </p>",8901,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"1991, 1996",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/hives"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/hives</a></p>",en,published

But if your child has any kind of severe or unusual reaction to an insect bite or sting, you should seek medical attention immediately.","<h2>Bee stings</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
Your child will feel severe pain at the site of the sting, which will usually swell up very quickly.</p>

<p>Bee stings have barbs on the end of them, which stay in the skin with the venom gland. The bee dies after injecting the sting.</p>

<p>If your child is allergic to bee venom, she’s at risk of a severe allergic reaction to bee stings. She might develop a widespread rash, have difficulty breathing and collapse.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
Remove the insect carefully. If it’s dead, keep it so your doctor can identify it. Avoid squeezing out the bee sting, because this will inject more venom into the wound. Instead, scrape off the sting if you can.</p>

<p>Apply ice to the area to reduce the swelling. You can give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses to ease the pain. Antihistamine medication can relieve itching.</p>

<p>If your child has a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting,<strong> call an ambulance immediately.</strong></p>

<h2>Centipede bites</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
Centipedes bite using their front fangs. Their venom isn’t poisonous, but their bites can cause severe pain and swelling.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
Give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses. You can apply ice to the bite. If the pain doesn’t go away, see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Flea bites</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
If you notice small, itchy red marks on your ankles or your children’s ankles, it’s possible there are fleas in your home.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong><br />
You can buy special preparations to treat your household pets for fleas. Pets can carry fleas, especially in the summer months.</p>

<p>You should also spray your carpets and furniture. Fleas can live in your carpet and furniture for several months, and can jump up from these places onto humans. If you’ve moved into a new house and the previous owners kept pets, it’s a good idea to spray the carpet against fleas.</p>

<h2>Mosquito bites</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
Allergic responses to mosquito bites can vary a lot. Some children who are sensitive to mosquito bites can develop very itchy red lumps around the bites. If children get mosquito bites on their faces, this can lead to a lot of swelling.</p>

<p>Some mosquitoes in some parts of the world may carry diseases such as malia in Africa.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
Applying calamine lotion or a fragrance free, non-irritating moisturiser regularly to the area can help ease the itch. Sometimes an ice pack can help reduce swelling.</p>

<p>Your doctor might prescribe a corticosteroid or antihistamine ointment to help with itching.</p>

<p>If your child has severe swelling and itching around the mosquito bite, it might stop your child from sleeping. Antihistamine tablets or syrup can help reduce itching, and some might help your child to sleep. But check with your GP or pharmacist about whether these treatments are appropriate for your child’s age.</p>

<p>To prevent infection, try to stop your child from scratching at the bite. It might help to keep your child’s fingernails short.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong><br />
Placing a net over your baby’s cot is the safest way to protect him from mosquitoes. When taking your baby outdoors, make sure he’s dressed in light-coloured clothing with long sleeves and trousers.</p>

<p>If your child is older than one year, you can apply a small amount of insect repellent. The most effective ones contain an ingredient called DEET. Repellents with up to 10% DEET are OK for children.</p>

<p>Try to keep insect repellent away your child’s mouth, eyes and any broken skin. It might be better to use a roll-on rather than a spray. You can also apply repellent to clothing rather than directly to the skin. Some insect repellents can stain or damage fabric so test the repellent on some fabric first.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes can be a problem in summer, and they’re most active at dusk and night. It’s best to take extra care at these times.</p>

<h2>Spider bites</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
Spider bites can cause severe pain and swelling.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
If you think your child has been bitten by a spider, see your doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child’s pain persists</li>
	<li>the bite looks infected</li>
	<li>your child starts to feel unwell or has vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, sweating or headache</li>
</ul>

<h2>Wasp stings</h2>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
Wasps can sting many times during one attack.</p>

<p>Wasp stings usually cause pain and swelling, but allergic reactions aren’t common.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong><br />
Remove the insect carefully. If it’s dead, keep it so your doctor can identify it. Apply ice to the area and use medication like paracetamol and antihistamine to reduce swelling and pain.</p>

<p>If your child has persistent pain, or develops sudden difficulty breathing after being stung, seek immediate medical attention.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong><br />
Be careful about drinking straight from open soft drink cans if you’re outside. Wasps are attracted to sugar and might go into the can, then sting whoever drinks from it.</p>",8906,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/insect-bites-stings"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/insect-bites-stings</a></p>",en,published
1216,Birthmarks,"Babies can have various birthmarks. Most birthmarks fade with time, and specialised laser techniques can often fade or reduce birthmarks that don’t go away by themselves. Your doctor will let you know what to do about your child’s birthmarks.","<h2>Mongolian spots</h2>

<p>Mongolian spot birthmarks are distinctive blue, flat marks that appear on a baby’s lower back or buttocks at birth or soon after. They’re more common in darker-skinned people, but can happen in lighter-skinned people too.</p>

<p>These birthmarks are caused by a build-up of pigment cells (which give colour to skin) in the deeper part of the skin. They can be small or big. They’re all harmless, and most will fade a lot within two years of birth.</p>

<p>Mongolian spots are also called dermal melanocytosis.</p>

<h2>Café-au-lait macules</h2>

<p>These common birthmarks are light-brown, flat spots, which can appear anywhere on the skin. Some children can have up to five of them over their bodies by puberty, which can be normal. If your child has lots of café-au-lait macules as a baby, it’s a good idea to see your doctor for further investigation.</p>

<p>You might hear café-au-lait macules called CALMs.</p>

<h2>Port wine stains or vascular malformations</h2>

<p>These birthmarks are large pink or red marks caused by tiny blood vessels that have expanded. They’re present from birth. Both boys and girls get them.</p>

<p>Port wine stains can appear anywhere on the body, most commonly on one side of the face, but it can affect other areas of the body. Their colour might get darker as children grow, and they might also thicken and become lumpy. They don’t fade with time.</p>

<p>Some port wine stains fade after vascular laser treatment. Laser treatment can’t completely remove these birthmarks, but it can usually lighten them a lot. Specialists recommend that treatment starts early in life. It’s best if it’s completed well before children start school, where they might be teased and feel embarrassed if they have these birthmarks.</p>

<p>If your child is born with a port wine stain, ask your doctor to refer you to a paediatric dermatologist who treats these conditions.</p>

<h2>Salmon patches or stork marks</h2>

<p>These birthmarks are pale pink, flat marks that are present at birth. You might see them over the baby’s forehead (usually called angel’s kiss), on the bridge of the nose, on the eyelids, or on the back of the neck (stork mark).</p>

<p>These birthmarks are very common, and most fade completely with time, leaving no marks by three years. Salmon patches on the back of the neck can stay into adult life.</p>

<p>Salmon patches or stork marks are also called naevus simplex birthmarks.</p>

<h2>Infantile strawberry haemangiomas</h2>

<p>Infantile haemangiomas are common. They’re small red, flat marks that appear in the first weeks of life anywhere on the body. They’re caused by an overgrowth of blood vessel cells.</p>

<p>As babies grow, the marks might start to get bigger and look raised and lumpy. After a year the marks usually start to shrink. They usually disappear by the time children are 10 years old, but they can leave loose skin in their place.  If your child has more than one, your doctor may want to examine your child for the possibility of internal hemangiomas.</p>

<p>If the haemangioma is large, or over a child’s eye, nose, lips or genitals, the mark should be treated to prevent complications like an ulcer, infection or scarring.</p>

<p>Depending on the site and size of the haemangioma, a child might need to use a beta blocker (propranolol) medication to stop growth and prevent complications. Some early or thin marks can be treated with a beta blocker gel applied directly to the skin. A paediatric dermatologist will prescribe and supervise these treatments.</p>

<p>Laser treatment is sometimes used to treat a haemangioma, particularly if the treatment can start before the haemangioma grows bigger. But this treatment can be painful, and your child will probably need several sessions.</p>

<p>Infantile haemangiomas appear in up to 10% of newborn babies. </p>

1221,Nosebleeds,"Nosebleeds are very common. They’re usually nothing to worry about. Apply firm pressure to your child’s nose for 10 minutes. Repeat for 10 minutes if the nosebleed doesn’t stop.If you can’t stop the bleeding, take your child to the doctor or a hospital emergency department.","<h2>About nosebleeds in children</h2>

<p>Nosebleeds are <strong>very common</strong> in children. Some children get a lot of nosebleeds.</p>

<p>Children can get nosebleeds if they:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>pick at their noses</li>
	<li>bump their noses or blow their noses too hard</li>
	<li>get foreign objects stuck up their noses</li>
	<li>have allergies</li>
	<li>get infections in their noses, throats or sinuses</li>
	<li>use medications like nose sprays incorrectly</li>
	<li>strain to do poos when they’re constipated</li>
	<li>have irritated noses because of dry air.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rare causes of nosebleeds include bleeding disorders, rare blood vessel disorders and other underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>With a nosebleed, it helps to remember that although it might look like a lot of blood, usually there isn’t that much.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about nosebleeds?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see your GP if:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>the bleeding hasn’t stopped after 20 minutes, despite firm pressure on the nose</li>
	<li>your child is also generally unwell, looks pale or has unexplained bruises on her body</li>
	<li>your child is less than two years old and has a bleeding nose</li>
	<li>your child has regular nosebleeds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nosebleed treatment</h2>

<p>The first step to treating a nosebleed is to <strong>stay calm</strong>. This will help settle your child if he’s upset by the sight and taste of blood. Crying can make the nosebleed worse.</p>

<p>Then the next step is to <strong>apply firm pressure</strong> with your finger and thumb on the sides of the nostrils (the soft part of the nose).</p>

<p><strong>Continue this for 10 minutes</strong> with your child sitting up and keeping her head still and slightly tilted forward. Don’t lie her down or tilt her head back. Wait the full 10 minutes. Don’t keep checking to see whether the bleeding has stopped.</p>

<p>If your child’s nose is still bleeding after 10 minutes of pressure, repeat the process for another 10 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>If the bleeding stops</strong><br />
Encourage your child not to blow or pick his nose for about 24 hours. This will help the blood clot in his nose to strengthen.</p>

<p>Your child might vomit during or after a nosebleed if she has swallowed some blood. This is pretty normal, and your child should spit out the blood.</p>

<p><strong>If the bleeding won’t stop</strong><br />
If you can’t stop the bleeding with the treatment steps above, you should take your child to the doctor or hospital emergency department.</p>

<p>The doctor might put some cream or ointment up your child’s nose to help stop the bleeding.</p>

<p><strong>Nose-packing</strong><br />
This is a common treatment for nosebleeds. The doctor puts a special cloth dressing into your child’s nose. If the dressing isn’t dissolvable, your child might need a follow-up appointment 24-48 hours later to have it taken out.</p>

<p><strong>Cautery</strong><br />
This is another common treatment for nosebleeds. The doctor uses a special chemical to seal off the bleeding and ‘freeze’ the blood vessel. Doctors usually use anaesthetic for cautery.</p>

<p>Very rarely your child might need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist and go into hospital for treatment.</p>

<h2>After a nosebleed</h2>

<p>Here’s what to do after your child has had a nosebleed:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Ensure your child rests over the next 24 hours.</li>
	<li>Keep your child out of hot baths.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child not to pick or blow his nose.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a doctor will recommend that your child uses a saline nasal spray or lubricating ointment to help with dryness. The doctor might also recommend using an  ointment, which you’ll need to put up your child’s nose.</p>",5091,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021, 2026, 2031, 2036, 2041",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/nosebleeds"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/nosebleeds</a></p>",en,published
1226,Bronchitis,"Bronchitis is an inflammation of the large airway passages that connect the windpipe to the lungs. If your child has bronchitis, she might breathe harder and produce more mucus than normal, but it’s usually nothing to worry about. Bronchitis treatment depends on the cause of the infection.","<h2>Causes of bronchitis</h2>

<p>Bronchitis is when the large airway passages that go to the lungs become inflamed, usually because of a viral infection, or more rarely a bacterial infection.</p>

<h2>Bronchitis symptoms</h2>

<p>Coughing is the main symptom of bronchitis. Your child’s cough might sound dry or wet.</p>

<p>If your child has bronchitis and his upper airways are also affected, he might have a runny nose and sore throat as well as a cough. He might have a mild fever too. He might be a bit short of breath and have some wheezing.</p>

<p>If your child is wheezing a lot and is short of breath, it could be asthma or bronchiolitis. Severe coughing and wheezing in children is more likely to be caused by asthma than by bronchitis. If your child has a high fever and difficulty breathing, it might be pneumonia.</p>

<p>Your doctor  will work out what’s causing your child’s symptoms.</p>

<p>Bronchitis is more common in adults, but it can occur in children.</p>

<p>If the cough started suddenly and you suspect your child might be choking on something, you should start choking first aid and seek immediate medical attention.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about bronchitis symptoms</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see your doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has had asthma attacks in the past</li>
	<li>has a high fever</li>
	<li>has a cough that isn’t settling down after 5-7 days</li>
	<li>has a wheeze or is short of breath</li>
	<li>has blood in her mucus</li>
	<li>is having trouble breathing or is breathing heavily.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for bronchitis</h2>

<p>Your doctor can tell whether your child is likely to have bronchitis by asking you questions about your child’s symptoms and by examining your child.</p>

<p>The doctor might also refer your child for a chest X-ray if the cough doesn’t go away.</p>

<h2>Bronchitis treatment</h2>

<p>Bronchitis <strong>usually takes 1-2 weeks to sort itself out</strong>, and generally doesn’t cause any complications.</p>

<p>If your child’s coughing and wheezing don’t go away, your doctor might advise some short-term use of anti-asthma medication.</p>

<p>If your doctor thinks a bacterial infection is causing the bronchitis or if the cough won’t go away, the doctor might prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics aren’t often prescribed, however, because bronchitis is usually caused by a virus, and antibiotics won’t work for viruses.</p>

<p>Cough medicines usually don’t help a bronchitis cough. Honey might reduce the severity and duration of a bronchitis cough, but you shouldn’t give honey to children aged under 12 months because of the risk of infant botulism, a rare but serious type of food poisoning.</p>",8881,2,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"5191, 3981, 131",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/bronchitis"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/bronchitis</a></p>",en,published
1231,Bronchiolitis,"Bronchiolitis is a common infection caused by a virus. It affects small breathing tubes in the lungs of babies and young children, causing them to become narrowed by mucus and inflammation. See your doctor if you think your child has bronchiolitis symptoms.","<h2>Causes of bronchiolitis</h2>

<p>Bronchiolitis can be caused by many different viruses, but it’s most often caused by a virus called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This virus spreads through sneezing, coughing or personal contact.</p>

<h2>Bronchiolitis symptoms</h2>

<p>When bronchiolitis starts, bronchiolitis symptoms look a bit like a cold. They include a runny nose and sneezing, a mild cough and sometimes a fever.</p>

<p>As bronchiolitis develops, your child’s breathing might become fast and laboured and her cough might get more severe.</p>

<p>You might notice signs that your child is working hard to breathe – for example, his ribs moving in and out more than usual, and his nostrils flaring. You might also hear a high-pitched whistling sound called a ‘wheeze’ when your child breathes out. In severe cases, your child’s lips might look blue.</p>

<p>Your child might be hard to feed and she might get quite upset.</p>

<p>Bronchiolitis is usually at its worst on the second or third day, but it can last for up to 10 days. As your baby improves, the wheezing and the fast breathing settles. The cough can last longer.</p>

<p>Bronchiolitis is most common in babies and young children.</p>

<p>Bronchiolitis has similar symptoms to asthma, but it’s a different condition and needs different treatment.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about bronchiolitis symptoms</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see your doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is breathing very fast or has irregular breathing</li>
	<li>is coughing and distressed</li>
	<li>has difficulty feeding or drinking and has fewer wet nappies than usual</li>
	<li>is changing colour in the face when he coughs.</li>
	<li>is tired or more sleepy than usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>Take your child to hospital immediately if she becomes short of breath, has difficulty breathing or looks blue around the lips.</p>

<h2>Treatment for bronchiolitis</h2>

<p>If your child’s <strong>bronchiolitis is mild</strong>, you’ll be able to manage it at home:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If your <strong>breastfed child</strong> is younger than six months, offer shorter and more often breastfeeds.</li>
	<li>If your <strong>formula-fed child</strong> is younger than six months, offer him his usual amount of formula. You might need to feed him smaller amounts more frequently if he’s unwell.</li>
	<li>If your child is <strong>older than six months</strong>, keep breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. You can also offer your child clear fluids, like water. If your child isn’t hungry while she has a fever, that’s OK.</li>
	<li>Give your child paracetamol according to directions if he has a fever.</li>
	<li>Ensure that your child gets as much rest as possible.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child is in a smoke-free environment. Also avoid contact with other babies and children in the first few days, because bronchiolitis is an infectious disease.</li>
</ul>

<p>You child doesn’t need antibiotics, because bronchiolitis is caused by a virus, and antibiotics don’t cure viruses.</p>

<p>If your child’s <strong>bronchiolitis is more serious</strong>, she might need to go to hospital. This is usually because she isn’t feeding properly, has become dehydrated, or needs oxygen. Your doctor will tell you whether your child needs to go to hospital.</p>

<p>Your child might need fluids via a nose tube or a drip into a vein in his arm. Sometimes your child might be given asthma medication like Ventolin®. This might help some children breathe more easily by opening up their airways, but it’s generally not effective in children with bronchiolitis..</p>",8886,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"5106, 781, 5111, 5116",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/bronchiolitis"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/bronchiolitis</a></p>",en,published
1236,Cough,"Lots of children get coughs, and their coughs tend to hang around. A cough can be upsetting for your child – and for you too! – but most coughs don’t need any special treatment.","<h2>Causes of coughs</h2>

<p>There are many causes of coughs in children, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>viral infections, like colds and flus </li>
	<li>bacterial respiratory tract infections, but these are rare</li>
	<li>irritations, like cold air, smoke, pollution or an inhaled foreign object</li>
	<li>allergies and asthma</li>
	<li>psychological reasons – for example, a habit cough.</li>
</ul>

<p>By far the most common cause of coughing is a viral infection, when the cough usually happens as part of a cold. </p>

<p>The next most common cause of coughing is asthma.</p>

<p>Other causes of a cough are relatively uncommon.</p>

<h2>Cough symptoms</h2>

<p>Your child’s cough and any other symptoms will vary according to the cause of the cough.</p>

<p>A <strong>cough that follows a cold</strong> will typically be loose and sometimes produce mucus. It’s often worse at night. This is because when your child lies down, mucus drips from the back of her nose and mouth into her windpipe. </p>

<p>An <strong>asthma cough</strong> is often worse at night and after exercise. Your child might also have a wheeze and breathing difficulties like shortness of breath.</p>

<p>A barking, hoarse cough could mean that your child has croup.</p>

<p>If your child starts coughing suddenly and also wheezing following a choking episode, he might have inhaled a foreign object.</p>

<p>If your child gets bouts of coughing for many weeks, with  ‘whooping’ when she breathes in, and accompanied by redness of face, nausea and vomiting it might be whooping cough.</p>

<p>In an older child or teenage child, a cough might become a habit. Usually these coughs are ‘honking’ coughs and don’t happen when the child is asleep.</p>

<h2>When to see your GP about a cough</h2>

<p>If your child has one or more of the following symptoms, you should take him to see the GP:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The cough goes on for longer than two weeks with or without a cold.</li>
	<li>The cough starts suddenly.</li>
	<li>The cough is interfering a lot with your child’s sleep or daily life.</li>
	<li>Your child has any difficulty with breathing.</li>
	<li>Your child has a high fever.</li>
	<li>Your child’s skin changes colour, and turns blue or very pale.</li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases, your child won’t need to see the doctor if she’s otherwise well except for her cough.</p>

<h2>Tests for cough</h2>

<p>Most children with coughs don’t need any tests.</p>

<p>The doctor can usually work out the cause of the cough by taking a careful history, and also by examining your child.</p>

<p>The doctor might sometimes order a chest X-ray or blood tests.</p>

<h2>Treatment for cough</h2>

<p>Most cases of cough do not need any special treatment. </p>

<p>Most children don’t need antibiotics for a cough. </p>

<p>If your child’s cough is caused by asthma, it can be treated with anti-asthma medication given by nebulizer or puffer.</p>

<p>Tobacco smoke can make your child’s cough worse, so keep your home smoke-free.</p>

<p><strong>Cough medicines </strong> don’t make any difference to a cough.</p>

<p><strong>Vaporisers</strong> and humidifiers don’t make coughing better. Also, young children might accidentally swallow the vaporiser solution (usually containing menthol or eucalyptus) or burn themselves.</p>

<p>Honey might reduce duration of cough, but it you shouldn’t give honey to children younger than 12 months because of the risk of infantile botulism.</p>

<p>Usually a cough following a cold will improve with time, no matter how you treat it.</p>

<h2>Cough prevention</h2>

<p>If your child’s cough is caused by asthma, you can usually prevent it with appropriate treatment.</p>

<p>Wooping cough is largely prevented by routine vaccinations!</p>

<p>You should minimise the risk of inhaling foreign objects by not letting toddlers and infants eat whole nuts or play with small objects that they can easily inhale.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can’t prevent a cough caused by a viral infection.</p>",8911,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"776, 2046, 2051",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cough"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cough</a></p>",en,published
1241,Croup,Croup is very common in young children and happens most often in children under five years old. It’s usually associated with a cold (and is therefore more common in winter). It’s usually not serious. In severe cases It is important to exclude inhalation of foriegn object.,"<h2>Croup symptoms</h2>

<p>Croup may be accompanied by cold ymptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, fever and irritability. If he has croup, he’ll develop a harsh, barking cough, sometimes a hoarse voice, and then noisy breathing, which is called <strong>stridor</strong>.</p>

<p>The noisy breathing and cough are usually worse at night. They can also get worse if your child gets upset. In most children, the symptoms improve over a few days then disappear.</p>

<p>In a few children, the croup is more severe and <strong>causes trouble breathing</strong>. In this case, your child needs urgent medical attention, and sometimes observation and treatment in hospital.</p>

<p>Common signs of your child having trouble breathing include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The skin (or muscles) around your child’s ribs and under her breastbone gets sucked in as she breathes.</li>
	<li>Your child’s nostrils flare.</li>
	<li>Your child is restless and has trouble feeding and drinking.</li>
	<li>Your child won’t lie down.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stridor</strong><br />
Stridor is a high-pitched, squeaky sound when your child breathes in. It’s usually a sign that there’s a blockage or narrowing in the windpipe.</p>

<p>Severe stridor is also occasionally caused by a condition called epiglottitis. It might also be caused by an inhaled foreign object.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about croup symptoms</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see your GP if you notice one or more of the following symptoms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your child is having trouble breathing.</li>
	<li>You can easily hear your child’s noisy breathing, even when he’s resting quietly.</li>
	<li>Your child’s breastbone sucks in when she breathes in.</li>
	<li>Your child has trouble swallowing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s always a good idea for your child to see the doctor if you have any worries about his breathing.</p>

<p>If your child’s lips go blue, or if your child looks very sick and becomes pale and drowsy, seek medical attention immediately by asking for an ambulance. Severe croup requires emergency medical attention and treatment and close observation in hospital.</p>

<h2>Tests for croup</h2>

<p>Your doctor will diagnose croup after taking your child’s history and examining your child.</p>

<h2>Treatment for croup</h2>

<p>Most children with croup don’t need treatment. You can manage the symptoms in exactly the same way as for a cold.</p>

<p>It’s important to try and keep your child calm, because your child can have more trouble breathing if she’s upset, frightened or stressed.</p>

<p>Croup is most commonly caused by a virus, so antibiotics won’t work. Antibiotics treat bacterial infections only.</p>

<p><strong>Steam therapy, including the use of vaporisors, doesn’t help to treat croup and is no longer recommended.</strong></p>

<p>Your child might need a short course of oral prednisolone or dexamethasone (steroids) if he has more severe symptoms. This treatment can reduce your child’s symptoms quickly by helping to reduce the swelling in his windpipe. </p>

<p>A few children with croup need to go to hospital for observation, to make sure that their windpipes don’t get blocked. While in hospital, your child might initially receive adrenaline in the form of mist (nebulised adrenaline). This reduces the swelling in the windpipe very quickly while the steroids work.</p>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

1246,Colds,"Colds are very common in children, especially in winter. Cold symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and ears, cough and headache. There’s no treatment that can make colds go away more quickly. But paracetamol or ibuprofen, fluids and saline nose spray can help with symptoms. See your doctor if your child’s symptoms don’t improve, or if your child is very unwell. You can slow colds spreading if you wash hands and cover mouths when coughing.","<h2>Children and colds</h2>

<p>The average preschool child has at least six colds a year. Sometimes, especially in winter, it might seem that your child is sick for weeks at a time, barely getting over one cold before getting another one.</p>

<p>Young children get a lot of colds because they haven’t had a chance to build up immunity to the many viruses that cause colds. As your child grows older, he’ll gradually build up immunity and get fewer colds.</p>

<p>Colds are also called <strong>upper respiratory tract infections</strong>.</p>

<h2>Causes of colds</h2>

<p>Most colds are caused by viruses. In fact, there are over 200 types of virus that can cause colds.</p>

<p>The viruses that cause colds are spread by <strong>sneezing, coughing and hand contact</strong>.</p>

<h2>Cold symptoms</h2>

<p>Symptoms vary from child to child, and from illness to illness.</p>

<p>You might see one or more of the following:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>a stuffy or runny nose</li>
	<li>sneezing</li>
	<li>sore throat and ears</li>
	<li>cough</li>
	<li>headache</li>
	<li>red eyes</li>
	<li>swollen lymph glands</li>
	<li>occasionally fever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, your child will lose her appetite, and she might even feel sick or vomit. She might be miserable or irritable.</p>

<p>Cold symptoms usually last anywhere from a few days to a week or more. Your child will usually recover fully without any problems.</p>

<p>Very occasionally there are complications like ear infection, laryngitis or croup, or lower respiratory tract infections like bronchiolitis or pneumonia. These are relatively uncommon illnesses compared to the uncomplicated cold.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s hard to tell the symptoms of cold and flu apart. When people say they have the flu, they usually really have a cold. People with flu might have more muscle pain and chills and higher fevers.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about colds?</h2>

<p>Almost all colds get better by themselves.</p>

<p>But you should take your child to see the doctor if your child has one or more of the following symptoms. Your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>won’t drink fluids</li>
	<li>vomits frequently</li>
	<li>is unusually tired or sleepy</li>
	<li>has a fever that doesn’t improve in 48 hours</li>
	<li>has a cough that lasts more than two weeks</li>
	<li>has noisy breathing or wheezing.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should <strong>call an ambulance or go to a hospital emergency department</strong> if your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>complains of an intense headache</li>
	<li>is pale and sleepy</li>
	<li>is having increasing difficulty breathing, or is breathing faster or harder than normal</li>
	<li>is younger than three months old and has a fever</li>
	<li>has a rash that doesn’t disappear when you hold a glass pressed against the rash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also see your dctor if your child doesn’t seem better in 48 hours, or if you’re worried.</p>

<h2>Tests for colds</h2>

<p>Most children with colds don’t need any tests. Sometimes your doctor might do tests to rule out other conditions .</p>

<h2>Cold treatment</h2>

<p>There’s no cure for the common cold. There’s also no specific treatment that can make a cold go away more quickly. The best thing is to treat the symptoms.</p>

<p>Treatment starts with <strong>making sure your child is drinking enough</strong> so he doesn’t get dehydrated, especially if he has a fever. You might need to give your child smaller amounts of fluid, just more often. Here’s what to do:</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>other things you can do </strong>to ease your child’s symptoms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If your child has a fever and is in pain or discomfort, give him paracetamol in the recommended dose and frequency. You can also give ibuprofen to children aged over three months.</li>
	<li>Don’t pressure your child to eat. If your child isn’t hungry while she has a fever, that’s OK. Her appetite will come back as she starts to feel better.</li>
	<li>Try giving your child saline nasal drops, which might help ease a blocked nose.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to take things easy, but there’s no need for him to stay in bed. Let your child decide how active he wants to be.</li>
	<li>Note that there’s no need to stay away from dairy products – they don’t make extra mucus.</li>
</ul>

<p>These medications are<strong> not recommended for colds</strong> unless your doctor says otherwise:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Cough medicines and </strong><strong>Decongestants</strong> can cause side effects taht might be severe. </li>
	<li><strong>Antibiotics</strong>: colds are usually caused by viruses, so antibiotics won’t help and can even cause stomach upsets and diarrhoea.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Preventing colds</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Wash your hands with warm soapy water after sneezing, coughing and blowing noses, and before eating.</li>
	<li>Cough into your elbow to avoid getting germs on your hands.</li>
	<li>Don’t share drink bottles, cups and utensils with people who have colds.</li>
</ul>

1251,Sore throat,"Sore throats are often caused by viral infections, but can also be caused by bacterial infections.Take your child to the doctor if he has a sore throat and also has trouble breathing, is drooling, has a stiff neck or has a fever.The way you treat a sore throat depends on its cause.","<h2>Sore throat causes</h2>

<p>The most common cause of a sore throat is a <strong>viral infection</strong> like the common cold, flu or glandular fever.</p>

<p><strong>Bacterial infections</strong> are much less common. These infections include streptococcal infections and ear infections.</p>

<p>If your child’s tonsils are swollen and red, it’s possible that tonsillitis is causing the sore throat. Mouth ulcers can also cause a sore throat.</p>

<p>The medical name for a sore throat or a throat infection is pharyngitis.</p>

<h2>Sore throat symptoms</h2>

<p>If your child’s sore throat is caused by the common cold, she’s likely to have a runny nose, cough and possibly sore ears, along with a fever, tiredness and a poor appetite.</p>

<p>If the cause is flu, your child might also have aches and pains.</p>

<p>It’s more likely to be a <strong>streptococcal infection </strong>if your child is older than three years, and if he has swollen neck glands, swollen red tonsils sometimes with white spots, and a rash. He might also have a fever, stomach pain and vomiting. This kind of sore throat might not come with a runny nose and cough.</p>

<p>Glandular fever is a relatively common cause of sore throats in older children. If your child has glandular fever, she’ll probably also have large swollen lymph glands.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about a sore throat?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if your child has a sore throat and:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>has trouble breathing or swallowing</li>
	<li>is drooling more than usual</li>
	<li>complains of a stiff or swollen neck</li>
	<li>can’t fully open his mouth</li>
	<li>has a fever for no apparent reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also see the doctor if you’re not sure about your child’s symptoms, but you think she might have a throat infection.</p>

<h2>Sore throat treatment</h2>

<p>The way you treat a sore throat depends on its cause.</p>

<p>There’s no specific treatment for a <strong>sore throat caused by a virus</strong>. Antibiotics won’t help with viral infections.</p>

<p>All you can do for a sore throat caused by viral infection is <strong>treat the symptoms</strong> by:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>giving your child saline nose drops to help with a blocked nose</li>
	<li>giving your child paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses to help with pain</li>
	<li>getting your child to take frequent sips of fluid to help him stay hydrated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child’s sore throat is caused by a <strong>streptococcal infection</strong>, your doctor  will most likely take a swab from your child’s throat for analysis. The doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics (usually penicillin) to treat the infection.</p>

<p>If your child isn’t responding to simple pain relief like paracetamol, your GP might prescribe a short course of corticosteroids.</p>

<p>If children have a <strong>bacterial infection</strong> that’s causing pus to build up at the back of the throat, they might need to go into hospital. This condition needs treatment with antibiotics, and children probably also need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist.</p>",8711,2,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"796, 2081, 2086, 2091",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/sore-throat"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/sore-throat</a></p>",en,published

<p>Tonsillitis is when your child’s tonsils get inflamed.</p>

<p>Tonsillitis is usually caused by viruses like the common cold, flu or glandular fever.</p>

<p>Sometimes a bacterial infection can cause tonsillitis, but it’s often hard to tell the difference between viral and bacterial causes.</p>

<p>Bacterial causes include streptococcal infection (<em>Streptococcus A</em>). If left untreated, this kind of infection can cause complications like scarlet fever, and, occasionally, rheumatic fever and kidney damage (glomerulonephritis).</p>

<p>Children under three years don’t often get bacterial tonsillitis.</p>

<p>The tonsils are two pieces of tissue at the back of the mouth. You can often see them if your child ‘opens wide’ and you look into his mouth. The tonsils work as part of the immune system.</p>

<h2>Tonsillitis symptoms</h2>

<p>If your child has tonsillitis, she’ll complain of a <strong>sore throat. </strong>She might also have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>difficulty swallowing</li>
	<li>a fever</li>
	<li>swollen, tender glands in her neck</li>
	<li>a headache</li>
	<li>a runny nose and other cold symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the cause of the infection, your child could also have a rash.</p>

<p>Tonsillitis symptoms usually improve after a few days and go away within a week.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about tonsillitis?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see a doctor if your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>refuses to drink fluids</li>

	<li>has a stiff neck</li>
	<li>feels tightness in his jaw.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re worried about your child’s symptoms, also see a doctor.</p>

<h2>Tests for tonsillitis</h2>

<p>Your doctor might order a throat swab to check whether a virus or bacteria is causing the infection.</p>

<p>The doctor might also suggest a blood test, which can help look for glandular fever.</p>

<h2>Tonsillitis treatment</h2>

<p>If the infection is caused by a <strong>virus</strong>, your child won’t need antibiotics.</p>

<p>Antibiotics is rarely needrd for trearment of tonsillitis in children younger than 3 years.</p>

<p>Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics only if the doctor concluded that the infection is caused by <strong>bacteria</strong>.</p>

<p>Antibiotic treatment no later than 9 days from the appearance of symptoms will prevent rheumatic fever. </p>

<p>You can <strong>treat your child’s symptoms </strong>by giving your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>small, frequent sips of water to help your child stay hydrated</li>
	<li>paracetamol in recommended doses to help with the pain.</li>

<p>Tonsillectomy is when you have your tonsils taken out. <strong>Tonsillectomy isn’t a routine operation</strong>. The main reason for tonsillectomy is severe obstruction of air flow to the lungs by the enlraged tonsills mailny during night sleep (upper airway obstruction). Another reason for tonsillectomy is that the child has tonsillitis that keeps coming back. very often.

1266,Sinusitis,"Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses around the nose and forehead. Symptoms include mucus coming out of the nose, and pressure, pain or swelling around the eyes and nose.Take your child to the doctor if you think he has sinusitis. Antibiotics are the most common treatment. Paracetamol can help with pain, and saline nasal drops can help with congestion.","<h2>Causes of sinusitis</h2>

<p>Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses around the nose and forehead.</p>

<p>Sinusitis can be caused by an infection or allergy. In children, it’s most likely to be a viral infection, which can become a bacterial infection.</p>

<p>Children with a family history of allergy are more likely to develop sinusitis.</p>

<p>Sinusitis is more common in older children and adults than in babies and younger children.</p>

<p>The sinuses are the little spaces or hollows between the bones of your skull and face. They’re progressly develped after birth and  all connected up, and they’re also connected by small tubes to the passages inside your nose.</p>

<h2>Sinusitis symptoms</h2>

<p>If your child has sinusitis, she’ll have a prolonged (usually longer that 7 days duration) thick, green mucus coming out of her nose. There might be nasal fluid running down the back of her throat. This is called ‘post-nasal drip’. It might cause irritation and coughing.</p>

<p>Your child might feel <strong>pressure or congestion</strong> over the area of an infected sinus.</p>

<p>Pain and swelling are common symptoms too, especially under the eyes. Pain is usually worse on one side of the face.</p>

<p>Your child might also have a fever and bad breath.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about sinusitis?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should take your child to the doctor if your child has:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>prolonged symptoms of sinusitis</li>
	<li>fever, or is generally unwell with no apparent cause</li>
	<li>a cough</li>
	<li>neck stiffness and a headache</li>
	<li>eye swelling during or after a bad cold.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child has sinusitis for a long time, or keeps getting it, he needs to see the doctor.</p>

<h2>Tests for sinusitis</h2>

<p>Most children don’t usually need any tests to diagnose sinusitis.</p>

<p>In some cases your doctor might send your child for a CT scan of her face to see whether the condition is chronic or complicated.</p>

<h2>Sinusitis treatment</h2>

<p>In mild cases no specific treatment is needed. Normal saline nasal drops or washes can help with congestion.</p>

<p>Antibiotics (usually amoxycillin) are recommended when symptoms are severe or prolonged (more than a week).</p>

<p>Paracetamol or ibuprofen at recommended doses can help ease any pain from the sinusitis.</p>

<p>There’s no evidence to show that decongestant sprays, corticosteroids or antihistamines help with sinusitis.</p>",8926,2,"48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2116, 2121, 2126, 2131",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article:<a href=""//raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/sinusitis""> https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/sinusitis</a></p>",en,published
1271,Influenza,"Flu symptoms include runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever and muscle aches. You can treat flu symptoms at home with rest, fluids and paracetamol. See your doctor if your child’s symptoms don’t improve or if your child is very unwell. To prevent flu spread, wash hands, cover when coughing, and vavccinate your child when recommended.","<h2>About influenza or flu</h2>

<p>Influenza or flu is caused by a virus. There are many different types of influenza viruses. The most common are types A and B.</p>

<p>Influenza viruses keep changing. This is why you can get the flu many times.</p>

<p>Influenza happens most often during winter. Occasionally, the virus becomes more widespread and causes an ‘epidemic’. When an epidemic happens, more people than normal get the flu.</p>

<p>Flu is very contagious and can spread when people who have it cough and sneeze. The virus can also live on hands and objects that have been in contact with a sick person’s mouth or nose.</p>

<h2>Flu symptoms</h2>

<p>Flu symptoms include a runny nose, a sore throat, cough, fever, headache and muscle aches. Your child might be shivering and also feel very hot or very cold.</p>

<p>Flu might occasionally cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>

<p>Flu usually lasts 2-5 days, although the tiredness and cough my  last for several weeks.</p>

<p>Many people say they have the flu while they  really have a cold. It’s hard to tell the symptoms apart. People with flu might have more muscle pain and chills.</p>

<h2>Flu complications</h2>

<p>Flu is usually quite mild in children but can cause complications. These complications can sometimes be very serious.</p>

<p>The most common flu complication is pneumonia. A child with pneumonia will look unwell and might breathe faster and harder than normal.</p>

<p>Flu can be more serious in children with long-term (chronic) medical problems, pregnant women and other adults, especially old people.</p>

<p>For children with asthma, flu can trigger symptoms or a severe asthma attack. </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about flu?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the GP if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child can’t or won’t drink fluids</li>
	<li>your child vomits frequently</li>
	<li>your child doesn’t show some improvement within 48 hours</li>
	<li>you’re worried that your child is very unwell.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should call an ambulance or go to a hospital emergency department if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has an intense headache</li>
	<li>is pale and sleepy</li>
	<li>is breathing faster or harder than normal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Flu treatment</h2>

<p>In most cases there is no need for special cure for flu. In severe cases and with children with chronic diseases the doctor may use a special anti flu drug called oseltamivir or tamiflu to slow the progress of illness.</p>

<p>All you can do for flu is <strong>treat the symptoms</strong> and try to make your child more comfortable:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen as needed in recommended doses. This can help if your child is in pain or has a fever that’s making him uncomfortable.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to drink lots of fluids so that she doesn’t get dehydrated. Warm drinks can ease a sore throat and dry mouth.</li>
	<li>There is no need for for your childhim to stay in bed. Let your child decide how active he wants to be.</li>
	<li>Don’t force your child to eat. She probably won’t be hungry, but her appetite will improve as she starts to feel better.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should <strong>avoid</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cough medicines – your child is coughing because his windpipe is irritated or has a lot of mucus, and cough medicines won’t help with either of these issues</li>
	<li>decongestants solutions have side effects like rapid heart rate, jitteriness and insomnia, and can’t help with flu</li>
	<li>antibiotics – flu is caused by a virus, so antibiotics won’t help and can even cause stomach upsets and diarrhoea.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s <strong>no need to stay away from dairy products</strong> – they don’t make extra mucus.</p>

<p>Don’t give your child or teenager aspirin or medications containing aspirin (acetyl salicylic acid). Aspirin can make your child susceptible to Reye’s syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness.</p>

<h2> Flu prevention</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid catching the flu is to <strong>wash your hands regularly</strong> with warm soapy water. Also try to keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Encourage family members to cover their mouths with a tissue, sleeve or elbow when coughing. Also encourage everyone to wash their hands after coughing and sneezing.</p>

<p>To minimise the chance of spreading your child’s flu to other people, <strong>keep your child away from child care, preschool or school </strong>while she’s sick.</p>

<h2>Flu immunisation</h2>

<p>Flu immunisation is safe and reduces the chance your child will get sick with flu, and it’s <strong>recommended that all children over six months be immunised against flu every year</strong>.</p>

1276,Pneumonia,"Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. If your child has pneumonia, you’re likely to notice changes in his breathing, as well as symptoms including fever, a moist cough, increased irritability and unusual tiredness.","<h2>Causes of pneumonia</h2>

<p>Pneumonia can be caused by a virus or more rarely a bacteria. The infection disturbs the lungs from working properly.</p>

<p>The main job of the lungs is to move oxygen from the air into the bloodstream. When they’re infected, the lungs can’t do their job as well as normal.</p>

<h2>Pneumonia in children: symptoms</h2>

<p>If your child has pneumonia, she:</p>

<ul>
	<li>will have a moist cough</li>
	<li>will have a high fever</li>
	<li>might be short of breath or have difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>might complain of sharp chest pains when she breathes deeply or coughs</li>
	<li>might have a tummy ache and might vomit</li>
	<li>might be irritable or tired.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most children also lose their appetite and might not want to drink. A younger baby might just look very ill and breathe rapidly, without showing any of the other symptoms above.</p>

<p>Young babies and children with severe pneumonia are at risk of dehydration.</p>

<h2>When to see your doctor about pneumonia symptoms</h2>

<p>You should take your child to see your GP if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child has a cough and a high fever</li>
	<li>your child has difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>your child is vomiting and not able to drink much</li>
	<li>your young baby is listless and breathing rapidly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Call an ambulance immediately if your child’s lips look blue.</p>

<h2>Tests for pneumonia</h2>

<p>The doctor can say whether your child has pneumonia by asking you questions about your child’s symptoms and by examining him.</p>

<p>Your doctor might send your child for a chest X-ray to check that your child definitely has pneumonia. Blood tests can sometimes help doctors to work out whether your child’s pneumonia is caused by a virus or bacteria.</p>

<h2>Pneumonia treatment</h2>

<p>You can treat most children with pneumonia at home:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>If your breastfed child is younger than six months</strong>, offer extra breastfeeds.</li>
	<li><strong>If your formula-fed child is younger than six months</strong>, offer her usual amount of formula. You might need to feed her smaller amounts more frequently if she’s unwell.</li>
	<li><strong>If your child is older than six months</strong>, keep breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. You can also offer your child clear fluids, like water. If your child isn’t hungry while he has a fever, that’s OK.</li>
	<li>Give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen according to directions if she has a fever.</li>
	<li>Ensure that your child gets as much rest as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child’s pneumonia is caused by bacteria, the doctor might prescribe antibiotics, which your child will need to take for a week or so. Antibiotics don’t work for pneumonia caused by a virus. Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between viral and bacterial pneumonia.</p>

<p>Smoke can make pneumonia worse, so keep your home smoke free.</p>

<p>If your child is very ill, or is less than one year old, he’ll probably need to go to hospital for special treatment. In hospital, your child will have antibiotics through a drip (intravenously) if the pneumonia is bacterial. Some children also need oxygen to ease their breathing. Your child might also get extra fluids through a drip.</p>

<p><strong>Recovery is usually quick and complete</strong> once treatment starts.</p>",8891,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,2146,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/pneumonia"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/pneumonia</a></p>",en,published
1281,Cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic condition that affects children’s lungs, digestive system, sweat glands and fertility. Specialised treatment can improve quality of life for children with cystic fibrosis.","<h2>About cystic fibrosis</h2>

<p>Children with cystic fibrosis have too much salt in their sweat. They also produce thick, sticky mucus that blocks their lungs, clogs their airways and is difficult to cough up. These blockages trap bacteria, which leads to lots of infections and lung damage.</p>

<p>Because of this, children with cystic fibrosis might cough a lot, have difficulty breathing and keep getting chest infections.</p>

<p>Also, the thick mucus caused by cystic fibrosis can clog the pancreas, blocking the flow of pancreatic juices into the gut to digest food. Because their food hasn’t been digested properly, children with cystic fibrosis can suffer from malnutrition, weight loss and diarrhoea.</p>

<p>Cystic fibrosis can lead to many long-term problems, like repeated chest infections, poor growth and diabetes.</p>

<p>Men with cystic fibrosis might be infertile, meaning they have trouble having children naturally.</p>

<p>Although many children with cystic fibrosis now survive well into adulthood, their condition means they might not live as long as other people.</p>

<h2>Causes of cystic fibrosis</h2>

<p>Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition caused by a defect or abnormality in the gene that controls how much salt and water go in and out of the body’s cells.</p>

<p>A baby might be born with cystic fibrosis if both parents are carriers of this gene. Most carriers of the gene are healthy without any symptoms.</p>

<p>Parents who have a child with cystic fibrosis have a one in four chance of having another child with the condition.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis</h2>

<p>If you have cystic fibrosis in your family, it’s a good idea to have genetic counselling and testing for cystic fibrosis. People who carry the gene can be identified with a simple blood test.</p>

<p>If you’re pregnant and there’s a possibility of your child inheriting the gene for cystic fibrosis, you can have further tests during pregnancy to work out whether your child is affected.</p>

<p>Your child will be tested for cystic fibrosis if he/she has symtoms that cast suspicion for this disorder such as recurrent lund and/or intestine problems. This is a simple test called a sweat test, which involves stimulating a small area of skin to produce sweat.</p>

<p>In some countries, some newborn may be screened for cystic fibrosis. This test  involves taking blood from your baby’s heel. If this test shows that your baby has a high level of an enzyme called immunoreactive trypsin (IRT), genetic testing for common gene mutations can show whether your child has cystic fibrosis. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Support and treatment for children with cystic fibrosis</h2>

<p>There’s no cure for cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p>If your child has cystic fibrosis, she’ll probably be treated in a specialist unit by a specialist multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis team.</p>

<p>Treatments for cystic fibrosis can be intensive and time consuming. Children need to go to the specialist unit regularly, and some children need to go to hospital often to manage chest infections.</p>

<p>Physiotherapy and various other treatments can support children’s health and improve the quality of life for children with the condition. Children usually need special treatments to clear their lungs two times a day. These treatments are usually administered by a parent or carer.</p>

<p>Several periods of daily antibiotics are usually necessary. Children with cystic fibrosis might also need nutritional supplements and steroids to treat lung infections. Doctors sometimes advise enzyme replacement therapy to help improve children’s nutrition, as well as a high-energy diet, with salt and vitamin supplements.</p>

<p>If your child has cystic fibrosis, you and your child might work with any or all of the following health professionals:</p>

<ul>
	<li>genetic counsellor</li>
	<li>paediatrician</li>
	<li>respiratory physician</li>
	<li>dietitian</li>
	<li>physiotherapist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Living with cystic fibrosis</h2>

<p>Staying active, exercising and having chest physiotherapy can help children with cystic fibrosis keep their lungs healthy.</p>

<p>A child with cystic fibrosis might miss a lot of school because of frequent hospital visits. If your child has cystic fibrosis, it’s important to let teachers know about his condition and to communicate with them regularly.</p>

<p>These days, with good treatment, people with cystic fibrosis can live productive lives well into middle age.</p>",8936,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2151, 2156",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cystic-fibrosis"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cystic-fibrosis</a></p>",en,published
1286,Blocked tear duct,"If your baby has a blocked tear duct, his eye will water constantly and he might have discharge from the eye when he wakes up. A blocked tear duct will usually fix itself. But see your doctor if your baby has symptoms of redness, swelling or green discharge around her eye. If the blocked tear duct hasn’t gone away by the time your baby turns one year old, see your doctor.","<h2>About a blocked tear duct</h2>

<p>Tears flow from the eye to the nose through narrow tubes called tear ducts.</p>

<p>A blocked tear duct usually happens when the membrane inside the lower end of the tear duct, near the nose, is slow to open after a baby is born. This creates a blockage. Although the blockage is usually present from birth, it might not be obvious until your baby is around one month old.</p>

<p>Blocked tear ducts are <strong>common</strong>. About 1 in 20 babies are born with a blockage in one or both of their tear ducts.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of a blocked tear duct</h2>

<p>If your baby has a blocked tear duct, his eye will be watering very often. When he wakes up, he might also have a discharge from his eye. You might hear these symptoms called ‘watering eyes’ and ‘sticky eyes’.</p>

<p>Other than the watering and sticky discharge, your baby’s eye is perfectly normal.</p>

<p>Rarely, the tissues around the tear duct get infected. If this happens, you might see redness spreading around your baby’s eyelid or green discharge from the eye.</p>

<h2>Does your baby need to see a doctor about a blocked tear duct?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to your doctor or child and family health nurse if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your baby’s eye or eyes look red</li>
	<li>your baby has a hard lump on the inner side of her eyelids or her eyelids are red and swollen</li>
	<li>you notice other symptoms like sensitivity to light or your baby constantly squeezing her eyes shut</li>
	<li>there’s a greenish discharge from your baby’s eye</li>
	<li>the tear duct is still blocked after your child has turned one year old.</li>

<p>A blocked tear duct usually gets better by itself, when the membrane inside the tear duct opens up. This usually happens by the time your baby turns one year old.</p>

<p>Your doctor might show you how to massage the inside of your baby’s eye to help empty the tear duct of the sticky discharge.</p>

<p>If your baby has an infection, your doctor might prescribe a course of eye drops containing antibiotics.</p>

<p>If the tear duct is still blocked after your child turns one year old, your doctor might refer you to a specialist. The specialist might recommend a procedure using a fine probe under general anaesthetic to open up the duct.</p>",8941,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/blocked-tear-duct"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/blocked-tear-duct</a></p>",en,published

<p>A stye is an infection of the eyelash follicle. Styes are usually caused by the bacteria <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p>

<p>Styes are a common eye complaint in children.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of a stye</h2>

<p>A stye looks like a small, red lump at the base of your child’s eyelash, usually on the lower lid.</p>

<p>It can cause swelling of the surrounding eyelid and be quite painful. The stye might also irritate the eye and make it watery.</p>

<p>Most styes get better within a few days.</p>

<p>Styes don’t generally cause any permanent damage to the eye or eyelid.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about a stye?</h2>

<p>Take your child to the doctor if the stye doesn’t go away within a few days of starting the stye treatment below.</p>

<p>You should also see the doctor if your child has a stye plus other general symptoms including fever, headache and loss of appetite, or if your child is feeling generally unwell.</p>

<p>Always seek medical advice if your child’s eyesight is affected.</p>

<h2>Stye treatment</h2>

<p>To help the pus come out of the stye, you can try warm compresses.</p>

<p>To <strong>make a warm compress</strong>, get a clean handtowel soaked in warm water and apply to the eyelid for two minutes at a time. Try to repeat the warm compresses at least three times a day. Gentle massage during the warm compress can help drain the stye – but don’t try to squeeze the stye.</p>

<p>Your GP might decide to perscribe antibiotic ointments and sometimes even oral antibiotics. Rarely the doctor might remove the lash with the infection. This might help the pus come out and speed up the healing process.</p>

<p>Milia are tiny white lumps that sometimes come up on babies’ faces soon after birth.</p>

<p>Milia are caused by a collection of dead cells (keratin) from the top layer of skin getting trapped just below the skin’s surface.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of milia</h2>

<p>Milia show up primarily on babies’ noses and cheeks, but they can appear anywhere on their faces. The lumps are usually less than 1 mm across, but they can measure up to 3 mm.</p>

1321,Deafness and hearing impairment,"Hearing impairment can happen at birth or start after birth. In everal countries all newborn undergo hearing screening for diagnosing hearing impairment or deafness in children. If your child is deaf or hard of hearing, he might use spoken language, sign language or a combination to talk. Depending on your child’s deafness, listening devices might help your child hear spoken language.","<h2>Hearing impairment, deafness, and hard of hearing: what these terms mean</h2>

<p>If your child is hard of hearing or deaf, it means that your child’s ears can’t do all or any of the things they should be able to do. For example, your child might have muffled hearing, or she might not be able to hear sounds coming from some directions, or she might have trouble hearing certain frequencies or sounds.</p>

<p>The terms ""deafness"" or ""hearing impairment"" might be used alternatively to describe this priblem.</p>

<h2>Types of deafness or hearing impairment</h2>

<p>Deafness or hearing impairment can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>happen at birth – this is <strong>congenital </strong>hearing impairment .</li>
	<li>start after birth – this is <strong>acquired </strong> hearing impairment.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two main types of hearing impairment – conductive and sensorineural.</p>

<p><strong>Conductive hearing impairment</strong> is when sounds from outside your child’s ear have trouble getting to the inside of the ear. Conductive hearing impairment is usually caused by middle ear fluid from middle ear infections, and is usually temporary.</p>

<p><strong>Sensorineural hearing impairment</strong> is when the nerves that are in charge of receiving sound and sorting out what it means don’t work properly. Sensorineural hearing impairment can be mild, moderate, severe or profound. Sensorineural hearing impairment usually lasts for life and can get worse over time.</p>

<p><strong>Mixed hearing loss</strong> is when a child has both conductive and sensorineural hearing impairment.</p>

<h2>Universal newborn hearing screening</h2>

<p><strong>What is hearing screening?</strong><br />
During screening, special equipment plays specific sounds into your baby’s ears and records the responses from your baby. </p>

<p>In most places, your baby will be screened in hospital, before you take your baby home.</p>

<h2>Signs of deafness or hearing impairment</h2>

<p>If your baby is deaf or hard of hearing, he won’t hear people speaking, which means <strong>he might not respond to your voice</strong> and other noises in the way you’d expect. As he gets older, you might notice that his speech and language aren’t developing like other children’s.</p>

<p>As a guide, <strong>here’s what you’d expect in a typically developing baby</strong>. If your child isn’t doing these things, it might be a good idea to talk to your doctor.</p>

<ul>
	<li>At <strong>0-4 months</strong>, your baby should startle at a loud noise, turn her head or move her eyes to locate the source of the sound. If she’s upset, she should calm down when she hears your voice.</li>
	<li>At <strong>4-8 months</strong>, your baby should notice sounds around him, smile when spoken to, babble and understand simple words like ‘bye-bye’.</li>
	<li>At <strong>8-14 months</strong>, your baby should respond to her name, say simple words like ‘mama’ and ‘dada’, copy simple sounds and use her voice to get attention from people nearby.</li>
	<li>At <strong>14-24 months</strong>, your child will start to develop vocabulary, understand and follow simple instructions, and put two words together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if everything seems OK but you still feel worried, you should see your doctor or nurse. After all, <strong>you know your baby best</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning to communicate: deaf children and children who are hard of hearing</h2>

<p>If your child is deaf or hard of hearing, he might use spoken language, sign language or a combination of sign and spoken language to talk.</p>

<p>Learning to communicate with spoken language for children with severe or profound deafness is really hard work, takes many years and doesn’t always succeed. The most important thing for your child’s development, and for your relationship with your child, is being able to communicate.</p>

<p><strong>Many families choose to teach their child to both speak and sign</strong>, regardless of whether the child can use spoken language. If this is your family’s choice, you and the rest of your family need to learn sign language too.</p>

<p>You can ask the health professionals who are caring for you and your child for more information and support to learn sign language.</p>

<h2>Listening devices for deaf children and children who are hard of hearing</h2>

<p>There are devices that can help your child hear spoken language. And when she can hear spoken language, your child can start learning to use language.</p>

<p>The right type of device for your child will depend on what type of hearing impairment he has and how severe it is. These devices, called <strong>amplification devices or assistive listening devices</strong>, include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>hearing aids</li>
	<li>bone conduction implants</li>
	<li>cochlear implants - a device inserted by surgery for people with severe sensorineural hearing lmpairment.</li>
	<li>personal frequency modulation (FM) systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child might use one device, or a <strong>combination of devices</strong>. Your child might also use these devices in combination with spoken language and sign language.</p>

<p>Most children with hearing impairment use assistive listening devices on both ears.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Early intervention services for deaf children and children who are hard of hearing</h2>

<p><strong>The earlier you find out your child has a hearing impairment, the sooner she can begin early intervention and have language to communicate with</strong>. It also means you and your family can get advice and support as soon as possible, giving your child the best start in life.</p>

<p>The team of professionals involved in supporting you and your child might include audiologists, speech pathologists and special education teachers. </p>

<p><strong>Don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions.</strong> </p>

<p>When you play, connect and communicate with your child throughout the day in ways that encourage her hearing and development, it can help her a lot. Children learn the most from the people who care for them and with whom they spend most of their time.</p>

<h2>Looking after yourself and your family</h2>

<p>Although it’s easy to get caught up in looking after your child, it’s important to look after your own wellbeing too. If you’re physically and mentally well, you’ll be better able to care for your child.</p>

<p>Talking to other parents can be a great way to get support. You can connect with other parents in similar situations by joining a face-to-face or an online support group.</p>

<p>If you have other children, these siblings of children with disability need to feel that they’re just as important to you – that you care about them and what they’re going through. It’s important to talk with them, spend time with them, and find the right support for them too.</p>",9086,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2211, 2216, 2221, 2226",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/hearing-impairment"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/hearing-impairment</a></p>",en,published
1326,Vision impairment,"Vision impairment can range from no vision – blindness – or very low vision to not being able to see particular colours. Babies might have vision impairment at birth. It can also happen later as a result of disease, injury or a medical condition. The way a child behaves or uses his eyes might be a sign of a problem with the way he sees. Severe vision loss or blindness can affect your child’s development and learning. Early intervention can help your child reach her full potential.","<h2>What is vision impairment?</h2>

<p>Low vision means having impaired vision that cannot be corrected by glasses or medications. The most seriuos situation of vision impairment is blindness.</p>

<p><strong>What is blindness?</strong></p>

<p> A child is considered legally blind if she can’t see at 6 m what a child with normal vision can see at 60 m, or if her field of vision is less than 20° in diameter (a person with normal vision can see 180°).</p>

<h2>Causes of vision impairment</h2>

<p>Babies might have vision impairment at birth. It can also happen later as a result of disease, injury or a medical condition.</p>

<p>The most common causes of vision impairment are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>neurological conditions that affect the parts of the brain that control sight (cortical vision impairment)</li>
	<li>genetic conditions like albinism and retinitis pigmentosa</li>
	<li>illnesses that happen to some very premature babies or babies that have particular problems during their birth</li>
	<li>conditions like paediatric glaucoma or cataracts and cancers like retinoblastoma</li>
	<li>infections with particular viruses during pregnancy – for example, rubella, cytomegalovirus, sexually transmitted infection, toxoplasmosis and so on</li>
	<li>structural problems with the eyes that limit vision – for example, microphthalmia or anophthalmia</li>
	<li>damage or injury to the eye, to the pathways connecting the eye to the brain, or to the visual centre of the brain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Early signs and symptoms of vision impairment</h2>

<p>Children who have vision impairment might have normal-looking eyes. Often, it will be something about a child’s behaviour or the way he uses his eyes that makes you think there might be a problem with the way he sees.</p>

<p>Most <strong>babies </strong>start to focus on faces and objects by 4-5 weeks of age. By about 6-8 weeks, most babies will start smiling at the familiar faces and things they see. But if a baby has a vision impairment, you might notice she has trouble doing this.</p>

<p>Other signs that a baby might have a problem with his vision are if his:</p>

<ul>
	<li>eyes move quickly from side to side (nystagmus), jerk or wander randomly</li>
	<li>eyes don’t follow your face or an object, or he doesn’t seem to make eye contact with family and friends</li>
	<li>eyes don’t react to bright light being turned on in the room</li>
	<li>pupils seem white or cloudy rather than black</li>
	<li>eyes don’t appear straight but turn towards the nose or drift outwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>An older<strong> child</strong> might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>hold things up close to her face</li>
	<li>say she is tired or rub her eyes a lot</li>
	<li>turn or tilt her head or cover one eye when looking at things up close</li>
	<li>get tired after looking at things up close – for example, reading, drawing or playing handheld games</li>
	<li>seem to see better during the day than at night</li>
	<li>seem to have crossed or turned eyes or a squint (lazy eye)</li>
	<li>seem clumsy – for example, she might knock things over or trip often.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Diagnosis of vision impairment</h2>

<p>Diagnosis of <a>vision impairment</a> is usually  done by the ophthalmologist..</p>

<h2>Effects of blindness</h2>

<p>Blindness can affect lots of areas such as :</p>

<ul>
	<li>communicating,</li>
	<li>playing and socialising with others</li>
	<li>talking – for example, the  baby might not point to objects, so that the people around him won’t name these objects.</li>
	<li>delay in ability to sit, walk etc..</li>
	<li>delay in abliy to read, write and to play with objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Early intervention services for children with vision impairment</h2>

<p> Early intervention with specialists in the field is very important and can help the child learn new skills and support  development and communication.</p>

1331,Microcephaly,"Microcephaly is a problem with the way the brain or nervous system grows. Children with microcephaly have smaller than usual heads and brains. Babies can be born with microcephaly, or it can develop in the early years of life. Children with microcephaly sometimes have other syndromes. Children with microcephaly often have intellectual disability, seizures or problems with muscle stiffness or balance. Early intervention can improve your child’s quality of life.","<h2>What is microcephaly?</h2>

<p>Microcephaly is a <strong>neurodevelopmental disorder</strong> – that is, a problem with the way the brain or nervous system grows.</p>

<p>Children with microcephaly have smaller than usual heads and brains. They also often have intellectual disability and neurological issues like seizures, problems with muscle stiffness and control, or problems with balance.</p>

<p>Babies can be born with microcephaly, or it can develop in the first few years of life. It can happen on its own, but it often comes with other neurodevelopmental syndromes like Down syndrome.</p>

<p>Microcephaly can be caused by genetic changes. Sometimes the gene changes that cause it are inherited from parents. Sometimes the gene changes happen for the first time in the child.</p>

<p>Particular viruses can cause microcephaly too. For example, infection with the Zika virus in pregnancy can cause microcephaly.</p>

<p>And if a pregnant woman comes into contact with certain toxic chemicals or uses lots of alcohol or drugs during pregnancy, this can also damage the fetus’s brain while it’s developing.</p>

<p>Microcephaly occurs in approximately 1 in 25 000 children.</p>

<h2>Signs and symptoms of microcephaly</h2>

<p><strong>Physical characteristics</strong><br />
Most babies born with microcephaly have heads that are smaller than usual and grow  below the typical growth curves.</p>

<p>Other physical characteristics might include poor growth in general and small stature.</p>

<p><strong>Cognitive signs</strong><br />
Children with microcephaly often have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>delayed development</li>
	<li>delayed speech</li>
	<li>intellectual disability</li>
	<li>difficulties with coordination and balance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behavioural signs</strong><br />
Children with microcephaly might have behaviour like hyperactivity, agitation and aggression.</p>

<p><strong>Medical concerns linked with microcephaly</strong><br />
Children with microcephaly can have other medical conditions including seizures.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis and testing for microcephaly</h2>

<p>Sometimes health professionals can diagnose microcephaly while a baby is still in the womb. They do this using an ultrasound scan. An ultrasound diagnosis usually happens in the third trimester because smaller than normal head size isn’t obvious earlier in pregnancy.</p>

<p>After birth, or if a baby develops microcephaly later, health professionals diagnose it by measuring the baby’s head and monitoring it as he grows. They might also use X-rays and MRI scans.</p>

<h2>Early intervention services for children with microcephaly</h2>

<p>There’s no cure for microcephaly. But if your child has microcephaly, early childhood intervention services can help improve her quality of life.</p>

<p>Some children with microcephaly won’t need any treatment other than routine appointments to measure head size. Other children might have serious speech and learning difficulties. Some might need medication for seizures.</p>

<p>If your child has microcephaly, he might see several health professionals as part of early intervention. These professionals include paediatricians, speech pathologists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</p>

<p>Together, you and your team can choose the treatment and therapy options that will best support your child.</p>

<h2>Looking after yourself and your family</h2>

<p>If your child has microcephaly, it’s easy to get caught up in looking after her. But it’s important to look after your own wellbeing too. If you’re physically and mentally well, you’ll be better able to care for your child.</p>

<p>If you need support, a good place to start is with your doctor and genetic counsellor. You can also get support from welfare organisations.</p>

<p>Talking to other parents can also be a great way to get support. You can connect with other parents in similar situations by joining a face-to-face or an online support group.</p>

1336,Hepatitis C,"Hepatitis C is rare in children.Hepatitis C symptoms include tiredness, appetite loss, nausea and stomach pain.Most children with hepatitis C need treatment. There are some medications that might be considered for older children.Hepatitis C spreads through blood-to-blood contact.","<h2>Hepatitis C causes</h2>

<p>Hepatitis C is caused by a virus. If you get infected with this virus, the virus travels through your blood to your liver, where it causes inflammation.</p>

<h2>How hepatitis C spreads</h2>

<p>Hepatitis C spreads through <strong>blood-to-blood contact</strong> – that is, when people come into contact with the blood of someone who has the virus.</p>

<p>The most common way that children get hepatitis C is from mothers who pass the virus on to their babies during pregnancy or at birth.</p>

<p>There’s also a very small risk of hepatitis C infection from accidental contact with a discarded needle.</p>

<p>Hepatitis C is rare in children. It’s most common among adults who inject drugs and share contaminated needles.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis C symptoms</h2>

<p>Most children infected with hepatitis C won’t have symptoms.</p>

<p>Older children and teenagers might have mild symptoms like tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and pain in the top right area of their stomachs, where the liver is.</p>

<p>Very rarely, children can get a severe hepatitis C infection. </p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about hepatitis C?</h2>

<p>You should take your child to the doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>develops yellow skin or eyes – this is called jaundice</li>
	<li>has very dark brown urine</li>
	<li>has stomach pain that continues longer than a few days</li>
	<li>comes into contact with a discarded needle.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should also speak to your doctor if you think you might have been exposed to hepatitis C during your pregnancy.</p>

<h2>Tests for hepatitis C</h2>

<p>If the doctor thinks that your child’s symptoms might be caused by hepatitis C or that your child might have been exposed to hepatitis C, your child will need blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<h2>Treatment for hepatitis C</h2>

<p>Some children with hepatitis C get over the infection without any treatment. This could take weeks or months. But most children with hepatitis C go on to have chronic hepatitis C. This puts them at risk of liver scarring, liver failure (cirrhosis) and liver cancer when they’re older.</p>

<p>Effective and safe anti-viral medications are now available to treat chronic hepatitis C in adults. These medications can cure the infection in most people. Health professionals might consider prescribing them for some older children.</p>

<p>Your doctor might refer you to a specialist with experience in treating hepatitis C.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis C prevention</h2>

<p>There is no immunisation for hepatitis C.</p>

<h2>What is cerebral palsy?</h2>

<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disability that affects a child’s ability to control his muscles.</p>

<p>Children with cerebral palsy can have problems like muscle weakness, stiffness, awkwardness, slowness and shakiness. They might also have difficulties with balance.</p>

<h2>Causes of cerebral palsy</h2>

<p>Cerebral palsy can happen when there is brain damage or there are problems with brain development in the parts of the brain that control muscle movements.</p>

<p>Damage or problems with brain development can happen when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a child’s brain doesn’t develop properly during pregnancy</li>
	<li>a baby is born prematurely and the brain isn’t fully developed</li>
	<li>a mother is exposed to certain viruses during pregnancy</li>
	<li>a baby doesn’t get enough oxygen during birth</li>
	<li>a baby has a stroke during pregnancy or after birth</li>
	<li>a baby gets a severe brain infection shortly after birth</li>
	<li>a child experiences certain kinds of injuries during the early years of life – for example, a serious motor vehicle accident.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>Types of cerebral palsy</h2>

<p>There are three different types of cerebral palsy.</p>

<p><strong>Spastic cerebral palsy</strong><br />
Children with this type of cerebral palsy have stiff, tight muscles. </p>

<p><strong>Dyskinetic cerebral palsy</strong><br />
Children with this type have a lot of involuntary twisting and repetitive movements. These can be anywhere in the body and are worse when children do things like reach for a cup or talk. These movements might make it very difficult for children to sit, stand, reach or grasp.</p>

<p><strong>Ataxic cerebral palsy</strong><br />
Children with this type have shaky and unsteady movements or tremors. They also have problems with balance and might walk with their feet wide apart to help balance.</p>

<p>Most children with cerebral palsy actually have a <strong>combination of two or more of these types</strong> of cerebral palsy.</p>

<h2>Symptoms and effects of cerebral palsy</h2>

<p>Every child with cerebral palsy has a <strong>different combination of symptoms</strong>.</p>

<p>Some children have quite mild symptoms, and can walk well and communicate well. Children with severe cerebral palsy need to use a wheelchair at least some of the time. About one-third of children with cerebral palsy need extra help to get around, and one-quarter can't talk.</p>

<p>The <strong>effects of cerebral palsy</strong> can be different in different children.</p>

<p><strong>Babies</strong><br />
Babies with cerebral palsy might have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>problems with feeding</li>
	<li>slow or delayed development </li>
	<li>unequal movements across their bodies – for example, they might take no notice of one hand or show a preference for one hand early on</li>
	<li>poor muscle control</li>
	<li>low muscle tone</li>
	<li>muscle spasms or stiffness when you try to move their joints.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brain damage in babies with cerebral palsy won’t get worse. But it can get harder for their bodies to manage extra challenges as they grow up. For example, it might be hard for them to keep walking once they get taller during growth spurts in the teenage years.</p>

<p><strong>Children</strong><br />
The most common problems for children with cerebral palsy are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>movement</li>
	<li>feeding</li>
	<li>pain</li>
	<li>sleep</li>
	<li>communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other problems can include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>intellectual disability or learning disabilities in about 45% of children</li>
	<li>behaviour difficulties</li>
	<li>vision impairment</li>
	<li>hearing impairment.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other health issues</strong><br />
Many children with cerebral palsy also experience other health issues including gastro-oesophageal reflux, constipation, epilepsy, orthopaedic problems and recurrent chest infections.</p>

<p>You know your child best. If you’re worried about how your baby or child is developing, trust your instincts and talk to your child doctor or nurse about your concerns.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis and tests for cerebral palsy</h2>

<p>Cerebral palsy is a complex disability and getting a clear diagnosis before 12 months isn’t always easy. </p>

<p>To diagnose cerebral palsy, a doctor will take a complete medical history and thoroughly examine your child, and your child might also need to see a few specialists and have several tests to rule out other conditions.</p>

<h2>Early intervention services for children with cerebral palsy</h2>

<p>Although there’s no cure for cerebral palsy, early intervention can treat your child's symptoms, improve his outcomes and help him reach his full potential.</p>

<p>Through early intervention services, you can work with health professionals to choose the treatment and intervention options that will suit your child best.</p>

<p>The team of professionals involved in supporting you and your child might include paediatricians, physiotherapists, speech pathologists, occupational therapists, special education teachers and also welfare worker to innstruct for possible financial help.</p>

<h2>Looking after yourself and your family</h2>

<p>Although it’s normal to get caught up in looking after your child, it’s important to look after your own wellbeing too. If you’re physically and mentally well, you’ll be better able to care for your child.</p>

<p>Talking to other parents can be a great way to get support. You can connect with other parents in similar situations by joining a face-to-face or an online support group.</p>

<p>If you have other children, these siblings of children with disability need to feel that they’re just as important to you – that you care about them and what they’re going through. It’s important to talk with them, spend time with them, and find the right support for them too.</p>",5261,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2301, 501",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cerebral-palsy"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/cerebral-palsy</a></p>",en,published
1351,Down syndrome,"Down syndrome is a common genetic condition that causes intellectual disability and other physical and learning challenges. Screening and diagnostic tests during pregnancy can tell you about your child’s chance of having Down syndrome. Down syndrome can also be diagnosed at birth.Early intervention, regular health checks and family support can help children with Down syndrome grow up to lead happy, healthy and productive lives.","<h2>What is Down syndrome?</h2>

<p>Down syndrome is a <strong>genetic condition</strong>. It’s also called Trisomy 21.</p>

<p>Down syndrome happens when a child’s cells end up with 47 chromosomes in them instead of the usual 46. It affects about 1 in every 700-900 babies and causes a range of physical and developmental problems as well as intellectual disability.</p>

<p>Although we know how Down syndrome happens, we don’t know why. We do know it’s nobody’s fault. Often, the change to a baby’s cells happens at the moment when the baby is conceived. Down syndrome can affect all ethnic and cultural groups and children born to parents of all ages.</p>

<p>Most children born with Down syndrome grow up to lead happy, healthy and productive lives. Some children need only a little bit of help, and others need more support.</p>

<h2>Screening and diagnosing Down syndrome</h2>

<p>You can have <strong>tests during pregnancy</strong> to help you find out whether your baby has Down syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>Screening tests</strong> give you information about how likely it is that your baby has Down syndrome, but these tests don’t give you a definite answer. Examples of screening tests include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT): you give a small amount of blood, which is tested for parts of your baby’s DNA</li>
	<li>first trimester combined screening test: this combines a blood test from you with a measurement from your 12-week ultrasound scan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the results of screening tests, you might want to have diagnostic testing. Diagnostic testing can tell you definitely whether your baby has Down syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnostic tests</strong> include chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Both of these tests are very accurate, but they also have some risks. And even if the tests say your child definitely has Down syndrome, they can’t tell you how the condition will affect your child in life. You can talk to your doctor or midwife to get more information about these tests.</p>

<p>Down syndrome <strong>can also be diagnosed at birth </strong>because there are key physical features that your doctor can see. If the doctor thinks your baby has Down syndrome, the doctor will confirm this by giving your baby a blood test.</p>

<p>You can read more about antenatal tests for chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome.</p>

<h2>Common features of Down syndrome</h2>

<p>Children with Down syndrome share physical features with other children with Down syndrome, but they also look like their own family members.</p>

<p>Down syndrome is different for everyone affected, but all people with Down syndrome have some intellectual disability. It can range from quite mild to more severe.</p>

<p>For children with Down syndrome, intellectual disability means <strong>some delay in development and some learning difficulty</strong>.</p>

<p>People with Down syndrome might also have a range of medical and health conditions, so it’s important to have your child’s health checked regularly by health professionals.</p>

<h2>Supporting your child with Down syndrome</h2>

<p>You can expect that the key milestones – like walking, talking and crawling – will probably be slower to come for your child with Down syndrome.</p>

<p>But as with any other child, <strong>your love and stimulation</strong> are the most important influences on your child's development. Children learn the most from the people who care for them and with whom they spend most of their time, so everyday play and communication can help your child a lot.</p>

<p>With family and community support, your child with Down syndrome can grow up to be just like anyone else – living in the community, holding down a job and having good relationships with friends and family.</p>

<p>Regular health and development checks will help to spot any issues for your child. Talking to health professionals like your child and family health nurse or GP is also a good way to work out what help you and your child need.</p>

<h2>Early intervention services for children with Down syndrome</h2>

<p>Although there’s no cure for Down syndrome, early intervention can make a difference. Through early intervention services, you can work with health professionals to choose therapy options to treat your child’s symptoms, support your child, improve outcomes for your child and help him reach his full potential.</p>

<p>The team of professionals involved in supporting you and your child might include paediatricians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, special education teachers and psychologists.</p>

<h2>Looking after yourself and your family</h2>

<p>Being told that your unborn or new baby has Down syndrome can be a big shock for you and your family and friends. If you need information and support from local health and welfare services.</p>

<p>Talking to other parents can also be a great way to get support for yourself. You can connect with other parents in similar situations by joining a face-to-face or an online support group.</p>

<p>If you have other children, these siblings of children with disability need to feel that they’re just as important to you – that you care about them and what they’re going through. It’s important to talk with them, spend time with them, and find the right support for them too.</p>",5256,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2306, 2316, 2321, 2326, 2331",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/down-syndrome"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/down-syndrome</a></p>",en,published
1356,About baby development and developmental milestones,"All babies grow and reach development milestones at different times. Development milestones relate to your baby’s ability to move, see, hear, communicate and interact with others. If you are worried about your baby’s development, talk to your doctor or nurse.","<h2>Baby development: how it happens</h2>

<p>Baby development in the first 12 months is amazing because so much happens. Most healthy babies develop new skills in a completely natural and continually surprising way.</p>

<p>Babies all grow and develop at very different rates – and they do not always do what the parenting textbooks say they will be doing!</p>

<p>If your baby is eating and sleeping well and seems mostly happy when she is awake, she is likely to be developing well. You know your baby best – if you think she is okay, she probably is. But if you are worried about her development, trust your instincts and talk to your doctor or nurse.</p>

<h2>Baby developmental milestones</h2>

<p>Developmental achievements are called ‘milestones’. Growth and development <strong>milestones are a useful guide for tracking your baby’s development</strong>.</p>

<p>Developmental milestones are grouped under headings according to the parts of the body they refer to:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Large body movements</strong> (gross motor skills) involve the coordination and control of large muscles, and skills like walking, sitting and running.</li>
	<li><strong>Small body movements</strong> (fine motor skills) involve the coordination and control of small muscles, and skills like holding a rattle and picking up crumbs.</li>
	<li><strong>Vision</strong> is the ability to see near and far, and to understand what you see.</li>
	<li><strong>Hearing</strong> is the ability to hear, listen to and interpret sounds.</li>
	<li><strong>Speech</strong> <strong>and language </strong>is the ability to produce and understand sounds that form words.</li>
	<li><strong>Social behaviour</strong> and understanding is the ability to learn and interact with others. It includes skills for play and connecting and communicating.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developmental delay</h2>

<p>Some babies have delays in their development, but it is hard to predict whether these delays are short term or permanent. Permanent delays do not happen often.</p>

<p>Premature birth or other illness and injury that affect brain development are some of the things that might cause developmental delays.</p>

<p>Babies’ development can also suffer because of their environment. For example, baby development can be affected if babies don’t have warm, responsive and reliable relationships with those around them, if they do not have predictable routines that help them feel safe, or if their parents abuse alcohol and other drugs or are involved in family violence.</p>

<h2>Things to watch out for in baby development</h2>

<p>Every baby develops differently, and there is a big range of ‘normal’.</p>

<p>Try not to compare your baby with others, because this can lead you to worry when you do not need to. Comparing your baby to others can even have a negative impact on your relationship with your child.</p>

<p>But as a general guide, if you are seeing delays in a few different areas over several months, it is a good idea to seek advice from a health professional. Here are some signs to look out for.</p>

<p><strong>Physical signs</strong><br />
Your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>does not seem to see things or hear properly</li>
	<li>does not move or use both arms and/or legs</li>
	<li>cannot hold his head up by the time he has reached 3-4 months</li>
	<li>is not sitting well by 10 months</li>
	<li>does not want to stand up, even if you support him, by 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behaviour signs</strong><br />
Your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is persistently crying for more than three hours a day, especially after 3-4 months (it is normal for babies to cry for about two hours a day, with crying peaking at 6-8 weeks)</li>
	<li>has an unusual cry – for example, a high-pitched squeal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Social, emotional and communication signs</strong><br />
Your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>does not look at you</li>
	<li>is not interested in what is going on around her</li>
	<li>does not consistently respond to sounds</li>
	<li>is not babbling by 9 months or is using fewer than five words at 18 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is normal for babies to do things like waving, clapping or making a particular sound, then suddenly stop. These things usually reappear. It might be that your baby is fascinated by learning a new task. But if your baby shows signs of forgetting skills over several months or if you are concerned, you should talk to your doctor or nurse.</p>",5231,6,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"2336, 2341, 2346, 2351, 2356, 2361, 2366, 2371, 2376, 2381",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/development/baby-development"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/development/baby-development</a></p>",en,published
1451,Helping siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder,"Being the sibling of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be both a challenging and enriching experience. Here are some ideas for looking after typically developing siblings of children with ASD, ensuring they get your time and attention, and helping them understand more about ASD.","<h2>Parenting siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder</h2>

<p>Having a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can make it difficult to find time for the needs of your other children. You might sometimes feel guilty or anxious about how you are doing.</p>

<p>But <strong>do not be too hard on yourself</strong> – there are some simple things you can do every day to nurture your other children.</p>

<h2>Explaining autism spectrum disorder to siblings</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to start explaining autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to your typically developing children as soon as you think they can understand, or as soon as they are old enough to notice their brother or sister is behaving differently from other children. This helps children adjust to their sibling’s disability, and avoids mistaken ideas about ASD.</p>

<p>As children get older and better able to understand, you will find they need more information and will ask more complicated questions about ASD.</p>

<p><strong>How to explain ASD</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Find out what your children know already. Keep answers to any questions simple. Ask questions about your children’s feelings. Be prepared to explain things several times.</li>
	<li>Use language and ideas that suit your children’s ages and levels of understanding. Use basic terms or simple descriptions of ASD characteristics.</li>
	<li>It is okay to tell very young children that their sibling ‘cannot do something’ because their sibling has not learned how to or ‘does not understand’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What children know about ASD</strong><br />
Even when children know a bit about ASD in general, they often do not know much about how ASD affects their siblings in particular.</p>

<p>Children of different ages understand ASD in different ways. A five-year-old might see ASD as the reason why a sibling cannot write. A 17-year-old is more likely to see ASD as an obstacle to a sibling having a ‘normal life’.</p>

<p>Children sometimes have <strong>mistaken ideas</strong> about their sibling’s ASD. They might think ASD is something you can ‘catch’ like a cold. Younger children might even think that they have caused their sibling’s ASD through bad behaviour or bad thoughts. You can help them with these thoughts by talking with them and explaining things.</p>

<h2>Effects of autism spectrum disorder on siblings</h2>

<p>Generally, <strong>siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) adjust well</strong>. Often, siblings of children with disability are more caring, compassionate, independent and tolerant.</p>

<p>But your typically developing children can experience a range of difficult or negative feelings too. For example, at different times they might feel:</p>

<ul>
	<li>jealous of the amount of time that you are spending with their sibling</li>
	<li>discouraged because their sibling  does not seem to want to play with them</li>
	<li>angry if they think you have different expectations of them and their sibling – for example, they might feel you let  their sibling get out of household chores or get away with aggressive behaviour</li>
	<li>protective of their sibling and angry if others make fun</li>
	<li>embarrassed by people staring or by unwanted attention during family outings</li>
	<li>guilty for having negative feelings, like embarrassment or anger, towards their sibling</li>
	<li>concerned that the added stress is affecting your wellbeing and your relationship with your partner – for example, some children might worry that you and your partner might separate or divorce</li>
	<li>concerned or resentful about any future roles as carers for their sibling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helping siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder</h2>

<p>Just like your child with ASD, your other children need your attention. Here are some ways you can give your typically developing children everyday warmth and positive attention, help them feel special and encourage positive relationships among all your children.</p>

<p><strong>Making special time for siblings</strong><br />
Siblings of children with ASD often do not seek attention or talk about their own problems. To overcome this, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>set aside regular daily times for your children – it might be a bedtime story, or 10 minutes together at the end of each day when you tell your children three positive things they did in the day</li>
	<li>take a few minutes to listen when your children want to tell you something – this can help if you cannot set aside regular time each day</li>
	<li>make time for special activities with your children, without their sibling with ASD – this could be taking your children to the swimming pool or a movie</li>
	<li>use a trusted babysitter or respite carer to look after your child with ASD for a day or weekend – this way you can spend a longer period with your other children.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might feel that it is unfair to spend more time with your child with ASD than your other children. But the important thing is to <strong>make your other children feel special</strong> during their time with you, even if it is only for a few minutes a day, like when you pick them up from school, or at bedtime.</p>

<p>If your other children feel that they are also special to you, they will come to understand the situation more and more as they get older. They will be less likely to feel resentful towards their sibling.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraging closer relationships</strong><br />
Siblings of children with ASD generally feel positive about their brothers or sisters, but often their relationships are not as close as they could be. This might be because of the difficulties children with ASD often have with social communication.</p>

<p>One way to encourage closer relationships among your children is to look for ways that they can all play, have fun and interact together. For example, many young children with ASD love blowing bubbles and playing with trains – these are activities their brothers and sisters can enjoy too.</p>

<p><strong>Trying to be fair </strong>It is important for your children to feel they’re all treated fairly:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where possible, make family rules that are fair for all your children.</li>
	<li>Use strategies to encourage good behaviour in all your children.</li>
	<li>Try not to accept aggressive or hurtful behaviour from your child with ASD if you will not accept it from your other children.</li>
</ul>

<p>It can be tempting to ignore behaviour like hitting or throwing in your child with ASD because this child ‘doesn’t understand’, or it’s just ‘too hard’. But your child’s siblings could see this as unfair, and feel resentful or  upset as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up family roles and responsibilities</strong><br />
All your children can contribute to your family life. Helping around your home helps everyone pull together as a family and teaches all children important independence skills. It is just a matter of <strong>working out roles and responsibilities that are appropriate</strong> for your children’s different ages and abilities.</p>

<p>Your typically developing children can do household tasks and chores like making their beds, washing dishes, folding the clothes and so on. Your child with ASD can take on more responsibilities with age too. For example, this child might be able to get placemats out and put them on the dinner table.</p>

<p>It might be tempting to rely on your other children or expect them to take on extra responsibilities. It is important to be fair, though, and to remember that your other children need time just to be children.</p>

<p><strong>Managing negative feelings</strong><br />
While they are learning and adjusting to their sibling’s ASD, your other children might have negative feelings about how they’re being treated. They might feel hurt, resentful, anxious or sad.</p>

<p>Here are some ways to help them with these feelings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be aware of your children’s feelings and acknowledge them – for example, if your child says, ‘I hate playing with Siraj, he takes my toys,’ you could say ‘That must be really frustrating’.</li>
	<li>Communicate with your children about their feelings in a non-judgmental way – for example, you might say ‘I’m not angry with you. Can you tell me what happened and how that made you feel?’</li>
	<li>Work together to come up with some positive outlets for your children’s feelings.  For example, your children might like to draw or paint to express their feelings.</li>
	<li>Share your own feelings to help your typically developing children understand that their feelings are normal – for example, you might say that you feel embarrassed sometimes too.</li>
	<li>Talk with another family member or friend about what is happening. Speaking with another grown-up can ease your mind and help you find solutions.</li>
	<li>If you need help managing siblings or their feelings, seek assistance from a professional, like your doctor, a child psychologist or a counsellor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Encouraging a support network outside your family</h2>

<p>At times, your other children might feel overwhelmed by  family life, especially if they have a sibling with severe behaviour difficulties. Friendships outside the family can help your children feel they are more than just the  siblings of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p>

<p>Joining a sibling support group can help them to realise they are not alone and  understand that what they are feeling is normal. Counselling can also be a good idea, if children are having a hard time coping.</p>

<p><strong>Support groups</strong><br />
Joining an ASD family support group is a great way to meet and form friendships with other people in  similar situations to yours.  It can also give your typically developing children the opportunity to get to know other siblings of children with ASD.</p>",5436,6,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"506, 2501, 2506, 2276, 2291",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/family-life/siblings/siblings-asd"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/family-life/siblings/siblings-asd</a></p>",en,published
1456,Supporting siblings of children with disability,"Typically developing children need to feel that they matter as much as their siblings with disability. You can support typically developing children by talking with them, spending time together and problem-solving together. You can help typically developing children to connect with people outside the family through sports clubs, extracurricular activities, time with friends, and support groups.","<h2>Supporting your typically developing child</h2>

<p>Typically developing children have a range of feelings about siblings with disability. These children also need to feel that they are just as important to you as your child with disability – that you care about them and what they are going through just as much.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for supporting typically developing children.</p>

<h2>Celebrate your typically developing child’s sibling relationship</h2>

<p>When you look out for the things your child enjoys doing with his brother or sister with disability, you can help your child focus on the positives.</p>

<p>For example, you might notice that your children smile and laugh when they play cars together. You could say, ‘William, you’re smiling while you play cars with your brother. It looks like that makes you happy’.</p>

<h2>Talk about feelings with your typically developing child</h2>

<p>When you encourage your child to share her thoughts and feelings, and when you listen without judgment or blame, you send the message that it is okay for your child to feel the way she does. For example, ‘I understand you feel angry when your sister pulls your hair’.</p>

<p>You could also talk with your child about how his brother or sister with disability might think, feel and behave. For example, ‘I know your brother does not use words, but he loves it when you play with him’. This can help your child understand how his sibling with disability sees the world.</p>

<p><strong>Talking about your own feelings</strong><br />
When you talk about your own feelings about your child’s disability, you set a good example for all your children. It is okay to show your children that you have lots of different feelings about the situation too.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how you could talk about your feelings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘I felt happy when you helped your brother put on his hat.’</li>
	<li>‘Aigul has fallen over and hurt herself. I feel sad about that.’</li>
	<li>‘I get annoyed when people ask me lots of questions about your sister, but I also feel glad that they are interested. Sometimes I tell them I don’t want to talk about it.’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spend time with your typically developing child</h2>

<p>Juggling the demands and needs of all family members can be a challenge.</p>

<p>Your typically developing child might notice if you are spending more time with his sibling – for example, at professional appointments. Although you cannot help this, you can talk to your child about his feelings. You might say, ‘I’ve been at the doctors with your sister a lot this week. I wonder whether you are feeling a bit frustrated about that?’</p>

<p>You can get your child to choose some activities that you can do together. For example, ‘I’m looking forward to spending time with you after school today. I thought we could do some drawing. Or is there something you really want to do?’</p>

<p>You can help your typically developing child build self-confidence by talking with him about what he’s good at and what he enjoys doing. This will help your child feel like he matters and is an important part of the family, even when his sibling needs extra attention.</p>

<h2>Solve problems together</h2>

<p>Each day, you and your typically developing child will probably come across tricky experiences and emotions. Shared problem-solving is a good way to work through them.</p>

<p>First it is important to recognise your child’s emotions before you try to solve problems. For example, you might see that she is getting angry about something that her sibling is doing. You could say, ‘It looks like you’re angry that your brother won’t turn off his favourite show on the TV. It is okay to feel angry’.</p>

<p>Pause for a moment to give your child time to calm down. Then you can work on the problem together. Depending on how old your child is, he might need more or less help to understand his feelings, calm down and come up with solutions.</p>

<h2>Help your typically developing child connect with others</h2>

<p>Feeling connected to people within and outside the family is important for all children.</p>

<p>For your typically developing child, this can happen by playing and socialising with friends, both those with and without siblings with disability. You could also help your typically developing child connect with others through team sports, extracurricular activities, or church and community organisations.</p>

<p>Older children and teenagers need the opportunity to spend time with friends without having to include their siblings.</p>

<p>Peer support groups for siblings might also help your child better understand disability, make more friends, get new ideas for handling tricky situations, and feel okay about himself and his feelings. These groups often operate through disability services or associations, local councils or young carer support services.</p>

<h2>Talk about the disability</h2>

<p>Your typically developing child might not understand her sibling’s disability. Your child might ask questions like, ‘Did I cause it?’, ‘Will it go away?’ or ‘Will I catch it?’ It is best to answer your child’s questions as honestly as possible, in language she can understand.</p>

<p>It is also good to let your child know what is likely to happen to his sibling, while being positive and realistic. For example, ‘Your sister has cerebral palsy. For your sister, that means that the muscles in her legs don’t work properly. She needs to use a wheelchair right now, but she’s having physiotherapy to help her legs work better’.</p>

<p>Encouraging your typically developing child to sometimes take part in her sibling’s therapy activities can also help her understand her sibling’s disability.</p>

<h2>Talk about other people’s reactions to disability</h2>

<p>You might feel worried about people’s reactions to your child’s disability, especially how these reactions might affect your typically developing child. Your child will find it easier to respond to other people’s reactions if he’s prepared for them.</p>

<p>You can talk with your child about how other people might react to her brother or sister and how that might make her feel. Let your child know it is okay to feel sad if people say hurtful things. It might help her to have a few things that she can say back. For example, ‘Your brother's brain just works differently from yours and mine’.</p>

<p>You can also let your child know that it is okay to say he does not want to talk about it, and that he doesn’t have to answer questions about his sister or brother if he doesn’t want to.</p>

<h2>Get support for siblings of children with disability</h2>

<p>Although siblings of children with disability are generally well adjusted, all children are different. Some children might find it harder than others and might need extra support.</p>

<p>As a parent, <strong>you are the best judge</strong> of whether your child needs more support. It is a good idea to ask for support if you notice that your typically developing child is:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>sleeping more or less than usual</li>
	<li>eating more or less than usual</li>
	<li>being more irritable</li>
	<li>showing less interest in things she used to enjoy</li>
	<li>avoiding or being aggressive towards her sibling with disability</li>
	<li>having trouble with schoolwork</li>
	<li>not wanting to spend time with friends</li>
	<li>behaving in an unusual way – for example, pretending to have a disability as well, or trying hard to do well or please everybody.</li>
</ul>

<p>The professionals supporting you and your family might be able to give you some advice. Alternatively, if you are worried about any of your children, it might help if you and your child talk with a psychologist or counsellor.</p>

<p>A sibling support group might help typically developing children cope and give them a chance to meet other children or teenagers in similar circumstances. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It’s easy to get caught up in looking after your children’s needs, but looking after yourself is important too. That’s because being fit, well and happy keeps you in good shape for looking after other people.</p>",5431,6,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"506, 2501, 2506, 491, 2521",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article:<a href=""//raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/family-life/siblings/supporting-siblings""> https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/family-life/siblings/supporting-siblings</a></p>",en,published
1466,Preschooler behaviour: what to expect,"Preschoolers are curious, easily distracted, keen on independence and still developing self-regulation. Preschool helps your child learn about getting along with others and following rules. Common preschooler behaviour concerns are tantrums, habits, lying and anxiety. Your preschooler needs you to guide his behaviour in positive ways.","<h2>Child behaviour in the preschool years</h2>

<p>Preschoolers are fascinated by the world around them<strong>, so you can expect</strong> lots of ‘who’, ‘what’ and ‘why’ questions. You might need to allow more time when you are doing things with your preschooler – for example, so she can stop and look at a snail on the footpath.</p>

<p>As they try to <strong>understand the world</strong>, preschoolers can sometimes get distracted. It might seem like your preschooler is not listening to you – but he might still be trying to figure out something you said five minutes ago.</p>

<p>Independence is important to preschoolers, who are very keen to do things for themselves. But your child needs your support to build confidence and self-esteem. Lots of positive attention, praise and opportunities to practise new skills will help.</p>

<p>And preschoolers are getting better at self-regulation, which is great for getting along with others at preschool or playgroup. But your child still needs your help with expressing strong feelings appropriately and managing behaviour, especially in challenging situations.</p>

<h2>Going to preschool: why it is good for children</h2>

<p>Children can benefit from going to preschool at this age.</p>

<p>Some children can take a while to get used to preschool or have fears about starting preschool. But it is worth sticking with it because preschool gives your child the chance to make friends and practise skills like sharing and taking turns. At preschool, children can start learning about following other people’s rules and getting along with other children.</p>

<h2>Child behaviour concerns in the preschool years</h2>

<p><strong>Anxiety</strong><br />
Anxiety is a normal part of children’s development, and preschoolers often fear things like being on their own or being in the dark. If your child worries too much or shows signs of anxiety, you can support her by acknowledging her fear, gently encouraging her to do things she is anxious about and praising her when she does. If anxiety is affecting your child’s life, see your doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Bullying</strong><br />
Bullying can be devastating for children’s confidence and self-esteem, especially in the preschool years. If your child is being bullied at preschool, he needs lots of love and support, both at home and at preschool. He also needs to know that you will take action to prevent any further bullying.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting</strong><br />
Disagreements and fighting among children are very common. A few factors affect fighting – temperament, environment, age and skills. You can work with these factors to handle fighting in your family.</p>

<p><strong>Habits</strong><br />
Lots of children have habits, like biting nails or twirling hair. Your child’s habits might bother you, but usually it is nothing to worry about. Most habits go away by themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Lying</strong><br />
You might have caught your child telling the occasional lie. Lying is part of development, and it often starts around three years of age. It is usually better to teach young children the value of honesty and telling the truth than to punish them for small lies.</p>

<p><strong>Shyness</strong><br />
Shy behaviour is normal in preschoolers. If your child is slow to warm up, try to support her in social situations. For example, you could stay at preschool for a while in the mornings during the early days. It is also good to praise your child for brave social behaviour, like responding to others, using eye contact, or playing away from you.</p>

<p><strong>Tantrums</strong><br />
If your child has tantrums, it might help to remember that he is still learning appropriate ways to express feelings. If you work on reducing your child’s stress, tuning into your child’s feelings, and spotting your child’s tantrum triggers, you should see fewer tantrums after he turns four.</p>

<p>Do not worry if your preschooler has an imaginary friend. Make-believe friends grow out of healthy, active imaginations. They give children a great way to express feelings and practise social skills.</p>

<h2>Helping preschool children behave well: tips</h2>

<p><strong>Use reminders</strong><br />
Preschoolers have short memories and are easily distracted. You might need to remind your child about things several times. For example, when it is nearly time to leave the park, try saying ‘We’re going home soon’. Then give another reminder closer to the time you are leaving – ‘Two more slides then we’re going’.</p>

<p><strong>Share feelings</strong><br />
If your preschooler understands how her behaviour affects you, she might be able to feel for you. So you might say, ‘I'm getting upset because there is so much noise, and I can’t talk on the phone’. When you start the sentence with ‘I’, it gives your child the chance to change things for your sake.</p>

<p><strong>Change the environment</strong><br />
You can often prevent or minimise problem behaviour by changing your child’s environment. For example, if your preschooler is getting frustrated because your baby keeps crawling over his toys, try to find a quiet spot where your preschooler can play undisturbed.</p>

<h2>Preschooler discipline and guiding child behaviour</h2>

<p>Discipline is helping your child learn how to behave – as well as how not to behave.</p>

<p>Discipline works best when you have a warm and loving relationship with your child and encourage good behaviour – for example, by using routines, clear instructions and plenty of praise for behaving well.</p>

<p>Family rules are a key aspect of discipline for children of all ages. They guide children’s behaviour in positive ways by stating exactly what behaviour you expect. But preschoolers are likely to forget or ignore rules, so they will need support and reminders to follow them.</p>

<p>Consequences are a handy way to guide children’s behaviour because they make it clear to children what not to do. You can tailor consequences to different situations, but consequences are always best when combined with a focus on your child’s positive behaviour.</p>

<p>Physical punishment like smacking does not teach children how to behave and can hurt children. It can also make children scared of you, which makes it harder to teach them how to behave well.</p>

<h2>Your preschoolers’s behaviour and your feelings</h2>

<p>When your child’s behaviour is challenging, you might feel angry or stressed.</p>

<p>Looking after yourself by eating well, getting enough sleep and doing some physical activity can help. It can also help to talk about your feelings with someone you trust, like your partner, a friend or your doctor.</p>

<p>Contact a child health professional if you have concerns about your child’s behaviour or you just do not know what to do about it.</p>",5426,6,"57,58",59,60,"496, 2541, 2576, 5171",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/preschooler-behaviour"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/preschooler-behaviour</a></p>",en,published
1471,Encouraging good behaviour: 15 tips,Try our practical tips to encourage the behaviour you want in your child.,"<h2>How to encourage good behaviour in your child</h2>

<p>A positive and constructive approach is often the best way to guide your child’s behaviour. This means giving your child attention when he behaves well, rather than just applying consequences when he does something you don’t like.</p>

<p>Here are some practical tips for putting this positive approach into action.</p>

<h2>Tips for good behaviour</h2>

<p><strong>1. Be a role model</strong><br />
Use your own behaviour to guide your child. Your child watches you to get clues on how to behave – and what you do is often much more important than what you say. For example, if you want your child to say ‘please’, say it yourself. If you do not want your child to raise her voice, speak quietly and gently yourself.</p>

<p><strong>2. Show your child how you feel</strong><br />
Telling your child honestly how his behaviour affects you helps him see his own feelings in yours. And if you start sentences with ‘I’, it gives your child the chance to see things from your perspective. For example, ‘I’m getting upset because there is so much noise that I can’t talk on the phone’.</p>

<p><strong>3. Catch your child being ‘good’</strong><br />
When your child is behaving in a way you like, give her some positive feedback. For example, ‘Wow, you’re playing so nicely. I really like the way you’re keeping all the blocks on the table’. This works better than waiting for the blocks to come crashing to the floor before you take notice and say, ‘Hey, stop that’.</p>

<p>This positive feedback is sometimes called descriptive praise because it tells children specifically what they are doing well. Try to make six positive comments for every negative comment. And remember that if children have a choice between no attention or negative attention, they will often seek out negative attention.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>4. Get down to your child’s level</strong><br />
When you get close to your child, you can tune in to what he might be feeling or thinking. Being close also helps him focus on what you are saying about his behaviour. If you are close to your child and have his attention, you do not need to make him look at you.</p>

<p><strong>5. Listen actively</strong><br />
To listen actively, you can nod as your child talks, and repeat back what you think your child is feeling. For example, ‘It sounds like you feel really sad that your blocks fell down’. When you do this, it can help young children cope with tension and big emotions like frustration, which sometimes lead to unwanted behaviour. It also makes them feel respected and comforted. It can even diffuse potential temper tantrums.</p>

<p><strong>6. Keep promises</strong><br />
When you follow through on your promises, good or bad, your child learns to trust and respect you. She learns that you will not let her down when you have promised something nice, and she also learns not to try to change your mind when you have explained a consequence. So when you promise to go for a walk after your child picks up her toys, make sure you have your walking shoes handy. When you say you will leave the library if your child does not stop running around, be prepared to leave straight away.</p>

<p><strong>7. Create an environment for good behaviour</strong><br />
The environment around your child can influence his behaviour, so you can shape the environment to help your child behave well. This can be as simple as making sure your child’s space has plenty of safe, stimulating things for him to play with. Make sure that your child cannot reach things he could break or that might hurt him. Your glasses look like so much fun to play with – it is hard for children to remember not to touch. Reduce the chance of problems by keeping breakables and valuables out of sight.</p>

<p><strong>8. Choose your battles</strong><br />
Before you get involved in anything your child is doing – especially to say ‘no’ or ‘stop’ – ask yourself if it really matters. By keeping instructions, requests and negative feedback to a minimum, you create less opportunity for conflict and bad feelings. Rules are important, but use them only when it is really important.</p>

<p><strong>9. Be firm about whining</strong><br />
If you give in when your child is whining for something, you can accidentally train her to whine more. ‘No’ means ‘no’, not maybe, so do not say it unless you mean it.</p>

<p><strong>10. Keep things simple and positive</strong><br />
If you give clear instructions in simple terms, your child will know what is expected of him – for example, ‘Please hold my hand when we cross the road’. And positive rules are usually better than negative ones, because they guide your child’s behaviour in a positive way. For example, ‘Please shut the gate’ is better than ‘Don’t leave the gate open’.</p>

<p><strong>11. Give children responsibility – and consequences</strong><br />
As your child gets older, you can give her more responsibility for her own behaviour. You can also give her the chance to experience the natural consequences of that behaviour. You do not have to be the bad guy all the time. For example, if it is your child’s responsibility to pack for a sleepover and she forgets her favourite pillow, she will have to manage without it for the night.</p>

<p>At other times you might need to provide consequences for unacceptable or dangerous behaviour. For these times, it’s best to ensure that you have explained the consequences and that your child has agreed to them in advance.</p>

<p><strong>12. Say it once and move on</strong><br />
If you tell your child what to do – or what not to do – too often, he might end up just tuning out. If you want to give him one last chance to cooperate, remind him of the consequences for not cooperating. Then start counting to three.</p>

<p><strong>13. Make your child feel important</strong><br />
Give your child some simple chores or things that she can do to help the family. This will make her feel important. If you can give your child lots of practice doing a chore, she will get better at it, feel good about doing it, and want to keep doing it. And if you give her some praise for her behaviour and effort, it will help to build her self-esteem.</p>

<p><strong>14. Prepare for challenging situations</strong><br />
There are times when looking after your child and doing things you need to do will be tricky. If you think about these challenging situations in advance, you can plan around your child’s needs. Give him a five-minute warning before you need him to change activities. Talk to him about why you need his cooperation. Then he is prepared for what you expect.</p>

<p><strong>15. Maintain a sense of humour</strong><br />
It often helps to keep daily life with children light. You can do this by using songs, humour and fun. For example, you can pretend to be the scary tickle monster who needs the toys picked up off the floor. Humour that has you both laughing is great, but humour at your child’s expense will not help. Young children are easily hurt by parental ‘teasing’.</p>

1476,"Praise, encouragement and rewards","No matter how old your children are, your praise and encouragement will help them feel good about themselves. This boosts their self-esteem and confidence. Sometimes rewards can be useful too, especially if you want to encourage good behaviour.","<h2>Praise</h2>

<p><strong>How praise works</strong><br />
Praise is when you tell your child what you like about her or her behaviour. Praise nurtures your child’s self-esteem, confidence and sense of self.</p>

<p>By using praise, you are showing your child how to think and talk positively about himself. You are helping your child learn how to recognise when he does well and feel proud about it. </p>

<p><strong>What to use praise for</strong><br />
You can praise children of different ages for different things. You might praise a younger child for leaving the park when asked, or for trying to tie her own shoelaces.</p>

<p><strong>Descriptive praise</strong><br />
Descriptive praise is when you tell your child exactly what it is that you like. For example, ‘I like the way you’ve found a spot for everything in your room’. This helps your child understand what you mean. It is also more genuine than non-specific praise like ‘You’re a good boy’.</p>

<p>You cannot give too much praise. But praise can lose its impact if it is not specific or if you use it when your child has not done anything. This might teach your child that she does not have to do anything to be praised.</p>

<p><strong>Using praise to change behaviour</strong><br />
Children are more likely to repeat behaviour that earns praise. This means you can use praise to help change difficult behaviour and replace it with desirable behaviour.</p>

<p>The first step is to watch for times when your child behaves the way you want. When you see this or another behaviour you like, immediately get your child’s attention. Then tell your child exactly what you liked.</p>

<p>At first, you can praise every time you see the behaviour. When your child starts doing the behaviour more often, you can praise it less.</p>

<p>If you are using praise to change behaviour, you can praise effort as well as achievement – for example, ‘It’s great how you used words to ask for that toy’.</p>

<p>Using praise can seem like an effort, and some days it might be hard to find reasons to praise your child. But if you praise your child regularly, it will soon feel natural and normal.</p>

<h2>Encouragement</h2>

<p>Encouragement is <strong>praise for effort</strong> – for example, ‘You worked hard on that maths homework’.</p>

<p>Praising effort can encourage your child to try hard in the future – it is very motivating. But you can also use encouragement before and during an activity to help your child do the activity or behaviour. For example, ‘Show me how well you can put your toys away’.</p>

<p>Some children, especially those who are less confident, need more encouragement than others. When praise is encouraging and focused on effort, children are more likely to see trying hard as a good thing in itself. They are also more likely to keep trying and to be optimistic when they face challenges.</p>

<h2>Rewards</h2>

<p>A reward is a consequence of good behaviour. It is <strong>a way of saying ‘well done’</strong> after your child has done something good or behaved well. It could be a treat, a surprise or an extra privilege. For example, as a reward for keeping his room tidy, you might let your child choose what to have for dinner.</p>

<p>Rewards can make your praise and encouragement work better. Most behaviour is influenced by the consequences that follow it, so when you praise your child’s behaviour and then reward it, the behaviour is more likely to happen again.</p>

<p>Rewards can work well at first, but it is best not to overuse them. If you need to use them a lot, it might help to rethink the situation – are there any other strategies that you could try to encourage the behaviour you want? Or is the task or behaviour too hard for your child right now?</p>

<p>Note that <strong>bribery and rewards aren’t the same</strong>. A bribe is given before the behaviour you want, and a reward is given after. Rewards reinforce good behaviour, but bribes don’t.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is easier to criticise than it is to compliment. Bad behaviour is often more obvious than good behaviour – for example, you are more likely to notice when your child is yelling than you are to notice when your child is quietly reading a book. Try to pay attention to the good behaviour too!</p>

<h2>Tips for using praise, encouragement and rewards</h2>

<p>Help build your child’s self-esteem and encourage good behaviour with these tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>When you feel good about your child, say so.</strong> See if you can give your child some words of encouragement every day. The small things you say can build up over time to have a big effect on your child.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to praise more than you criticise.</strong> As a guide, try to praise your child six times for every one time you say something negative.</li>
	<li><strong>Look for little changes and successes.</strong> Rather than waiting until your child has done something perfectly to give a compliment, try to praise any effort or improvement.</li>
	<li><strong>Accept that everyone is different.</strong> Praise your child for her unique strengths and encourage her to develop and feel excited about her particular interests. This will help her develop a sense of pride and confidence.</li>
	<li><strong>Surprise your child with a reward for good behaviour.</strong> For example, ‘Thanks for picking up the toys – let’s go to the park to celebrate’.</li>
	<li><strong>Praise effort as well as achievement.</strong> Recognise and praise how hard your child is trying – for example, ‘You worked really hard on that essay’ or ‘Thank you for remembering to hang your coat on the peg’.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to make your praise dependent on your child’s behaviour</strong>, rather than your feelings. You might find that the more you look for good behaviour to praise, the more positive you will feel (and the more good behaviour you will see).</li>

1486,Preschooler creative learning and development: what to expect,"Creative play develops preschooler confidence, language, physical and thinking skills, imagination and emotional understanding. Dramatic play helps preschoolers make sense of the world. Arts and craft activities encourage self-expression and decision-making. Sound play, music and dance let preschoolers express all kinds of feelings.","<h2>Creative play: why it’s important for preschooler learning and development</h2>

<p>The preschool years can be one of the most creative times in a child’s life. While your child’s imagination is still developing, drama, music, dance, arts and crafts can:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>foster creativity</li>
	<li>build your child’s confidence</li>
	<li>help your child express feelings and learn communication skills</li>
	<li>help your child develop, practise and improve coordination and motor skills</li>
	<li>give your child a chance to practice decision-making, problem-solving and critical thinking</li>
	<li>help your child find new ways of looking at things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning and development through drama</h2>

<p>Your preschooler will often use new songs and stories as the basis for drama and dramatic play. One moment she’s a crocodile eating chickens, and the next she’s an owl!</p>

<p>Taking on a role and seeing the world from someone else’s point of view <strong>helps your child to make sense of the world and express feelings</strong>.</p>

<p>Drama and storytelling also give your child opportunities to build and practise vocabulary, use imagination and learn about the structure of stories. Sometimes your child might prefer to tell stories alone. At other times, your child might enjoy it more if you join in.</p>

<p>Preschoolers often get completely involved in stories too. For example, when you read your preschooler a story, you might notice him moving his arms, legs or face and miming what is happening in the story.</p>

<h2>Learning and development through arts and crafts</h2>

<p>Preschoolers love to express themselves and their ideas using crayons, paints, playdough, clay, scissors, glue and paper. You might find your child needs help to use thin pencils, scissors or sticky tape.</p>

<p>Your child will begin making basic shapes, and might <strong>enjoy experimenting with texture, space and colours in pieces of art</strong>. For example, preschoolers often draw houses with shining suns above the roof. This is because this kind of picture is made up of basic shapes like squares, triangles and circles.</p>

<p>Craft activities also let your child make decisions for herself. For example, should be roof be red or blue?</p>

<h2>Musical learning and development</h2>

<p>Preschoolers use musical instruments – including their own voices – to express feelings and ideas.</p>

<p>Your child will enjoy singing just for the sake of singing. He will love songs with repetition and simple melodies. He can make up his own words to familiar songs, and words often come from the events and people around him.</p>

<p>Your preschooler can usually <strong>recognise and name favourite songs, and sing more of them</strong>. Singing helps children understand the differences between fast and slow, long and short, and loud and soft.</p>

<p>Preschoolers might also enjoy group singing games.</p>

<h3>Learning and development through dance</h3>

<p>Music and movement helps your child’s physical and concentration skills. Your preschooler can move fast or slow, or make up actions and dance moves to go along with music.</p>

<p>Your child might also express feelings of sadness, happiness, joy or excitement through movement. For example, your child might jump for joy or stamp angrily.</p>

<p>You might find your child flying like a butterfly, creeping like a caterpillar or hopping like a frog. These play movements help her understand more about the world. You can encourage this activity by giving her props. For example, your child could wave around a scarf to pretend she is flying.</p>",5591,6,"57,58",59,60,"2586, 2591, 2596, 2566",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/creative-development/preschooler-creative-development"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/creative-development/preschooler-creative-development</a></p>",en,published

Follow your child’s lead and boost his confidence with descriptive praise about his creative activities. Use household items, recycled objects and natural materials to spark your child’s creative play.","<h2>Encouraging your preschooler’s creative play</h2>

<p>For your preschooler, <strong>time, materials and space to be creative</strong> are very important.</p>

<p>Preschoolers like to be spontaneous in their creative play, so it is good to follow your child’s lead. But there will also be times when your child wants you to be more involved in her creative activities. By being actively involved, you can develop your child’s skills and understanding.</p>

<p>It is good to show your child that <strong>there is more than one way to do something</strong>. For example, there is more than one way to draw a person, build a sandcastle or play a drum. This lets children know they can develop their own ideas.</p>

<p>You do not need to give your child new or expensive play materials. Homemade, recycled and natural materials are all low-cost ways to stimulate play and imagination.</p>

<p>And whatever artworks your child comes up with, give your child lots of descriptive praise. For example, ‘I love the picture you drew. You really know how to put colours together’. This boosts confidence and encourages your child to keep playing creatively.</p>

<p>Not sure what to expect when it comes to creative play? Read more about preschooler creative learning and development.</p>

<h2>Creative activities: arts and crafts</h2>

<p>Everyday and recycled objects can encourage your child’s creative development. For example:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Give your child an empty cardboard box to make a house, a robot, a truck, an animal – whatever your child is interested in. Your child could paint the box or decorate it with craft materials.</li>
	<li>Use empty kitchen or toilet rolls or small plastic juice bottles to make people. Draw on faces, stick on paper clothes, and use cotton wool for hair. Your child could use these new toys to make up stories.</li>
	<li>Go on a nature walk to look for natural materials to make art. For example, in autumn collect fallen leaves for drawing, pasting onto paper or dipping into paint.</li>
	<li>Use small plastic lids and other small items that you can string together to make jewellery.</li>
	<li>Keep a resource box with things like string, wrapping paper scraps, stickers and straws that your child can use to make whatever she wants.</li>
	<li>Find apps or games that your preschooler can use to make digital art. For example, there are apps for free drawing or arranging photos into collages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a home art gallery for your child’s artwork. A kitchen wall or pinboard is ideal for sticking up pictures and paintings. You could ask your child to choose one special painting each week to frame in the centre of the gallery. This shows that you value your preschooler’s creations.</p>

<h2>Creative activities: drama</h2>

<p>Preschoolers love dramatic play. Here are some ideas to get you and your child started:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Instead of throwing out old clothes, start a dress-up box or bag. You can also find cheap and unusual clothes and props at second hand shops.</li>
	<li>Use puppets to put on shows. It’s easy to make simple puppets. You can use a cardboard box to create a puppet theatre too.</li>
	<li>Use drama, song and movement to act out things from daily life. It could be doctors, mothers, fathers, shopkeepers, firefighters – whatever your child likes.</li>
	<li>At story time, encourage your child to act out roles from a story with movements or sounds. For example, your child could pretend to be a dragon or a lamb.</li>
	<li>Video your preschooler as he plays. Help him use a movie-making app to make it into a special video to share with family and friends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creative activities: music, movement and dance</h2>

<p>Music, movement and dance can often be part of simple, everyday play with your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Give your child a saucepan, a saucepan lid and a wooden spoon – your child can use this as a drum kit.</li>
	<li>Watch short videos of animals making noise and moving in the wild. Your child might enjoy copying animal movements and sounds.</li>
	<li>Play instruments in ways that match animals and their movement. For example, shake a shaker slowly like a plodding elephant or loudly like an excited monkey.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to march, roll, stamp, hop, slide and twirl. Put on some favourite music to get your child moving or coming up with new actions.</li>
	<li>By reciting nursery rhymes and singing songs, help your child develop a sense of rhythm.</li>
	<li>Point out sounds with steady beats, like a ticking clock or a dripping tap. Encourage your child to clap, tap, march or bang to the beat.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is good to include some ‘art appreciation’ in your child’s life. Whether it is music, drama or pictures, you can encourage your child to talk about what she likes and which is her favourite part. Why not visit a local art gallery or exhibition together and talk about what you see?</p>",5406,6,"57,58",59,60,"2586, 2566, 226, 4831",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/creative-development/preschooler-creative-activities"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/development/creative-development/preschooler-creative-activities</a></p>",en,published
1496,Breastmilk and breastfeeding: benefits,Breastmilk contains nutrients your baby needs for growth and development and protects your baby against infections and diseases.Breastfeeding is free and convenient and can promote bonding between you and your baby.It’s recommended you breastfeed exclusively until your baby starts solid foods at around 6 months and keep breastfeeding until at least 12 months.,"<h2>Breastmilk and breastfeeding benefits</h2>

<p>Breastmilk really is a wonder – a complete meal, ready whenever and wherever you and your baby are.</p>

<p>Most mothers can breastfeed if they have the right information, support and care.</p>

<h2>Breastmilk for babies: what the experts say</h2>

<p>Here are some reasons why experts say that breastmilk is the natural food for your baby.</p>

<p><strong>Breastmilk: designed by nature</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Breastmilk has developed over millions of years to be exactly suited to your baby’s needs. Although baby formula manufacturers try to copy breastmilk as closely as they can, formula won’t ever be exactly the same as breastmilk.</li>
	<li>Breastmilk adapts to your baby’s changing needs as he gets older and has fewer feeds. It even changes during a feed – the first milk is thirst-quenching, and the last milk is rich, creamy and full of good fats.</li>
	<li>The taste of breastmilk changes with whatever you’ve eaten, which means that a breastfed baby is likely to accept new tastes when she starts eating solids.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Breastmilk: a complete food</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Breastmilk contains all the nutrients<strong> </strong>your baby needs for the first six months of life. Your baby doesn’t need any water or foods other than breastmilk in these early months.</li>
	<li>Breastmilk is easy to digest and is easily absorbed into your baby’s system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Breastmilk: a basis for healthy development</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Both colostrum and mature breastmilk contain antibodies and other agents that help protect your baby<strong> </strong>from infection and reduce the risk of diseases like gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, ear infections and type-1 diabetes.</li>
	<li>The good fats in breastmilk are important for baby brain development.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding is important for baby eyesight, speech, jaw and mouth development.</li>
	<li>Babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and fatal sleeping accidents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Breastfeeding encourages skin-to-skin contact and eye contact between you and your baby. Being physically connected to your baby can help him bond with you and feel secure.</p>

<h2>Breastfeeding: why it’s good for mothers</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Breastfeeding is convenient.</strong> You don’t have to sterilise bottles, scrub teats, carry bottles and sterile water when you go out, mix powder, keep baby formula chilled or warm formula for feeds.</li>
	<li>Breastmilk is free.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding can help some women lose weight after the birth.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding mothers get back to sleep more easily than formula-feeding mothers, and their sleep cycles are more in tune with their babies’ cycles.</li>
	<li>Women who breastfeed have lower rates of breast cancer, osteoporosis and type-2 diabetes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Breastfeeding: your choice</h2>

<p><strong>In the end, it’s an individual choice</strong> – but it should be an informed choice.</p>

<p>If you decide not to breastfeed, rest assured that formulas give your baby adequate nutrition. And if you need to supplement breastmilk with formula, it doesn’t mean that breastfeeding has to stop completely.</p>

<h2>How long to feed your baby breastmilk</h2>

<p>It’s recommended that you breastfeed exclusively until you introduce solid foods when your baby starts showing signs she’s ready, which usually happens around six months. It’s around this time that babies start to need extra nutrients for growth and development.</p>

<p>Your baby needs only small amounts of food for the first few months of solids, and breastmilk is still baby’s main source of nutrition. Once you introduce solids, it’s best for your baby if you keep breastfeeding along with giving your baby solids until your baby is at least 12 months old.</p>

<p>After that, it’s really up to you and your baby how long you keep going. If you decide to breastfeed for longer, your baby will get added benefits like protection against infections in the toddler years.</p>",181,1,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50",59,60,"2601, 401, 2606, 2621",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/nutritious-food/breastmilk-breastfeeding-benefits</p>,en,published

1526,Weaning: stopping breastfeeding,"Take weaning slowly so your baby gets used to the change in routine and diet, and your body can get used to no longer making milk.Depending on your baby’s age, you can wean to a cup or bottle. Your baby’s age also determines whether you wean to infant formula or cow’s milk.When you start to wean, breastfeeding might give you less protection from getting pregnant, so it’s a good idea to consider your contraception.","<h2>What is weaning?</h2>

<p>Weaning means <strong>stopping breastfeeding</strong>.</p>

<p>Weaning is the end of breastfeeding, when your baby no longer has any breastmilk. Weaning starts when your baby has any food other than breastmilk at times during the day, and weaning ends when she no longer has any breastmilk.</p>

<p>You might decide to stop breastfeeding when or before your baby reaches 6 or 12 months. For example, you might find that you start thinking about weaning when you’re getting ready to return to work.</p>

<p>Your baby might even start weaning before you’re ready, but this is less common.</p>

<p>Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended until your baby starts eating solid foods at around six months. It’s best for your baby if you keep breastfeeding while giving your baby solids until at least 12 months.</p>

<h2>The weaning process</h2>

<p>When you’re stopping breastfeeding, it’s a good idea to <strong>take it slowly</strong>. This way your baby can get used to the change in routine and diet, and your body can get used to no longer making milk.</p>

<p>If the decision to wean is yours rather than your baby’s, you might need to offer some extra comfort as you and your baby make the transition to bottle-feeding or drinking from a cup. Plenty of cuddles and time with you can help your baby feel secure and loved without relying on the breast.</p>

<p><strong>Weaning for baby</strong><br />
You can <strong>wean baby to a cup or a bottle</strong>. This decision depends on your baby’s age – if your baby is around 7-8 months, he could learn to drink straight from a cup.</p>

<p>The age of your baby also determines whether to replace breastfeeds with <strong>infant formula or cow’s milk</strong> – babies younger than 12 months shouldn’t be offered cow’s milk, so they need to be weaned onto formula.</p>

<p>When you start the weaning process, the first step is to replace the breastfeed your baby seems least keen on with expressed breastmilk, infant formula or cow’s milk, from a cup or bottle. Drop one breastfeed at a time, and wait a few days or a week before you drop the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Weaning for mum</strong><br />
If you stop breastfeeding quickly, your breasts might fill with milk (engorge) and get very uncomfortable. To prevent engorged breasts, you might need to express your milk sometimes. Express just enough for comfort – if you express too much you’ll actually stimulate an increase in supply.</p>

<p>Some mums need to go from one feed a day to one feed every few days to avoid engorged breasts, before stopping breastfeeding altogether.</p>

<p>Watch out for <strong>lumpy breasts</strong>. After your baby has stopped breastfeeding, you might have lumpy breasts for 5-10 days. A lump might indicate a blocked duct or the beginnings of mastitis. If this happens, try massaging the lumps or expressing a small amount of milk. This might help reduce the lumpiness.</p>

<p>If any lump is persistent or painful or you start feeling flu-like symptoms, <strong>see your GP</strong> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If your baby is older than six months and developing well, you might decide to try night weaning while still breastfeeding during the day. On the other hand, if you’re comfortable with feeding your baby during the night, there’s no hurry to phase out night feeds. You can choose what works best for you and your baby.</p>

<h2>Weaning, pregnancy and contraception</h2>

<p>Breastfeeding gives you some protection from getting pregnant, especially if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you’ve been exclusively breastfeeding</li>
	<li>your periods haven’t started again</li>
	<li>your baby is less than six months old and doesn’t sleep for long periods between feeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you start to wean your baby, breastfeeding might give you less protection from getting pregnant, so it’s a good idea to <strong>consider other forms of contraception</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about oral contraception – either the combined pill or the minipill – there are a couple of things to bear in mind:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It’s safe to start the combined pill (oestrogen and progesterone) while your baby is still having some breastfeeds. The combined pill helps reduce your supply of breastmilk.</li>
	<li>You need to take greater care with the minipill if it’s your only contraception in addition to breastfeeding. For example, you must take it within three hours of the same time every day.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pill is prescription medicine, so you’ll need to <strong>see your GP or obstetrician </strong>to get it. Your doctor will talk you through how to use it properly so you’re protected from getting pregnant.</p>

<h2>Things to note about stopping breastfeeding</h2>

<p>To wean an older baby or toddler, you might want to go slowly, changing your child’s routine gradually.</p>

<p>It’s also quite common to feel a bit down after your last feed, even if you were looking forward to weaning.</p>

<p>Your hormones might take some time to return to normal. Some women begin ovulating as soon as they reduce night feeds or begin to wean, while others find that the return of ovulation and menstruation takes several months.</p>",12716,1,"46,47,48,49",59,60,"2761, 2766, 2771",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/breastfeeding-bottle-feeding-solids/weaning/weaning</p>,en,published
1531,Night weaning and phasing out night feeds: things to think about,"There’s no hurry to phase out night feeds. You can choose what works best for you and your baby.Night weaning and phasing out night feeds might be an option for healthy babies over six months old.If your baby isn’t feeding for long or isn’t drinking much milk, you can replace night feeds with another settling technique.If your baby has longer feeds or bigger drinks, you can make the transition gradually.","<h2>Night weaning and phasing out night feeds: when to do it</h2>

<p><strong>From six months of age</strong>, if your baby is developing well, it’s OK to think about night weaning for breastfed babies and phasing out night feeds for bottle-fed babies. At this age, most babies are getting enough food during the day for healthy growth and development.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you’re comfortable with feeding your baby during the night, <strong>there’s no hurry to phase out night feeds</strong>. You can choose what works best for you and your baby.</p>

<p>Before you decide, it’s a good idea to talk with your child and family health nurse or GP to get advice that suits your individual situation.</p>

<p><strong>When the time is right for you and your baby</strong>, our suggestions below can help you make the transition away from night feeds.</p>

<h2>Night weaning breastfed babies</h2>

<p>If you decide to try night weaning, your baby still gets all the benefits of breastmilk if you keep breastfeeding during the day.</p>

<p>If your <strong>baby’s night-time feed is short</strong> (less than five minutes), you can phase out night feeds by stopping the feed altogether and re-settling your baby with the settling techniques of your choice. Note that it might take several nights for you and your baby to get used to the new routine.</p>

<p>If your baby’s feed is <strong>usually longer than five minutes</strong>, you can gradually cut down the time you spend feeding over 5-7 nights. This will help your baby get used to the change.</p>

<p>Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Time the length of your baby’s usual night feed.</li>
	<li>Cut down on the time your baby spends feeding by 2-5 minutes every second night. For example, if your baby usually feeds for 15 minutes, you’d feed for 13 minutes for two nights, then 11 minutes for the next two nights, then 9 minutes for the next two nights, and so on.</li>
	<li>Re-settle your baby after each shortened feed with the settling techniques of your choice.</li>
	<li>Once your baby is feeding for five minutes or less, stop the feed altogether.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you choose, you can cut down the time faster – for example, by five minutes every two nights.</p>

<p>It’s recommended that you breastfeed exclusively until your baby starts eating solid foods, which usually happens around six months. Once you introduce solids, it’s best for your baby if you keep breastfeeding along with giving your baby solids until your baby is at least 12 months old. After that, it’s up to you and your baby how long you keep going. For more information, check out our breastfeeding articles and our breastfeeding videos.</p>

<h2>Phasing out night feeds for bottle-fed babies</h2>

<p>If you decide to try phasing out night feeds and your baby is having <strong>60 ml of milk or less</strong> during a night feed, you can stop the feed altogether and re-settle your baby with the settling techniques of your choice.</p>

<p>If your baby’s feed is <strong>more than 60 ml</strong> each night, you can gradually cut down the amount your baby drinks over 5-7 nights.</p>

<p>Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Reduce the volume of milk by 20-30 ml every second night. For example, if your baby usually drinks 180 ml, you would give 150 ml for two nights, then 120 ml for the next two nights, and so on.</li>
	<li>Re-settle your baby after each smaller feed with the settling techniques of your choice.</li>
	<li>Once you get down to 60 ml or less in the bottle, stop the feed altogether.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you stop the night feed, you might notice that your baby begins to feed more during the day. This improvement in daytime appetite could take another week to settle in.</p>",12716,1,"45,46,47,48",59,60,"2776, 2781, 2786, 2791, 2796, 2801, 2806, 2826, 2831",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/sleep/settling-routines/night-weaning</p>,en,published

This is around six months, but not before four months.First foods might be smooth, mashed or in soft pieces. Your baby can go on to minced and chopped foods.Introduce different foods to your baby in any order, as long as you include iron-rich foods. There are some foods to avoid.Keep breastfeeding or using infant formula until your baby is at least 12 months.From around six months, all babies should have foods that cause allergies.","<h2>Introducing solids: why babies need them</h2>

<p>As babies get older, they start to need solid food so they can get enough iron and other essential nutrients for growth and development.</p>

<p>For about the first six months of life, babies use iron stored in their bodies from when they were in the womb. They also get some iron from breastmilk and/or infant formula. But babies’ iron stores go down as they grow. And by around six months, they can’t get the iron they need from breastmilk or infant formula alone.</p>

<p>Introducing solids is also important for helping babies learn to eat, giving them experience of new tastes and textures from a range of foods. It develops their teeth and jaws, and it builds other skills that they’ll need later for language development.</p>

<h2>Signs that it’s time for introducing solids</h2>

<p>Your baby’s individual development and behaviour will guide you when you’re trying to work out when to start introducing solids.</p>

<p>Signs your baby is ready for solids include when your baby:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>has good head and neck control and can sit upright when supported</li>
	<li>shows an interest in food – for example, by looking at what’s on your plate</li>
	<li>reaches out for your food</li>
	<li>opens their mouth when you offer them food on a spoon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most babies start to show these signs<strong> by around six months</strong>, but the signs happen at different times for different babies.</p>

<p>It’s not recommended to introduce solids before four months.</p>

<p>If your baby is nearing seven months of age and hasn’t started solids, you might like to get some advice from your child and family health nurse or GP.</p>

<h2>Getting the timing right when introducing solids</h2>

<p>When you’re first introducing solids, it’s a good idea to offer solids when you and your baby are both happy and relaxed.</p>

<p>Your baby is also more likely to try solids after a feed of breastmilk or formula. This is because when babies are really hungry, they just want the breastmilk or formula that they know satisfies their hunger. They’ll still have space in their tummies for new foods after they’ve had a feed of breastmilk or formula.</p>

<p>As time passes, you’ll learn when your baby is hungry or full, not interested or tired.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of hunger</strong> include your baby:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>getting excited when they see you getting their food ready</li>
	<li>leaning towards you while they’re sitting in the highchair</li>
	<li>opening their mouth as you’re about to feed them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Signs your baby is no longer interested include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>turning their head away</li>
	<li>losing interest or getting distracted</li>
	<li>pushing the spoon away</li>
	<li>clamping their mouth shut.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you’re introducing solids, how much food should you give your baby? Try 1-2 teaspoons of food to start with, and increase according to your baby’s appetite. By 12 months, your baby should be eating around three small meals a day plus breastmilk or infant formula.</p>

<h2>Food texture when introducing solids</h2>

<p>When your baby is ready for solids, first foods might be <strong>smooth, mashed or in soft pieces</strong>, depending on what baby likes. Your baby can quickly go on to minced foods and then chopped foods.</p>

<p>Your baby needs a <strong>variety of food textures</strong>. This helps your baby learn how to chew, and chewing helps with speech development. It also helps to encourage self-feeding and prevent feeding difficulties as your baby develops.</p>

<p>By the time your baby is 12 months old, they should be eating the same foods that the rest of the family is eating. But you might still need to chop some foods into smaller pieces and cook vegetables until they’re soft.</p>

<p>To prevent choking, always supervise babies and young children while they’re eating solid food. Take special care with hard foods like nuts and meat with small bones, because these are choking hazards. And if your baby can move around, make sure baby is sitting down while they’re eating. If you sit with your baby while they’re eating, baby is less likely to move around.</p>

<h2>Food types when introducing solids</h2>

<p>All new foods are exciting for your baby – there’s no need to cook ‘special’ foods.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>introduce solids in any order, as long as you include iron-rich foods and the food is the right texture</strong>.</p>

<p>Iron-rich foods include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>iron-fortified infant cereal</li>
	<li>minced meat, poultry and fish</li>
	<li>cooked tofu and legumes</li>
	<li>mashed, cooked egg (don’t give raw or runny egg).</li>
</ul>

<p>To these iron-rich foods, you can add other healthy foods like:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>vegetables – for example, cooked potato, carrot or green vegetables like broccoli</li>
	<li>fruit – for example, banana, apple, melon or avocado</li>
	<li>grains – for example, oats, bread, rice and pasta</li>
	<li>dairy foods – for example, yoghurt and full-fat cheese.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can mix first foods together – there’s no need to introduce just one food at a time. And if you offer your baby a variety of foods, baby can try lots of new tastes and also get a range of nutrients.</p>

<p>Our tips for introducing solid foods explain how to get your baby interested in new foods and manage mealtime mess and play.</p>

<h2>Breastmilk and infant formula while introducing solids</h2>

<p><strong>Keep breastfeeding or using infant formula until at least 12 months</strong>, as well as introducing solids.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure whether your baby is getting the right amount of milk once they start solids, baby’s behaviour will tell you.</p>

<p>For example, if your baby has been eating plenty of solids and isn’t finishing or is refusing milk, they might be ready for less frequent but larger milk feeds each day. If your baby isn’t interested in solids, they might be too full from milk feeds. This means it might be time to reduce milk feeds.</p>

<p>By around nine months, babies have generally developed enough chewing and swallowing skills to move from having milk before solids to having milk after solids.</p>

<p>Solids don’t replace breastfeeding or infant formula. If solid food replaces breastmilk and/or infant formula too quickly, babies can miss out on important nutrition.</p>

<h2>Introducing water</h2>

<p>Once your baby has reached six months, you can start to offer baby <strong>cooled, boiled water </strong>in a cup at mealtimes or at other times during the day. This is so your baby can practise drinking from a cup, but baby still doesn’t really need fluids other than breastmilk or formula at this age. Once your baby has reached 12 months, you can offer fresh tap water without boiling it.</p>

<h2>Foods and drinks to avoid while introducing solids</h2>

<p>There are some <strong>foods to avoid </strong>until your baby is a certain age:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>honey until 12 months – this is to avoid the risk of infant botulism</li>
	<li>raw or runny eggs and foods containing raw eggs like home-made mayonnaise until 12 months – bacteria in raw eggs can be harmful to babies</li>
	<li>reduced-fat dairy until two years</li>
	<li>whole nuts and similar hard foods until three years – these are choking hazards.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some <strong>drinks to avoid</strong> until your baby is a certain age:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>pasteurised full-fat cow’s milk as a main drink until 12 months</li>
	<li>soy milk, goat’s milk and sheep’s milk until two years (you can give fortified soy products before two years old)</li>
	<li>rice, oat, almond or coconut milk until two years old, unless you’ve consulted with your GP or child and family health nurse</li>
	<li>unpasteurised milk of all types, tea, coffee or sugar-sweetened drinks at all ages</li>
	<li>fruit juice – this should be limited at all ages (fruit has the nutrients baby needs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Your baby doesn’t need added salt or sugar. Processed or packaged foods with high levels of fat, sugar and/or salt aren’t good for babies and children. These foods include cakes, biscuits, chips and fried foods.</p>

<h2>Food allergy and introducing solids</h2>

<p><strong>Introducing allergenic foods early can reduce the risk</strong> of your child developing food allergy.</p>

<p>All babies, including babies with a high allergy risk, should try solid foods that cause allergies <strong>from around six months of age</strong>. These foods include well-cooked egg, peanut butter, wheat (from wheat-based breads, cereals and pasta) and cow’s milk (but not as a main drink).</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to get advice from your GP, child and family health nurse, dietitian, paediatrician or allergy and immunology specialist if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your baby already has a food allergy</li>
	<li>your family has a history of food allergy and you’re concerned about starting solids</li>
	<li>you’re worried about reactions to foods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Babies with severe eczema or who have parents with food allergies are more likely to develop a food allergy. But most children with food allergy don’t have parents with food allergy.</p>",12716,1,"45,46",59,60,"2836, 2841, 2851",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/nutritious-food/introducing-solids</p>,en,published

<p>When you’re first introducing solids, meals and mealtimes can be pretty flexible. Here are some tips to help with early meals:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Choose a time of day when you and your baby are calm, relaxed and not in a rush.</li>
	<li>Wash hands, spoons, bowls and plates before eating or preparing food, but there’s no need to sterilise anything.</li>
	<li>Sit your baby in a highchair, or somewhere safe, and feed her the food on a spoon.</li>
	<li>Give your baby a spoon to practise eating with. Sometimes it works if both you and your baby have spoons.</li>
	<li>Give your baby pieces of soft food, so he can try feeding himself.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is the right time to start introducing solids? When your baby shows signs of being ready. This is around six months old, but not before four months.</p>

<h2>Getting your baby interested in solid foods: tips</h2>

<p>By the time your baby is 12 months old, she should be eating the same healthy foods that the rest of the family is eating. Here are some ideas for developing your baby’s interest in new foods after she has started on solids:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Offer foods that your baby is interested in – that is, foods that baby is reaching for or looking at.</li>
	<li>Talk with your baby about the food he’s eating – what it is, what colour it is, how it tastes, where it grows, and how you cooked it.</li>
	<li>Offer your baby tastes of what you’re eating to introduce the flavours of your home-cooked meals. This is also a good time for you to think about the foods you eat and enjoy healthy foods together as a family.</li>
	<li>As your baby starts eating more solids, feed her during family meals each day, if you can. Your baby might be more interested in food if the rest of the family is eating too.</li>
	<li>Be guided by your baby’s interest and appetite levels. It’s normal for your baby’s appetite to change from day to day.</li>
	<li>If your baby refuses a new food, just offer it again tomorrow. <strong>Sometimes babies and children need to try new foods more than 10 times </strong>before they accept them.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s normal for babies to make funny faces when they try new foods. If your baby makes a face, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t like the food.</p>

<h2>Managing mealtime play and mess</h2>

<p>You can expect your baby’s eating to be very messy and slow. This is because eating is a skill that babies have to learn, including how to get food to their mouths. It’s also because babies learn about the world around them by touching and playing with new foods.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to help your baby get the most out of mealtimes and manage mealtime mess:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Encourage your baby to explore foods with her fingers. This builds skills in other areas of her development, like fine motor skills and thinking.</li>
	<li>Try to stay calm and patient with your baby’s mess. This will help your baby to enjoy mealtimes.</li>
	<li>Make cleaning up easier by spreading newspaper or plastic under the highchair and having a washcloth handy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Introducing solids is about much more than just food! Once your baby is eating solids, mealtimes can become family time – time to talk, listen and bond with each other.</p>",12716,1,"46,47",59,60,,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/nutritious-food/solid-foods-practical-tips-for-getting-started</p>,en,published
1546,Children learning to feed themselves,"Children learning to feed themselves are developing independence, fine motor skills and food awareness.Start your child off with finger foods and then give him lots of practice using a spoon.Small, plastic, non-breakable cups are good for children learning to use a cup.Mealtime mess can be stressful. Use a bib, or put a plastic dropsheet or newspaper under the highchair.","<h2>Children feeding themselves: why it’s an important stage</h2>

<p>When children are learning to feed themselves, it’s an important stage for lots of reasons.</p>

<p>First, children are learning to eat independently, which is a skill they need to develop for the later years of early childhood – and for life.</p>

<p>Second, this stage involves lots of feeling, squeezing and dropping food. It might seem messy, but it’s one of the ways your child develops fine motor skills like learning to hold a spoon.</p>

<p>Third, this is a chance to help your child learn more about the taste, texture, smell and temperature of food. For example, she’ll learn that it’s easier to pick up a piece of banana or kiwi fruit than a handful of yoghurt or spaghetti bolognaise.</p>

<h2>What to expect when children are learning to feed themselves</h2>

<p>Once you introduce solid food, your child might show signs of wanting to feed himself. For example, he might start reaching out for the spoon or trying to take food off your plate.</p>

<p>It’s normal for your child to want to feed herself and it’s great to encourage this – although it’s often messy and can sometimes be frustrating.</p>

<p>Be patient – your child will get there eventually. You might like to keep a camera handy to catch the funny side of this feeding stage.</p>

<p><strong>Starting with finger foods</strong><br />
Finger foods are soft, bite-sized pieces of food that are easy for baby to pick up and mash between his gums or teeth. If your child is showing interest in feeding himself, you can start with finger foods that you can put in your child’s hand, like a small piece of soft fruit or soft, cooked vegetables like potato or pumpkin.</p>

<p><strong>Top tip</strong>: put a few pieces of food within your baby’s reach. You can add more when she finishes them or drops them. This way the food won’t all end up on the floor at the start.</p>

<p><strong>Using a spoon</strong><br />
Most babies won’t be able to use a spoon until they’re about 18 months old. But it’s a good idea to let your child use a spoon from a much earlier age. Usually babies will let you know when they want to start, by constantly reaching for the spoon.</p>

<p><strong>Top tip</strong>: feed your baby with one spoon while he holds another one.</p>

<p>To prevent choking, always supervise your child when she’s learning to feed herself. Make sure she’s sitting up, and not playing or crawling around. Some foods – for example, whole nuts and hard foods like chopped raw carrot – are choking hazards. Children who are learning to eat shouldn’t have these foods.</p>

<h2>How to handle mess and food play</h2>

<p>Messy eating and playing with food are normal parts of your baby’s development when he’s learning to eat independently.</p>

<p>If you find the mess stressful, it can help if you:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>put a bib on your baby</li>
	<li>cut food into strips or fingers so that it’s easier to pick up and eat</li>
	<li>let your baby eat with her hands</li>
	<li>put a plastic sheet or newspaper under the highchair</li>
	<li>take the highchair outside if you have a safe flat area.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s normal for your baby to drop or throw food on the floor. If you react when he does this, he might think it’s the start of an exciting new game. One way to handle this is to ignore it. Calmly pick up the food without a fuss. Or you can leave the food on the floor until the meal is over, so you just have the one clean-up.</p>

<h2>Using a cup</h2>

<p>Once your baby has reached six months, she’s ready to learn to drink from a cup. Like learning to eat, this can be a slow and messy process.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to help when your child is learning to drink from a cup:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Give your child a small plastic, non-breakable cup that’s easy to grip and hold.</li>
	<li>Let your child play with the cup first so that he gets used to the way it feels.</li>
	<li>The first few times your child uses the cup, guide her by holding the cup too.</li>
	<li>Use only a small amount of liquid in the cup to reduce spills.</li>
	<li>At family mealtimes use a cup yourself to show your child how it’s done – babies love to copy their parents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children aged 6-12 months should have only cooled, boiled tap water, or breastmilk or infant formula. After 12 months, children can have full-fat cow’s milk. Drinks like fruit juice, soft drinks and flavoured milks aren’t recommended for babies and children. They have lots of sugar and increase the risk of tooth decay.</p>",12716,1,"46,47,48",59,60,,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/nutrition-fitness/family-meals/learning-to-feed-themselves</p>,en,published
1551,Vitamins and minerals,"We need vitamins and minerals to grow, to see properly, to make bones, muscles and organs, and to battle infections. If we don’t get enough of all the vitamins and minerals, it can lead to serious problems.","<ul>
</ul>

<h2>Vitamins and minerals: the basics</h2>

<p>Your child needs lots of essential vitamins and minerals for growth and development. They include vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K and minerals like calcium, iron, iodine and zinc.</p>

<p>The best way for your child to get enough vitamins and minerals is by <strong>eating a wide variety of foods from the five food groups</strong>, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>vegetables</li>
	<li>fruit</li>
	<li>grain food – bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, rice, corn and so on</li>
	<li>reduced-fat dairy food – milk, yoghurt and cheese</li>
	<li>meat, fish, chicken, eggs, tofu, legumes (peas, beans, lentils, chickpeas and so on) and nuts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our bodies absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients better when they come from food, rather than from vitamin and mineral supplements.</p>

<h2>Vitamins and how to get them</h2>

<p>Here’s a list of the vitamins you and your family need and how to get them.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin A</strong><br />
You get vitamin A from liver, meat, milk, eggs, and orange fruit and vegies like carrots and sweet potatoes. You need vitamin A for eyesight, skin, growth, development and immune function.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin B1 (thiamine)</strong><br />
You get vitamin B1 from fish, meat, yeast extracts (like Vegemite), wholemeal breads and fortified breakfast cereals. Vitamin B1 helps release energy from foods, so that the nervous system and muscles work properly.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)</strong><br />
You get vitamin B2 from milk, yoghurt, meat, cheese, yeast extracts, eggs, wholemeal breads and fortified breakfast cereals. Vitamin B2 helps release energy from food.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin B3 (niacin)</strong><br />
You get Vitamin B3 from meat, fish, chicken, nuts and yeast extracts. Vitamin B3 helps release energy from food.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)</strong><br />
You get vitamin B6 from meat, fish, wholegrain foods, vegetables and nuts. Vitamin B6 releases energy from protein and helps with red blood cell production and brain function.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin B12 (cobalamin)</strong><br />
You get vitamin B12 from animal foods including meat, fish, eggs and milk, and also from some fortified breakfast cereals. Vitamin B12 helps with red blood cell production and promotes growth.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)</strong><br />
You get vitamin C from fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruit,  kiwi fruit, capsicums and potatoes. Vitamin C builds collagen and helps you fight infections and absorb iron from food. It also keeps teeth, bones and gums healthy. You can lose some vitamin C when you cook food.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br />
Our bodies make most of the vitamin D we need when we get enough direct sunlight on our skin. There are small amounts in oily fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks, butter and margarine. Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium to keep bones strong and healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin E</strong><br />
You get vitamin E from sunflower and canola oils, margarine, seeds and nuts. Vitamin E boosts your immune system and helps with the development of healthy skin and eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin K</strong><br />
You get vitamin K from green leafy vegetables like broccoli and spinach, and also from eggs and beans. The bacteria in your body also make vitamin K. Vitamin K is important for helping your blood to clot.</p>

<p><strong>Folate (folic acid)</strong><br />
You get folate from green leafy vegetables, liver, legumes and wholegrain breads and cereals. Folate helps you absorb protein and form new blood cells and DNA. Getting enough folate before and during pregnancy can help prevent many neural tube defects. Cooking and processing food – for example, as part of the tinning process – reduces the amount of folate in food.</p>

<h2>Minerals and how to get them</h2>

<p>Here’s a list of the minerals you and your family need and how to get them.</p>

<p><strong>Calcium</strong><br />
You get calcium from dairy products like milk, cheese and yoghurt, fish with edible bones, like sardines and salmon, tofu and some green leafy vegetables, like kale and bok choy. Calcium builds strong bones and teeth.</p>

<p><strong>Iodine</strong><br />
You get iodine from seafood, vegetables grown in iodine-rich soil, iodised salt and bread made with iodised salt. Most bakery and supermarket bread is made with iodised salt, which will give most people enough iodine. Iodine is essential for normal growth and tissue development, and helps control the ways your cells make energy and use oxygen. Pregnant women need higher levels of iodine.</p>

<p><strong>Iron</strong><br />
You get iron from meat, liver, chicken, seafood, dried beans, egg yolks and fortified breakfast cereal. Iron is especially important for the brain and blood, and it also helps carry oxygen around the body.</p>

<p><strong>Zinc</strong><br />
You get zinc from meat, chicken, seafood, milk, seeds, tofu and wholegrain cereals. Zinc helps with growth, wound healing and immune system function.</p>

<p><strong>Other essential minerals</strong> include phosphorus, magnesium, copper, manganese and chromium.</p>

<p>Fruit and vegetables are vital sources of vitamins and minerals. You might like to read about encouraging your child to eat vegetables or see our illustrated guide to child-friendly fruit and vegies.</p>

<h2>Vitamin and mineral deficiencies</h2>

<p>If your child isn’t getting enough vitamins or minerals over a period of time, this is often called a ‘deficiency’. It means there’s a shortage of one or more vitamins and minerals in your child’s body.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin deficiencies</strong><br />
These are the most common vitamin deficiencies in Australian children:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>: vitamin D deficiency can lead to rickets and bone disease.</li>
	<li><strong>Vitamin B12</strong>: vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to a form of anaemia. Vegans can find it hard to get enough vitamin B12 in their diets and might need a supplement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mineral deficiencies</strong><br />
These are the most common mineral deficiencies in Australian children:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Calcium</strong>: not enough calcium can lead to rickets, osteopenia and osteoporosis.</li>
	<li><strong>Iodine</strong>: not enough iodine can cause goitre and other conditions like intellectual disability.</li>
	<li><strong>Iron</strong>: children are at higher risk of iron deficiency than adults, mainly because children need more iron when they go through growth spurts. They might also be low in iron if they’re vegans or vegetarians, eat a limited variety of foods, have coeliac disease, or have gastrointestinal blood loss. Adolescent girls are more at risk if they have frequent, prolonged or very heavy periods. Iron deficiency can cause tiredness, lack of concentration and pale skin.</li>
	<li><strong>Zinc</strong>: toddlers who have a limited diet for a long time, as well as vegans and vegetarians, are most likely to not get enough zinc. A zinc deficiency can slow down your child’s growth.</li>
</ul>

<p>A severe iron deficiency is called iron deficiency anaemia. Up to 6% of toddlers have iron deficiency anaemia, which can have long-term effects on brain development.</p>

<h2>How different diets can affect vitamin and mineral intake</h2>

<p>If your child has a restricted diet, you might need to be extra careful about making sure he gets all the vitamins and minerals he needs.</p>

<p>For example, <strong>vegetarian or vegan diets</strong> can make it more difficult to get enough iron. Food allergies and food intolerances can make it harder for your child to get enough calcium. With careful planning and a bit of research on other ways to get these nutrients into your child’s diet, you can get around these issues.</p>

<p>If your child has a <strong>chronic disease</strong> that affects how she absorbs food – like coeliac disease or Crohn’s disease – the vitamins and minerals in a standard healthy diet might not be enough for her. Your GP or a dietitian can help you work out what you need to do to.</p>

<p>Children who eat lots of <strong>‘sometimes’ foods</strong>, like sweet drinks, chips and cakes, might fill up on those and not have enough room for the foods that give them essential vitamins and minerals. You could try limiting sometimes foods to special occasions.</p>

<h2>Vitamin and mineral supplements</h2>

<p>Our bodies need only tiny amounts of vitamins and minerals – <strong>more isn’t necessarily better</strong>.</p>

<p>Large amounts of some vitamins can actually be dangerous. For example, vitamin A builds up in the body if it’s taken in excessive amounts. Large doses of some minerals can also cause problems.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned that your child’s diet could be leaving him low on some vitamins or minerals, and he isn’t able to eat more food containing the vitamins and minerals he needs, see your doctor or a dietitian for advice. They might suggest that your child takes an appropriate supplement.</p>

<p>Note that vitamin and mineral supplements can interact with medications. If your child takes a vitamin or mineral supplement and your GP is prescribing medication for your child, it’s important to let the GP know about the supplement.</p>",12716,1,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2856, 2861, 2866, 2871, 2876, 2881, 2886, 2891, 2896, 2901, 2906, 2911, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2931, 2936, 2941, 2946, 2951, 1241, 2956",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/healthy-lifestyle/nutrients/vitamins-minerals</p>,en,published
1561,Carbohydrates and GI,"Our bodies get energy by turning carbohydrates into simple sugars. Different carbohydrates are broken down into sugars at different rates, and glycaemic index (GI) is how we measure this. Low-GI foods give your child longer-lasting energy.","<h2>What are carbohydrates?</h2>

<p>Carbohydrates are natural substances that contain oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. We need carbohydrates to give our bodies energy – to ‘get up and go’.</p>

<p>We get carbohydrates from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>starchy foods like bread, pasta, rice, cereals and potato</li>
	<li>fruit and vegetables</li>
	<li>dairy products like milk and yoghurt.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also get carbohydrates from table sugar and sugary foods like ice-cream, biscuits, soft drinks and cakes.</p>

<h2>What is glycaemic index (GI)?</h2>

<p>When we eat carbohydrates, our digestive system breaks them down into simple sugars – mainly glucose. Our cells use this glucose to produce energy.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates break down into glucose at different rates. This means that different carbohydrates – that is, different foods – cause glucose levels in our blood to go up and down at different rates.</p>

<p>The <strong>glycaemic index (GI)</strong> measures the effect that carbohydrates in food have on blood glucose levels. GI ranks foods on a scale from 0-100:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Foods with a <strong>low GI</strong> (0-55) cause a steady and long-lasting rise and fall in blood glucose levels. This is because the carbohydrates in these foods break down slowly.</li>
	<li>Foods with an <strong>intermediate GI</strong> (56-69) cause a moderate rise and fall in blood glucose because their carbohydrates break down at a moderate rate.</li>
	<li>Foods with a <strong>high GI </strong>(70-100) cause a large and fast rise and fall in blood glucose. This is because the carbohydrates in these foods break down quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Low-GI foods are broken down slowly for steady, long-lasting energy. If your child eats more low-GI foods than high-GI foods throughout the day, it’ll help keep her energy levels steady.</p>

<h2>Foods and GI</h2>

<p>The following is a <strong>guide only</strong> to some foods and their GI values. Different varieties and brands of food can have different GI values, so it’s best to speak to a dietitian if you’d like more information.</p>

<p><strong>Low-GI symbol</strong>When you’re looking for low-GI food, it’s also a good idea to look for the Glycemic Index Foundation’s Low-GI symbol. Many foods are now marked with this symbol. Foods with the symbol must be low GI and meet strict standards for kilojoules, fat, saturated fat, sodium and, where appropriate, fibre and calcium.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> </h2>

<p> </p>

<h2>Benefits of low-GI food</h2>

<p>Low-GI foods are good because they give your child <strong>longer-lasting energy</strong>, which can help him concentrate better and keep him going for longer.</p>

<p>If your child does endurance sports like long-distance running, low-GI foods help keep her energy levels up.</p>

<p>Low-GI foods also keep your child feeling fuller for longer. This can help him maintain a healthy weight.</p>

<h2>Using GI to plan healthy family eating</h2>

<p>As well as making sure your family eats plenty of fresh food from the five healthy food groups, it’s good to think about GI when you’re planning what your family will eat.</p>

<p><strong>Getting a balance of high and low GI </strong><br />
Low-GI foods are generally healthier than high-GI foods. This is because low-GI foods make blood glucose (sugar) levels go up and down slowly and steadily. This means your child is fuller for longer, so she’s less likely to snack between meals and overeat.</p>

<p>It’s OK to eat some high-GI foods occasionally. The trick is to include a low-GI food for your family at each meal and snack.</p>

<p>High-GI foods and low-GI foods combine in your child’s body for a medium GI – they balance each other out.</p>

<p><strong>Quantity matters </strong><br />
When you’re choosing which foods to offer your family, it’s important to think about not just the GI rating, but how much of these foods you’re eating – that is, portion size. This is sometimes called the glycaemic load (GL).</p>

<p>A big serving of a high-GI food like potatoes or lollies will have a big impact on your child’s blood glucose levels. So if your child has small serves of high-GI foods and larger, more frequent serves of low-GI foods, this can balance things out.</p>

<p><strong>When to eat your carbohydrates </strong><br />
There’s no hard and fast rule about when to eat carbohydrates, but each day it’s good for your child to have three regular meals and some nutritious snacks. This way, your child gets an even spread of carbohydrates across the day.</p>

<p>This keeps your child’s blood glucose levels stable and his energy levels steady. This is essential for adults and children with diabetes, but it’s also important for people who want to keep up good general health.</p>

<p>Your child’s total carbohydrate needs depend on how much physical activity your child does and how old she is.</p>

<h2>Making the change to low-GI foods</h2>

<p>Switching to low-GI food is easy. Chances are your family won’t notice the difference – at least not all of the time.</p>

<p>By swapping at least half your carbohydrate food choices for lower-GI options, your whole family can reap the benefits.</p>

<p>For example, you can swap:</p>

<ul>
	<li>white or wholemeal bread for <strong>multigrain breads</strong>, pita bread, or genuine sourdough bread</li>
	<li>processed breakfast cereals like Rice Bubbles® or Corn Flakes® for <strong>unrefined breakfast cereals</strong> like traditional (not instant) porridge, or cereals with low GI like Weet-Bix® or All Bran®</li>
	<li>plain biscuits and crackers for <strong>biscuits made with dried fruit and wholegrains</strong></li>
	<li>cakes and muffins for cakes and <strong>muffins made with fruit, oats and wholegrains</strong></li>
	<li>tropical fruits – for example, watermelon – for <strong>cooler-climate fruits </strong>like apples, lady finger bananas, pears, peaches, grapes, nectarines, oranges and mandarines</li>
	<li>white potato for low-GI potatoes like Carisma™, and sweet potato, corn, pasta or legumes like lentils, beans and chickpeas</li>
	<li>most rices for <strong>Basmati, Doongara or Mahatma rice</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some foods with lots of fibre can help slow the breakdown of carbohydrates, giving it a lower GI. By choosing wholegrain foods or keeping the skin on vegies like potatoes and carrots, you can get your family eating more low-GI foods.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions about low-GI foods</h2>

<p><strong>What if my child doesn’t like low-GI foods?</strong><br />
Not all of your child’s food needs to be low GI. Low-GI and high-GI foods combine to give a medium GI – they balance each other out. Ideally, at least half of your child’s carbohydrates will come from low-GI foods he enjoys.</p>

<p>You can try to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>set a good example and show your child that you enjoy eating lots of different low-GI foods</li>
	<li>keep offering low-GI foods at mealtimes and encourage your child to taste them – it might take up to 10-15 times before she accepts new foods and flavours</li>
	<li>keep lower-GI foods as ‘everyday’ foods and high-GI options as ‘sometimes’ foods.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chocolate has a low-GI value. Does this make it a good food choice? </strong><br />
Many foods high in fat have a lower-GI value – chocolate is a good example of this. Low GI doesn’t cancel out the problems of high fat – you need to look at the whole food.</p>

<p>So you and your family should try to have foods like chocolate as occasional treats only.</p>

<p><strong>What’s the best food for my child to eat before sport?</strong><br />
Carbohydrate foods are the best source of energy before sport. Low-GI breakfast foods – like traditional porridge, wholegrain cereal or toast – will give your child sustained energy on the day of the game.</p>

<h2>GI and diabetes</h2>

<p>If your child has type-1 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, his blood glucose levels might rise above a normal level more quickly than other people’s.</p>

<p>Eating low-GI foods can help your child manage her blood glucose levels. And eating moderate amounts of low-GI foods regularly over the day will help her keep consistent blood glucose levels.</p>

<p>If your child has a medical condition like diabetes, it’s important to talk with your GP, dietitian or specialist before making any changes to his eating.</p>

<p>There’s no link between eating sugar and developing diabetes. But eating too much added sugar can contribute to weight gain, and being overweight increases the risk of developing type-2 diabetes.</p>",12716,1,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2961, 2966, 2971, 2981, 3006, 3026, 3036, 3041, 3046, 3051, 3056",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/healthy-lifestyle/nutrients/carbohydrates-gi</p>,en,published
1566,Iodine: what you need to know,"Iodine is important for growth and development, especially in babies and children. Grown-ups need it too. To see whether you and your family are getting enough, start by checking your diet.","<h2>Iodine: what is it?</h2>

<p>Iodine is an essential nutrient for humans, but we need only a small amount of it for good health.</p>

<p>Iodine occurs naturally in the sea and in some soils.</p>

<p>Iodine is also found in marine life (including fish, prawns and seaweed), some plants grown in iodine-rich soil, and in the products of animals that have grazed on soil with iodine in it.</p>

<p>Iodine is added to some foods, like salt and commercially baked bread.</p>

<h2>Why we need iodine</h2>

<p>Our thyroid glands need iodine to produce the hormones that control metabolism, growth and development.</p>

<p>If children and grown-ups don’t get enough iodine in their diets, they might develop <strong>iodine deficiency</strong>.This can cause the thyroid gland to increase in size. An enlarged thyroid gland, or goitre, can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>affect hormone production</li>
	<li>cause swallowing and breathing difficulties</li>
	<li>lead to hypothyroidism, which can cause problems like weight gain, dry skin, hair loss, tiredness, intolerance to cold and depression</li>
	<li>result in stunted growth, intellectual impairment and a lower level of intelligence measured by IQ.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Iodine, pregnancy and breastfeeding</h2>

<p>During pregnancy, a woman’s thyroid gland has to work extra hard. This is because the hormones it produces help the growth of her unborn baby’s brain and nervous system.</p>

<p>Because a pregnant woman’s thyroid gland is working harder, she needs extra iodine so she doesn’t become iodine deficient.</p>

<p>Severe iodine deficiency in a pregnant woman might lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or intellectual disability in her baby.</p>

<p>After birth, breastfed babies depend on breastmilk as a source of iodine, which keeps their brains and nervous systems developing. This means that iodine deficiency in breastfeeding mothers can also be a risk for babies.</p>

<p>If you’re pregnant, trying to become pregnant or breastfeeding, it’s recommended that you take an iodine supplement of 150 micrograms (μg) per day. If you have any pre-existing thyroid problems, check with your doctor before taking a supplement.</p>

<h2>Sources of iodine</h2>

<p>Including the following foods in your family’s diet each week will help to ensure that you and your children are getting enough iodine:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Packaged bread</strong>: note that organic bread, salt-free bread, unpackaged bread and bread mixes for making bread at home might not contain iodine, so either check the food label or ask at the point of sale.</li>
	<li><strong>Seafood</strong>: experts recommend 2-3 meals of regular seafood per week. If you’re pregnant, you should be careful when choosing fish. That’s because some fish – like flake, swordfish and ling – have higher levels of mercury than others. Tinned salmon and seaweed are the best food sources of iodine.</li>
	<li><strong>Eggs, vegetables, meat and dairy products</strong>: note that the amount of iodine in these foods varies a lot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vegans might need to consider iodine supplements or iodine-rich vegan foods like <strong>fortified</strong> soy milks and seaweed.</p>

<p>Iodised salt is a rich source of iodine and has replaced non-iodised salt in all packaged breads sold in Australia. Bread fortified with iodised salt can provide enough iodine for most people, without the need for extra iodised salt in your diet. Too much salt isn’t good for your health, so it’s best to get iodine from other sources.</p>

<h2>How much iodine people need</h2>

<p>The Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand recommend the following daily intake of iodine:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Young babies aged 0-6 months need 90 μg per day.</li>
	<li>Older babies aged 7-12 months need 110 μg per day.</li>
	<li>Children aged 1-8 years need 90 μg per day.</li>
	<li>Children aged 9-13 years need 120 μg per day.</li>
	<li>Teenagers aged 14-18 years and adults who are neither pregnant nor breastfeeding need 150 μg per day.</li>
	<li>Pregnant women and women trying to get pregnant need 220 μg per day.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding women need 270 μg per day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why some people don’t get enough iodine</h2>

<p>Some  children don’t get quite enough iodine.</p>

<p>This might be because some areas have low iodine levels in the soil, meaning vegetables grown in these areas don’t have much iodine.</p>

<p>Many families now cut salt out of their diets, leading to lower iodine intake. Even when they add salt to their meals, it’s often in the form of regular salt or sea salt, rather than iodised table salt.</p>

<h2>Too much iodine</h2>

<p>It’s possible to have too much iodine, but consuming a dangerously high level of it is actually quite hard. For example, your child would need to eat 1 kg of cheese or 25 whole boiled eggs or drink 5 glasses of milk in one sitting to have too much.</p>

<p>Some people are more sensitive to excessive iodine intake, which might cause difficulties with their thyroid glands. Some medications and supplements might also contain high doses of iodine.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned about whether your child and family is getting enough iodine, it’s a good idea to talk with a health professional, like your GP or a dietitian.</p>",12716,1,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50",59,60,2916,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/healthy-lifestyle/nutrients/iodine</p>,en,published
1571,Food labels: nutritional information and ingredients,Food labels help us to make healthy and safe food choices. But there’s so much nutritional information on food labels that they can sometimes be confusing. Here’s how to read food labels and work out how healthy a food is – or isn’t.,"<h2>Food labels and nutritional information panels: what and where they are</h2>

<p>Food labels are included on all food products, except for very small packets and fresh foods like fruit, vegetables and local bakery or organic products.</p>

<p>Food labels tell you what <strong>ingredients or additives</strong> are in the food. They give you nutritional information about the food and food storage instructions. They also tell you who manufactured the food.</p>

<p>Nutritional information panels (NIPs) are a part of the food label. These tell you what nutrients the food contains and how much of each nutrient there is.</p>

<p>When you buy a packaged food product, have a look at the <strong>back of the packet</strong>. You should be able to see a box with a heading like ‘Nutritional information’. Under the heading, you’ll see categories like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>serving size</li>
	<li>energy</li>
	<li>protein</li>
	<li>fat</li>
	<li>carbohydrates</li>
	<li>sugars</li>
	<li>dietary fibre</li>
	<li>sodium.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nutritional information on food labels helps you work out how healthy a food is. But keep in mind that some of the healthiest foods can be unlabelled – fresh fruits and vegetables, wholegrain breads, nuts, lentils, beans, fresh meat and fish.</p>

<h2>Ingredients on food labels</h2>

<p>In Australia, food manufacturers must be truthful on their food labels.</p>

<p>A food label can include <strong>only the ingredients that are in the food product</strong>. For example, strawberry yoghurt must contain strawberries.</p>

<p>The label also has to list the <strong>amount of the ingredient that’s in the food</strong>. This information is in the ingredients list, where it will be written as a percentage – for example, ‘strawberries (20%)’.</p>

<p>All ingredients must be listed in descending order by weight, including added water. The ingredient listed first is <strong>present in the largest amount</strong>. So if sugar is the first ingredient it means that sugar is the main ingredient and the product is high in sugar. The ingredient listed last is present in the smallest amount.</p>

<h2>Nutritional informational panels</h2>

<p>All foods have to list <strong>seven food components</strong> on their nutritional information panels – energy (kilojoules), protein, total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrates, sugars and sodium. Manufacturers might decide to include other nutrients, like fibre and calcium, too.</p>

<p>Comparing the nutritional information on different food products helps you work out the healthiest choice. All you need to do is see which one has <strong>lower saturated fat, lower sodium, lower sugar and higher fibre.</strong></p>

<p>When you’re comparing two products, look at the <strong>‘per 100 gm’ information</strong> on each, rather than the ‘per serving’ information. This way you can compare the same thing on each product.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2> </h2>

<p>Please check the image on Raising Children site and see if it can be embedded.</p>

<p>The link for the image is 'https://raisingchildren.net.au/__data/assets/image/0029/41789/food-labels.gif' and the alt text for the image is 'Nutrition panel'.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Things to look out for on food labels: energy, fat, sugar and salt</h2>

<p><strong>Energy</strong><br />
Energy is listed on the panel as<strong> kilojoules (kj)</strong>. Fats, protein and carbohydrates all provide your body with the energy or kilojoules you need to function and do your daily activities. When comparing similar foods, lower energy usually means lower fat or sugar, which means that the food is a better choice for most people.</p>

<p><strong>Fat, sugar and salt in disguise</strong><br />
Manufacturers can list fat, sugar or salt content under different names. This means that these food components might seem ‘hidden’ on the nutritional information panel or ingredient list. These components might go by different names – but whatever they’re called, high fat, sugar and salt content generally means the food is less healthy.</p>

<p><strong>Fat</strong> might also be called beef fat, butter, shortening, coconut, palm oil, copha, cream, dripping, lard, mayonnaise, sour cream, vegetable oils and fats, hydrogenated oils, full cream milk powder, egg or mono/di/triglycerides.</p>

<p><strong>Sugar </strong>might be called brown sugar, corn syrup, dextrose, disaccharides, fructose, glucose, golden syrup, honey, fruit juice concentrate, fruit syrup, lactose, malt, maltose, mannitol, maple syrup, molasses, monosaccharides, raw sugar, sorbitol or xylitol.</p>

<p><strong>Salt</strong> might be listed as baking powder, booster, celery salt, garlic salt, sodium, meat or yeast extract, onion salt, MSG, rock salt, sea salt, sodium bicarbonate, sodium metabisulphite, sodium nitrate, nitrate or stock cubes.</p>

<p>Some packaged foods have a health star rating. This system looks at how nutritious foods are and rates foods from half a star to five stars. The more stars a food has, the healthier it is.</p>

<h2>Food additives</h2>

<p>Many foods contain food additives. There are strict guidelines about the way food additives are used in foods and labelled on food products. All <strong>food additives must be shown on the ingredients list</strong> – for example, thickener (1442). The label must say if an additive is based on a potential allergen – for example, wheat thickener (1442).</p>

<p>You can get a list of food additive names, numbers and common uses from the Food Standards Australia New Zealand food additives webpage.</p>

<p>A very small number of people are sensitive to some food additives, most commonly artificial colours, preservatives and flavour enhancers. If you think your child might have a sensitivity, see your GP or dietitian to talk about food allergies and food intolerances.</p>

<h2>Food allergy information</h2>

<p>Just nine foods cause 90% of all food allergic reactions – peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, cow’s milk, hen’s eggs, soybeans, sesame and wheat. <strong>If these ingredients are in a food product, manufacturers must say so</strong>, no matter how small the amount.</p>

<p>The information can be stated in a few different ways. For example, if you’re checking a product for egg, you might see:</p>

<ul>
	<li>albumin (egg)</li>
	<li>egg albumin</li>
	<li>contains egg – at the end of the ingredients list</li>
	<li>sugar, chocolate, <strong>eggs</strong> – in bold type in the ingredients list.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>‘May contain traces of’</strong><br />
Manufacturers might include this warning if a food is made on the same equipment as, or close to, other foods that contain potential food allergens.</p>

<p>It’s voluntary for manufacturers to use ‘may contain’ statements, so a product that doesn’t have a ‘may contain’ statement might not be safer than one that does.</p>

<p>It’s important to talk to your GP or dietitian about this issue if your child has a severe food allergy.</p>

<h2>Double-checking nutrition and health claims</h2>

<p>Nutrition claims on food labels and in food advertising – like ‘low-fat’ on a packet of chips – can be confusing and misleading. Nutrition claims might grab your attention, but it’s always a good idea to <strong>look at the nutritional information panel.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some points to bear in mind about common nutrition and health claims:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cholesterol free: a product might be 100% cholesterol free, but still contain fat.</li>
	<li>Fat free: for a manufacturer to make this claim, the product must have less than 0.15% fat.</li>
	<li>Lite or light: this might just mean the food is light in colour, flavour or texture. You should still check the fat content on the nutritional information panel.</li>

<h2>‘Use by’ and ‘Best before’ dates</h2>

<p>All foods with a shelf life of less than two years must have a date on them that tells you when the manufacturer advises the food will either be unsafe to eat or not as good to eat:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Use by </strong>is for perishable foods like meat, fish and dairy. This is the date that tells you when a food is ‘off’. It’s illegal for shops to sell food past its ‘Use by’ date.</li>
	<li><strong>Best before </strong>tells you the date when the food will still be safe to eat but might not be of the best quality anymore.</li>
	<li><strong>Baked on </strong>or <strong>packed on </strong>is the date the food was manufactured or packed. This tells you how fresh it is. You might see this on foods like bread and meat.</li>

1576,Healthy food for babies and toddlers: the five food groups,"Babies and toddlers need foods from all five healthy food groups: vegetables, fruit, grain foods, dairy and protein.Healthy foods have nutrients that are important for growth, development and learning.Your child should avoid foods high in salt, saturated fat and sugar, foods low in fibre and nutrients, and drinks with caffeine and lots of sugar.","<h2>What is healthy food for babies and toddlers?</h2>

<p>Healthy food for babies and toddlers includes a wide variety of fresh foods from the <strong>five healthy food groups</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>vegetables</li>
	<li>fruit</li>
	<li>grains</li>
	<li>dairy</li>
	<li>protein.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each food group has different nutrients, which your child’s body needs to grow and work properly. That’s why we need to eat a range of foods from across all five food groups.</p>

<p>Going from drinking breastmilk or infant formula to eating family meals takes time, and your baby won’t be eating food from all five food groups straight away. Starting your baby on solids is the first step. Once your baby has started eating solids, try to include foods from a variety of groups at each meal.</p>

<h2>Fruit and vegetables</h2>

<p>Fruit and vegies give your child energy, vitamins, anti-oxidants, fibre and water. They help protect your baby against diseases later in life, including diseases like heart disease, stroke and some cancers.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to offer your baby fruit and vegetables at every meal and for snacks. Try to choose fruit and vegies of different colours, textures and tastes, both fresh and cooked.</p>

<p>Wash fruit to remove dirt or chemicals, and leave the skin on, because the skin contains nutrients too.</p>

<p>If your child seems to be ‘fussy’ about eating fruit and vegies, it doesn’t mean he’ll never like them. Did you know that if your child sees you eating a wide range of vegetables and fruit, he’s more likely to try them too?</p>

<h2>Grain foods</h2>

<p>Grain foods include <strong>bread, pasta, noodles, breakfast cereals, couscous, rice, corn, quinoa, polenta, oats and barley</strong>. These foods give your child the energy she needs to grow, develop and learn.</p>

<p>Grain foods with a low glycaemic index, like wholegrain pasta and breads, will give your child longer-lasting energy and keep him feeling fuller for longer.</p>

<h2>Dairy</h2>

<p>Key dairy foods are <strong>milk, cheese and yoghurt</strong>. These foods are high in protein and calcium.</p>

<p>Dairy foods can be introduced from around six months of age. But make sure that breastmilk or infant formula is your baby’s main drink until around 12 months of age. After that, she can start drinking full-fat cow’s milk.</p>

<p>Because children in this age group are growing so quickly and need lots of energy, they need full-fat dairy products until they turn two.</p>

<h2>Protein</h2>

<p>Protein-rich foods include <strong>lean meat, fish, chicken, eggs, beans, lentils, chickpeas, tofu and nuts</strong>. These foods are important for your child’s growth and muscle development.</p>

<p>These foods also contain other useful vitamins and minerals like iron, zinc, vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. Iron and omega-3 fatty acids from red meat and oily fish are particularly important for your child’s brain development and learning.</p>

<p>Have a look at our illustrated dietary guidelines for children 2-3 years for more information about daily food portions and recommendations. You can also speak to a dietitian if you have concerns about your child’s eating.</p>

<h2>Healthy drinks</h2>

<p><strong>Water is the healthiest drink</strong> for children over 12 months. It’s also the cheapest. Most tap water is fortified with fluoride for strong teeth too.</p>

<p>From six months, breastfed and formula-fed babies can have small amounts of cooled boiled tap water from a cup.</p>

<h2>Foods and drinks to avoid</h2>

<p>Your child should avoid ‘sometimes’ foods. These foods include <strong>fast food and junk food</strong> like hot chips, potato chips, dim sims, pies, burgers and takeaway pizza. These foods also include cakes, chocolate, lollies, biscuits, doughnuts and pastries.</p>

<p>These foods are high in salt, saturated fat and sugar, and low in fibre and nutrients. Eating too much of these foods can increase the risk of childhood obesity and conditions like type-2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Your child should also avoid <strong>sweet drinks</strong> like fruit juice, cordials, sports drinks, flavoured waters, soft drinks and flavoured milks. Sweet drinks are high in sugar and low in nutrients. They can cause weight gain, obesity and tooth decay. These drinks fill your child up and can make him less hungry for healthy meals. And if children start on these drinks when they’re young, it can kick off an unhealthy lifelong habit.</p>

<p>Foods and drinks with <strong>caffeine</strong> aren’t recommended for children, because caffeine stops the body from absorbing calcium well. Caffeine is also a stimulant, which means it gives children artificial energy. These foods and drinks include coffee, tea, energy drinks and chocolate.</p>

<p><strong>Healthy alternatives for snacks and desserts</strong><br />
It’s fine to offer your child <strong>snacks</strong>, but try to make sure they’re healthy – for example, grated or thinly sliced carrot.</p>

<p>The same goes for <strong>dessert</strong> at the end of a meal. Sliced fruit or yoghurt is the healthiest option. If you want to serve something special, try homemade banana bread. Save the seriously sweet stuff, like cakes and chocolate, for special occasions like birthdays.</p>

<p>The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating says that both children and adults should avoid or limit sometimes food. It’s best to save these foods for special occasions.</p>",12716,1,"46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3141, 3146, 3151",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/nutritious-food/babies-toddlers-food-groups</p>,en,published
1581,Healthy drinks for kids,"Water and cow’s milk are the best drinks for children over 12 months and teenagers.Unhealthy drinks include soft drinks, cordials, fruit juices, mineral waters, energy drinks, sports drinks, tea and coffee.Sweet drinks can lead to overweight, obesity and tooth decay in children and teenagers.","<h2>Healthy drinks under six months</h2>

<p>Under six months, babies need only breastmilk or infant formula. Breastmilk or formula is food and drink for babies at this age.</p>

<h2>Healthy drinks at 6-12 months</h2>

<p>You can give breastfed and formula-fed babies small amounts of cooled boiled tap water from a cup from six months on.</p>

<p>Drinking water from a cup – rather than a bottle – helps your child learn how to handle a cup.</p>

<p>Giving your baby drinks other than water, breastmilk or formula in the first 12 months can stop him from getting enough essential nutrients.</p>

<h2>Healthy drinks at 12 months</h2>

<p>After 12 months, you can give your baby <strong>pasteurised, unflavoured, full-fat cow’s milk</strong> to drink if she’s eating a balanced diet.</p>

<p>Reduced-fat milk isn’t recommended for children under two years. This is because toddlers need the nutrients in full-fat milk to meet their energy, growth and development needs.</p>

<p>You can keep breastfeeding after 12 months for as long as it suits you and your child. If your child has been formula fed, he doesn’t need formula after 12 months.</p>

<p>Your child can also have <strong>tap water</strong>, but there’s no need to boil it after 12 months.</p>

<h2>Healthy drinks for toddlers, preschoolers and older children</h2>

<p>For toddlers and older children, <strong>tap water and milk</strong> are the best drinks.</p>

<p>When your child drinks plenty of water regularly throughout the day, she stays hydrated. This is especially important in hot weather or when your child is running around a lot. Drinking plenty of water can also help her avoid constipation.</p>

<h2>Encouraging your child to drink more water</h2>

<p>Here are some <strong>tips to encourage your child to drink and enjoy water</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Get everyone in the family drinking water as their main drink. When your children see you doing it, they’re likely to do it too.</li>
	<li>Make water easily available by giving younger children water bottles at home and showing older children how to get their own water from the tap.</li>
	<li>Have water on the table at meals and snack times.</li>
	<li>Keep chilled water in a jug in the fridge. You could try adding ice cubes or pieces of frozen fruit to make it more appealing for your child.</li>
	<li>Take filled water bottles when you go out with your child.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unhealthy drinks: fruit juice</h2>

<p>Fruit juices have high levels of sugar and acid and don’t have much fibre. Children don’t need extra sugar – but they do need fibre. That’s why it’s better for them to eat fruit, rather than drink juice.</p>

<p>If your child drinks juice, it should be limited to ½ cup per day. It’s a good idea to mix the fruit juice with some water or ice, and even sneak in a few vegetables. Mixing the fruit in a blender instead of a juicer will keep the fruit fibre in the juice.</p>

<p>It’s best for children to eat whole fruit and drink plain tap water or milk. Water is always better than fruit juice, because it satisfies thirst but doesn’t contain sugar.</p>

<h2>Unhealthy drinks: soft drinks, cordial, sports drinks, energy drinks, flavoured milk</h2>

<p><strong>Soft drinks, cordial, sports drinks and energy drinks</strong> have lots of sugar and virtually no nutrients.</p>

<p>They’re not good for children, because they take the place of other more nourishing foods and drinks and can cause weight gain or tooth decay. Many soft drinks also contain caffeine, which could make your child extremely excited, then exhausted. Caffeine can also affect your child’s sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Mineral waters</strong> can be high in certain minerals that can stress your child’s kidneys. Flavoured varieties can also be high in sugar.</p>

<p><strong>Flavoured milk</strong> and breakfast milk drinks are high in added sugar, so it’s better to offer your children plain milk instead.</p>

<h2>Unhealthy drinks: tea and coffee</h2>

<p><strong>Tea and coffee</strong> contain caffeine, which can affect your child’s sleep, behaviour and development.</p>

<p>Some <strong>herbal teas</strong> might contain compounds that can be harmful for children. Check with your health professional if you have questions about herbal tea for your child.</p>",12716,1,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3161, 3166, 3171, 3176, 3181, 3186, 3196, 3201, 3206, 3211, 3216, 3221, 3226, 3231, 3236, 3241, 3246, 3251, 3261, 3271, 3276, 3281, 3286, 3291, 3296, 3301, 3306, 3311, 3326, 3336",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/nutritious-food/healthy-drinks</p>,en,published

Eating vegetables can also protect him against chronic diseases.Children under eight years should have 2-4½ serves of vegetables each day.Help your child eat lots of vegetables by setting a good example. Persistence and praise can help too.,"<h2>Why eating vegetables is important for children</h2>

<p>Vegetables give your child energy, vitamins, anti-oxidants, fibre and water. They help protect your child against diseases later in life, including heart disease, stroke and some cancers. <strong>A healthy diet means eating lots of vegetables</strong>, plus a wide variety of foods from the other main food groups.</p>

<p>The Australian Dietary Guidelines say that children aged:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1-2 years should have 2-3 serves of vegetables each day</li>
	<li>2-3 years should have 2½ serves of vegetables each day</li>
	<li>4-8 years should have 4½ serves of vegetables each day.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child finds it hard to eat enough vegetables, it’s important to keep working on it. If you help your child develop healthy eating habits now, it sets up healthy habits for life.</p>

<p>Our <strong>tips below</strong> can help you get more vegetables into your family’s diet.</p>

<p>For more information you can read our articles on healthy food for babies and toddlers, healthy food for preschoolers and healthy food for school-age children.</p>

<h2>Tip 1: set a good example with vegetables</h2>

<p>Your child learns about food choices from you, so the best way to encourage your child to eat vegetables is to let her see you eating and enjoying them yourself.</p>

<p>Family meals are a good time to teach your child about healthy eating, including eating vegetables. Family foods like stir-fries, curries, roasts and pastas all taste great with more vegies. A bowl of salad on the side is a quick and tasty option too. If your child sees you and his siblings filling plates with vegies to enjoy, he’ll probably want to copy you.</p>

<h2>Tip 2: keep trying with vegetables</h2>

<p>It’s normal for children to say they don’t like vegetables when they first taste them. If your child says she doesn’t like vegetables – or doesn’t like a new vegetable – keep offering them to her at mealtimes. Also keep encouraging her to try and taste them.</p>

<p>Your child will probably change his mind about vegetables eventually. Some children need to try a new food up to <strong>10 times</strong> before they accept it, and another 10 times before they decide they like it.</p>

<h2>Tip 3: use praise when your child tries vegetables</h2>

<p>If you praise your child each time she eats or tries vegetables, she’s more likely to eat vegetables again. Praise works best when you tell your child exactly what she did well – for example, ‘Peri, I love the way you tasted your pumpkin and broccoli!’</p>

<p>Try not to let praise become the focus of the meal, though. Your aim is to encourage your child to eat vegetables because he likes them, not because he wants praise and rewards from you.</p>

<p>Punishing your child for not eating vegetables can turn vegetables into a negative thing for your child. If your child refuses to eat, it’s best to take her meal away after about 20 minutes. Try not to make a big deal about it – just try again another time.</p>

<p>It’s not a good idea to say things like, ‘If you eat your broccoli, you can have some ice-cream for dessert’. This can make your child more interested in treats than healthy foods. It also suggests that eating the healthy food is a chore. And it can encourage overeating.</p>

<h2>Tip 4: get your child involved in cooking with vegetables</h2>

<p>If you get your child involved in planning and cooking family meals with vegetables, he’s more likely to want to eat the vegetables he’s helped to prepare.</p>

<p>For example, you could let your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>choose vegetables for dinner when you do the shopping</li>
	<li>put chopped vegetables in the steamer or saucepan before you cook them</li>
	<li>arrange sliced capsicum, tomato and mushroom on a pizza base</li>
	<li>wash and toss salad leaves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Older children can help with grating or chopping vegetables when you feel they can safely handle sharper kitchen tools.</p>

<p>Take children shopping with you when you can. Seeing lots of different vegetables can make children more curious and interested to try them.</p>

<h2>Tip 5: offer vegetables as snacks</h2>

<p>Vegetables make great snacks. If you stock up on vegetables for snacks and limit unhealthy snacks in your home, your child will be more likely to choose vegetables when she’s hungry.</p>

<p>Here are some vegetable snack ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep a container of chopped vegetables, like cucumber, carrots or capsicum, in the fridge. A bowl of cherry tomatoes on the bench is another option.</li>
	<li>Offer older children frozen baby peas, but note that these can be a choking hazard for younger children.</li>
	<li>Serve vegetable sticks with dip, natural yoghurt, cheese or wholemeal pita bread.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tip 6: go for vegetable variety, taste and fun</h2>

<p>Try to choose vegies of different shapes, colours, textures and tastes – the more variety there is, the more likely it is your child will find something that he’s interested in eating. If you serve new vegetables with food your child enjoys, the entire focus of the meal isn’t on new vegetables.</p>

<p>Remember that taste matters. For example, you could try roasting vegies with fresh herbs and lemon juice or use finely sliced broccoli in a stir-fry or on a pizza. This will probably appeal more to your child than large steamed pieces of vegetables.</p>

<p>You can have fun with vegetables too, especially with younger children. You might like to make a vegetable face for a snack plate – grated carrot for hair, cherry tomatoes for eyes, a bean for a nose and capsicum strips for a mouth.</p>

<p>Check out our recipes for toddlers, recipes for preschoolers and recipes for school-age children for more healthy snack and meal ideas.</p>

<h2>Tip 7: get vegetables into meals in other ways</h2>

<p>In the short term, you can disguise vegetables in foods you know your child likes to eat. For example, you could include pureed or grated vegetables in pasta sauce or soups.</p>

<p>This won’t change your child’s behaviour and thinking about vegetables, though, so it’s also important to regularly give your child vegetables in their original form. When you do this, your child has the chance to get familiar with and learn to like different tastes and textures.</p>

<p>If you’re worried about your child’s eating habits, make an appointment to see a dietitian.</p>",12716,1,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3346, 3351, 3356, 3361",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/nutritious-food/vegetables</p>,en,published
1591,Making family meals enjoyable: six tips,Regular family meals let you catch up with each other and enjoy healthy food together.Set aside regular time for family meals.Get everyone involved in choosing and preparing family meals.Reward behaviour like using good manners and trying new foods.,"<h2>Benefits of family meals</h2>

<p>Family life is busy, and preparing and sharing family meals together takes time. But when you can manage it, regular family meals are worth the effort.</p>

<p>Whether it’s nightly dinners or a special Sunday lunch, family meals are perfect times to <strong>catch up, connect and communicate with each other</strong>. This can be especially important for busy older children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Your child can also <strong>learn a lot about food, eating and family traditions</strong> by watching what you do at mealtimes. For example, eating with the rest of the family helps younger children learn to eat the same healthy food as everyone else. It can encourage picky eaters to try new foods.</p>

<p>And you can use family meals to <strong>model the behaviour you want to see</strong> when your family comes together. This is about learning to use spoons, forks and chopsticks for younger children. It’s also about things like taking turns to talk and listening while others share their news.</p>

<p>Children and teenagers who regularly eat meals with their families do better in lots of ways, from mental and physical health to school results.</p>

<h2>Six ways to make family meals enjoyable</h2>

<p><strong>1. Set aside regular times to eat together</strong><br />
When you put these times in your weekly schedule, you’re all more likely to be there. Having your meal at a table, with the television and phones turned off, can make this time even more special.</p>

<p><strong>2. Reduce the rush</strong><br />
If you allow around 20-30 minutes for family meals, it gives your children plenty of time to eat. They’ll have the chance to try new foods and develop good eating habits. This also gives you time to relax, chat and enjoy your family.</p>

<p>If you have a toddler who finds it hard to sit still for 20 minutes, let him move around a bit. But it’s best to let your toddler eat only when he’s sitting at the table.</p>

<p><strong>3. Get everyone involved</strong><br />
Involving your children in choosing and preparing family meals increases the chance that they’ll eat it. It can also encourage fussy eaters to try new food.</p>

<p>Even young children can help with preparing family meals. For example, they can wash fruit and vegies, or toss salads. They can also help by setting the table and even decorating it with flowers.</p>

<p>Older children and teenagers might enjoy finding new recipes and cooking meals for the family – for example, once a week or fortnight. This helps share the responsibility for meal preparation and gives your child the chance to learn to cook.</p>

<p><strong>4. Use family meals as a chance to talk</strong><br />
Family meals can be a great way to keep up with what everyone is doing. But sometimes children can find it hard to put their days into words. If this sounds like your child, it can help to ask your child questions that need more than a yes-or-no answer. For example, ‘Tell me one great thing that happened at school today’.</p>

<p>Another idea might be for everyone to take turns sharing something good and bad about their day. This way your child won’t feel like she’s being put on the spot.</p>

<p>But if your child really doesn’t want to talk, it’s best not to push too hard or bring up touchy subjects. It’s good for your child just to be with your family and listen to other people talking. The idea is to make mealtimes enjoyable and social.</p>

<p><strong>5. Reward good behaviour</strong><br />
When your younger children are eating nicely, using good manners and trying different foods, try to reward them with some descriptive praise. Tell them what they’re doing well. You might even want to use a reward chart to reward behaviour like trying every food on the plate or saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’.</p>

<p>Avoid using food as punishment or bribes. For example, it isn’t a good idea to say, ‘If you eat your broccoli, you can have some ice-cream for dessert’. This can make your child more interested in treats than healthy foods.</p>

<p><strong>6. Be creative with mealtimes</strong><br />
When you have the time and opportunity, having some fun with mealtimes can give the whole family something to look forward to. For example, on a weekend you might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>make pancakes for breakfast</li>
	<li>have a picnic at the park, in your backyard or on the lounge room floor</li>
	<li>invite a special guest over for dinner, like a friend, grandparent or neighbour. This can also be a great way of getting to know your older or teenage child’s friends</li>
	<li>create a meal with a theme – for example, food from a country with a language your child is learning at school.</li>
</ul>",12716,1,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3366, 3371, 3376, 3381, 3386, 3391, 3396",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/family-life/family-meals-cooking/family-meals-tips</p>,en,published

Your child can decide how much to eat – or whether to eat at all.If you’re concerned your child is overeating or undereating, a healthy eating routine can help.Be a good role model by eating healthy foods yourself and making sure you have plenty of healthy foods at home.","<h2>Healthy eating and your child’s appetite</h2>

<p>You might worry about whether your child is eating enough. Or you might be worried that your child is eating too much and above a healthy weight.</p>

<p>As a parent you give your child healthy food and opportunities to eat it. It’s up to your child to decide how much to eat – or whether to eat at all.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>normal for children’s appetites to change</strong> from day to day. Sometimes your child might want to eat a lot – just make sure that you fill him up with healthy food. Other times he might not want to eat. Try not to worry, because he’ll probably make up for it at the next meal or even the next day.</p>

<p>If your child doesn’t want to eat, try not to force her or offer food rewards. Forcing her to eat teaches her not to listen to her appetite.</p>

<p>If your child is growing and developing well, he’s probably getting enough to eat.</p>

<p>The most powerful way to send healthy food messages to your children is by letting them see you make healthy eating choices every day. Children will want to do what they see you doing.</p>

<h2>‘Tummy talk’ and healthy eating</h2>

<p>Understanding the way your child’s tummy ‘talks’ to her brain can help you deal with worries about your child undereating or overeating.</p>

<p>For example, your child’s brain realises his tummy is full only about 20 minutes after the food hits his tummy. Also, your child’s hunger is partly determined by how physically active he’s been and whether he needs to ‘catch up’ if he hasn’t eaten a lot over the last couple of days.</p>

<p>Offering meals and snacks at regular times encourages a better appetite at mealtimes. Regular meals and snacks can be part of a healthy eating routine.</p>

<h2>Overeating</h2>

<p>If you’re concerned that your child has a tendency to overeat, here are some things to try:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Offer a slightly smaller portion of food. If your child finishes it, you can offer a small second helping. This gives your child’s brain and tummy a chance to catch up.</li>
	<li>If your child doesn’t eat part of the meal – for example, the vegies – this is her choice. It isn’t a good idea to offer extra serves of other food – for example, meat – to make up for missing vegies.</li>
	<li>Serve your child’s food on a smaller plate. This way he gets the right-sized portion but still gets a ‘full plate’ of food.</li>
	<li>Avoid distractions like TV or toys during mealtimes. This will help your child focus on her appetite.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Undereating</h2>

<p>If you feel your child doesn’t eat enough at mealtimes or doesn’t have an appetite, you could try the following strategies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Offer food around the same times each day. If children eat at regular mealtimes, they’re more likely to be hungry at that time of day.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to eat more at mealtimes by making sure you serve small amounts at snack times. Your child needs small regular healthy snacks for energy top-ups, but if there are too many snacks or they’re too big, they can fill him up before a main meal.</li>
	<li>Avoid offering your child an alternative if she doesn’t eat a meal. Your child might just have a small appetite at the moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re worried about your child’s growth or eating habits, make an appointment to see a GP, paediatrician or dietitian.</p>

<h2>Healthy eating and food messages for your child</h2>

<p>Healthy eating habits start at home.</p>

<p>Giving your child healthy nutritious foods is important. It also helps to surround your child with <strong>messages about healthy eating habits</strong> and food. This can help your child make healthy food choices.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try to have a bowl full of fresh fruit within easy view and reach on the kitchen table or bench. You can offer fruit as a snack or if your child is still hungry after meals.</li>
	<li>Stock your pantry and fridge with lots of healthy, nutritious options, and leave the sometimes food on the supermarket shelves.</li>
	<li>Try to choose fruit and vegies of different colours, textures and tastes – the more variety there is, the more likely it is your child will find something that he’s interested in eating.</li>
	<li>Get your child involved in planning and preparing meals. If your child has helped to make the meal, she’s more likely to eat it.</li>
	<li>Enjoy healthy meals together as a family as often as possible. Also look for opportunities to eat together at breakfast and on weekends.</li>
	<li>Turn the TV off while eating. This way your child is paying attention to eating and the fresh healthy food choices you offer.</li>
	<li>Read books that have healthy food messages for your child – for example, books with pictures of fruits and vegetables. Get your child to point out different types, colours, shapes and so on.</li>
</ul>

1611,Eating away from home: children,Healthy eating habits at home help your child make healthy food choices away from home.Aim for a balanced approach to ‘sometimes’ foods when eating away from home.Pack healthy snacks and water for when you’re out and about.Look for healthy food outlets and healthy options on restaurant menus.,"<h2>Encouraging healthy food choices early</h2>

<p>If you give children healthy food and <strong>encourage healthy eating habits at home from early in life</strong>, it helps children learn about healthy food choices. This is a great foundation for children as they get older and are making independent food choices and eating away from home more often.</p>

<p>You have a big role to play in providing healthy food for your children and modelling healthy eating choices. Read more about healthy eating habits for kids and healthy eating habits for teenagers.</p>

<h2>Making healthy choices when eating away from home</h2>

<p>Your child or family might have an active social life, with lots of eating away from home.</p>

<p>Your child might also want to buy snacks and lunches from the school canteen or when she’s out and about with the family. Older children often like to stop off for a snack or drink on their way home from school too.</p>

<p>These are all great opportunities for your child to practise choosing good food, but they’re also times when your child might be tempted by any ‘sometimes’ foods on offer. There are a few things you can do to help your child make healthy food choices in these situations.</p>

<p><strong>Strike a balance</strong><br />
Sometimes foods include chips, chocolates, lollies, cakes, pastries, muesli bars, soft drinks, juices and takeaway foods – anything that’s high in sugar, salt and/or fat, and low in nutrition.</p>

<p>You can help your child take a balanced approach to sometimes foods by:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>saving sometimes foods for special occasions</li>
	<li>teaching your child to stop eating when he’s feeling full</li>
	<li>trying not to label foods as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, but focusing instead on all the good things about healthy eating</li>
	<li>not making a big deal about how tasty sometimes foods are</li>
	<li>trying not to use sometimes foods as a bribe or reward for good behaviour</li>
	<li>trying not to limit sometimes foods so much that they’re extra exciting – and a bit naughty – in your child’s eyes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Be prepared</strong><br />
If you know you’re going to be out at a time when your child is likely to be hungry – for example, after school or sport – try to <strong>take options for quick healthy snacks</strong>. For example, fruit, cheese or vegetable sticks are quick and easy, and a water bottle from home is cheaper and better than soft drink, sports drink or juice.</p>

<p>And if your child is going to be out without you at a time she often gets hungry, why not suggest she packs an extra piece of fruit or some yoghurt instead?</p>

<p>This way neither you nor your child will have to raid the vending machine, snack bar or fast food shop for unhealthy options – and you’ll both save money too!</p>

<p>Child care gives children a chance to eat with others and try new foods and tastes. If your child isn’t keen on the food at his child care setting, talk with his carers. By working together with child care staff, you can reinforce healthy food messages and eating for your child.</p>

<h2>Making healthy choices when eating out at restaurants</h2>

<p>Eating out in restaurants and takeaway outlets often means eating foods that are higher in fat and sugar than you’d have at home. Here are some tips to help you guide your child towards healthy choices when you’re eating out:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Talk with your child about the different menu options and encourage balance. For example, if your child orders a burger, she could ask for a side salad instead of chips.</li>
	<li>Share meals from the adult menu if the children’s meals are fried and have no salad or vegetables. You could also see whether you can get a half-portion of an adult meal for your child.</li>
	<li>Let your child know that he doesn’t need to finish everything on his plate – food portions at restaurants are usually larger than your child would eat at home.</li>
	<li>If your child wants dessert, encourage her to share a dessert.</li>
	<li>If ordering takeaway, encourage your child to skip soft drinks and avoid upsizing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Restaurants sometimes have nutrition labelling on their menus. For example, it might show how many kilojoules or calories are in a dish. This can help you and your child decide which dish is the healthiest option.</p>

<h2>Eating in: takeaway or homemade meals?</h2>

<p>Everyone enjoys a meal out and a night off from cooking. But you might find yourself choosing takeaway because you feel like you don’t have enough time or energy to cook.</p>

<p>If this sounds like your situation, you do have other options. As long as you’ve got healthy ingredients in your fridge and pantry, you can make quick, healthy meals at home in the time it takes to order and collect a takeaway.</p>

<p>For example, you and your child could make a pizza together, using pita bread topped with tomato, vegetables and low-fat cheese. A quick tuna and vegetable pasta is another idea. That way you can <strong>save sometimes foods for special occasions</strong>.</p>

<p>If you do choose to have takeaway, go for a healthier option – for example, a low-fat salad roll instead of hot chips and a burger.</p>",12716,1,"51,52,57,58",59,60,3411,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/teens/healthy-lifestyle/healthy-eating-habits/eating-away-from-home</p>,en,published
1621,Getting your child to eat breakfast,"Breakfast gives your child energy for play, learning, remembering and solving problems.A healthy breakfast has a balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat.Healthy breakfast options include porridge, oats, muesli, low-sugar wholegrain cereal, boiled eggs, omelettes, wholegrain toast, fruit and yoghurt.","<h2>Why a healthy breakfast is important</h2>

<p>Breakfast <strong>gives children the energy they need to handle their busy days</strong>. Children who eat a healthy breakfast go longer without feeling hungry. This means they can concentrate on playing, learning, remembering and solving problems.</p>

<p>A <strong>healthy breakfast can help children perform better at school</strong>.</p>

<p>Children who eat breakfast also tend to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>have better school attendance than those who regularly skip breakfast</li>
	<li>be more emotionally healthy than non-breakfast eaters</li>
	<li>stay at a healthy weight, because they’re less likely to snack on sugary or fatty foods.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What a healthy breakfast looks like</h2>

<p>A healthy breakfast needs to have a balance of carbohydrates, protein and fat to keep energy levels steady all morning.</p>

<p>Your child might like to choose from options like porridge, oats, muesli, low-sugar wholegrain cereal, boiled eggs, omelettes, wholegrain toast, fruit and yoghurt.</p>

<p>Wholegrains like multigrain bread, oats and porridge are good choices for breakfast. Your child’s body digests and absorbs them more slowly than processed, sugary cereals. They give your child longer-lasting energy and fullness throughout the day.</p>

<h2>Healthy breakfast ideas to encourage reluctant breakfast eaters</h2>

<p><strong>You’re an important role model</strong> when it comes to eating. Showing your children that breakfast is yummy and an important part of your day is a good way to encourage them to eat it. You can talk about the benefits of breakfast with them too.</p>

<p>Here are more breakfast ideas to encourage healthy eating habits in the morning:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make breakfast a time to sit and eat with your children. Being a good example is a powerful way to influence your children’s habits.</li>
	<li>If your child says he’s not hungry in the morning, try making a healthy smoothie, with milk, yoghurt and a piece of fruit like a banana, instead of a more traditional breakfast ‘meal’.</li>
	<li>Another option is for your child to eat a small meal at home, like a small bowl of oats or a piece of fruit. Then give your child a healthy snack to eat before school starts – for example, a sandwich or some yoghurt with fruit.</li>
	<li>If a busy morning schedule gets in the way of breakfast, try setting your child’s alarm 10 minutes earlier, or even getting breakfast ready the night before. For example, put cereal in the bowl overnight and leave it on the bench or table, so your child just has to add milk in the morning.</li>
	<li>If your child is a fussy eater at breakfast, think about ways to make breakfast more interesting. For example, you could try something like low-fat ricotta on wholemeal toast with sliced banana and honey drizzled on top.</li>
	<li>If your older child refuses to eat breakfast, try not to make a big deal about this. Your child might be doing this as a way of showing independence. You could suggest your child takes a piece of fruit or a healthy smoothie made with milk, yoghurt and fruit to have on the trip to school instead. Or encourage your child to choose his own healthy breakfast options when you’re out shopping.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nutritional benefits of breakfast</h2>

<p>Human bodies make energy from carbohydrates, breaking them down into a sugar called glucose. After a night without food, your body has used up its glucose. It starts to use stores of energy from your muscles instead, like glycogen and fatty acids. This is why we need a fuel top-up before we tackle the day.</p>

<p>Eating breakfast will give your child energy and get her metabolism started. It will help her body use the food she eats more efficiently throughout the day. Also, <strong>children who miss breakfast don’t ‘catch up’ on those missed nutrients</strong> during the rest of the day.</p>

1676,Fussy eating,"It’s normal for children to be fussy eaters. But they’ll probably be less fussy as they get older.Offer fussy eaters a few healthy options and let them choose what to eat.Pleasant, low-stress and regular mealtimes can help with fussy eating.","<h2>About fussy eating and fussy eaters</h2>

<p>It’s <strong>normal for children to be fussy eaters</strong> – that is, to not like the taste, shape, colour or texture of particular foods.</p>

<p>It’s also normal for children to like something one day but dislike it the next, to refuse new foods, and to eat more or less from day to day.</p>

<p>This all happens because <strong>fussy eating is part of children’s development</strong>. It’s a way of exploring their environment and asserting their independence. And it’s also because children’s appetites go up and down depending on how much they’re growing and how active they are.</p>

<p>The good news is that children are likely to get less fussy as they get older. One day your child will probably eat and enjoy a whole range of different foods.</p>

<h2>Handling fussy eaters: making mealtimes pleasant</h2>

<p>Your child’s willingness to try food will depend partly on the eating environment. Pleasant, low-stress mealtimes can help.</p>

<p>Here are some tips:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Make mealtimes happy, regular and social occasions.</strong> Try not to worry about spilled drinks or food on the floor.</li>
	<li>Start small. For example, start by asking your child to lick a piece of food, and work up to trying a mouthful. And praise your child for these small attempts.</li>
	<li>Never force your child to try a food. He’ll have lots of other opportunities to try new foods.</li>
	<li>If your child is fussing about food, ignore it as much as you can. Giving fussy eating lots of attention can sometimes encourage children to keep behaving this way.</li>
	<li>Make healthy foods fun – for example, cut sandwiches into interesting shapes, or let your child help prepare a salad or whisk eggs for an omelette.</li>
	<li>Turn the TV off so your family members can talk to each other instead.</li>
	<li>Set a time limit of about 20 minutes for meals. Anything that goes on too long isn’t fun. If your child hasn’t eaten the food in this time, take it away and don’t offer your child more food until the next planned meal or snack time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes toddlers are too distracted to sit at the family table for a meal. If this sounds like your child, <strong>try having quiet time before meals</strong> so she can calm down before eating. Even the ritual of hand-washing can help.</p>

<p>Offer a variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups at each family meal. Go for variety yourself – show your child that you’re willing to try new foods and that you enjoy them too. Healthy family food and an eating environment that encourages a positive attitude to healthy food make a great start for your child.</p>

<h2>Giving fussy eaters independence with food</h2>

<p>It can be a good idea to <strong>support your child’s need for independence</strong> when it comes to food. You provide healthy food options for your child. But let your child decide how much he’ll eat.</p>

<p>You could also <strong>try letting your child make choices within a range of healthy foods</strong>. Just limit the options to 2-3 things, so your child doesn’t get too confused or overwhelmed to eat. For example, instead of asking your child to pick what she wants from the fridge, you could ask, ‘Would you like grapes or carrot sticks?’</p>

<p>Another top tip is <strong>getting your child involved in preparing family meals</strong>. For example, your child could help out with:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>picking a recipe</li>
	<li>getting food out of the fridge</li>
	<li>washing fruit and vegies</li>
	<li>tossing a salad</li>
	<li>planting and picking herbs at home.</li>
</ul>

<p>He’ll feel proud of helping and be more likely to eat something he has helped to make.</p>

<p>Sometimes your child will refuse food just because it gets an interesting reaction from you! If children refuse to eat a food, it doesn’t necessarily mean they dislike it – after all, they might not have even tasted it yet. They might just be putting on a show of independence to see what you’ll do. Try to stay calm when this happens.</p>

<h2>Introducing new foods to fussy eaters</h2>

<p>If you have a fussy eater who doesn’t like trying new food, here are some tips that might help:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Keep offering new foods at different times. Your child will probably try them and eventually like them – but she might have to <strong>see a food on the plate 10-15 times </strong>before she even tries a taste.</li>
	<li>Put a small amount of new food on the plate with familiar food your child already likes – for example, a piece of broccoli alongside some mashed potato. Encourage your child to touch, smell or lick the new food.</li>
	<li>Make food attractive. Offer your child a variety of different colours, shapes and sizes and let your child choose what he eats from the plate.</li>
	<li>Serve your child the same meal the family is eating but in a portion size your child will eat. If your child doesn’t eat it, say something like, ‘Try it, it’s yummy’. If she still doesn’t want it, calmly say, ‘OK, we’ll try it another time when you’re hungry’.</li>
	<li>Offer different foods from each of the five healthy food groups. For example, if your child doesn’t like cheese, he might enjoy yoghurt instead.</li>
	<li>Try not to let your child fill up on drinks or ‘sometimes’ foods before introducing new foods. She’s more likely to try food if she’s hungry and doesn’t have the option of something else to eat.</li>
	<li>When possible, look for opportunities for your child to share meals and snacks with other children – he might be more willing to try a food if other children are tucking in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Punishments and bribes for fussy eaters</h2>

<p>Punishing your child for refusing to try new foods can turn new foods into a negative thing. If your child refuses to eat it, calmly take it away and offer it to her again another time.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to offer your child food treats just so he eats something – for example, ‘If you have a carrot, you can have some chocolate’. But this can make your child more interested in treats than healthy food. It also sends the message that eating healthy food is a chore.</p>

<h2>Fussy eating facts</h2>

<p>These facts can help you understand why children sometimes fuss about their food:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Children’s appetites are affected by their growth cycles. Even babies have changing appetites. At 1-6 years, it’s common for children to be really hungry one day and picky the next.</li>
	<li>Children have different taste preferences from grown-ups.</li>
	<li>Life is too exciting for children sometimes, and they’re too busy exploring the world around them to spend time eating.</li>
	<li>Children learn by testing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour. They can be very strong willed when it comes to making decisions about food (to eat or not to eat, and what to eat). It’s all part of their social, intellectual and emotional development.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child is healthy and has enough energy to play, learn and explore, she’s probably eating enough. But if your child eats only a very small range of foods or won’t eat entire food groups for a long time, see your GP, your child and family health nurse or a dietitian.</p>",11666,1,"50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3486, 3491",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/nutrition-fitness/common-concerns/fussy-eating</p>,en,published
1681,Messy eating,"Messy eating is a normal part of children’s development.Messy eating develops fine motor skills and helps children learn about food and their world.Be patient, praise tidy eating, and use plastic or newspaper under your child’s highchair.","<h2>Why children are messy eaters</h2>

<p>Children go through developmental stages as they learn to feed themselves. First they learn to eat solids by taking food from a spoon or picking up food with their hands. Then they move on to feeding themselves with spoons, forks and cups.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of time, practice and muscle coordination for children to learn to get food into their mouths without making a mess, so you can expect a few spills along the way!</p>

<h2>Messy eating and playing with food</h2>

<p>Young children love to experiment and play with their food, even after they’ve developed the motor skills they need to eat without mess.</p>

<p>In fact, playing with food is one of the ways children develop their fine motor skills. And playing with unfamiliar foods can help children become more open to tasting these new foods.</p>

<p>Exploring the shape, colour and texture of food also helps children learn about their world. For example, here are just some of the <strong>amazing things your child might learn </strong>by playing with food:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Dropping things makes them fall down.</li>
	<li>Throwing things makes them fly through the air.</li>
	<li>Squishing peas changes the way they look and feel.</li>
	<li>Sticking a sandwich in a drink makes Mum upset!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can understand why your child is playing with food and have a laugh about it, it might make accidents and mess easier to put up with.</p>

<h2>What you can do about messy eating</h2>

<p>Most young children squish food in their hands, throw food and bowls onto the floor, deliberately dribble with their mouths full, or refuse to eat.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to help you cut down on mealtime mess – and make it less stressful:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cut food into strips or fingers</strong>, and let your child use his hands rather than a spoon or fork. In the early days of learning to eat, your child will find this way of eating easier to manage.</li>
	<li>Praise your child’s efforts when she eats something without making a big mess. It’s best to tell your child exactly what she did well – for example, ‘Emily, I love the way you put that banana straight into your mouth’.</li>
	<li><strong>Involve your child in</strong> <strong>setting the table</strong>, if he’s old enough. If your child has helped to set up the meal, he might be less inclined to mess it up.</li>
	<li><strong>Sit together and share mealtimes as a family.</strong> This lets you lead by example and show your child how to eat and behave at the table. But remember that it can take time for your child to learn these skills.</li>
	<li><strong>Stay calm and patient with your child’s mess.</strong> This will help you and your child to enjoy mealtimes more.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll find messes easier to clean up if you put some plastic or newspaper around your child as she eats. You can also try using a feeding smock or bib to keep clothes clean, and leaving bath time or a change of clothes until after meals.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If your child’s messy eating continues into the preschool years, it’s a good idea to talk to your GP, child and family health nurse or dietitian about your child’s development.</p>",12716,1,"47,48,49,50",59,60,"3501, 3506",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/nutrition-fitness/common-concerns/messy-eating</p>,en,published
1686,Weaning off breastfeeding: older children,"Weaning can be stressful for a toddler or preschooler so take it slowly. Give your child comfort and cuddles to make the change easier.Our top tip for weaning older children? Never offer a breastfeed, but never refuse.","<h2>About weaning off breastfeeding</h2>

<p>Weaning is when you stop breastfeeding your child.</p>

<p>Some children are more attached to breastfeeding than other children are. They’ll all wean in their own time. But if you don’t want to wait for your child to wean herself, weaning can happen when you’re ready. You might need to wean, for example, because you’re going back to or starting work.</p>

<h2>Weaning: planning ahead</h2>

<p>Weaning is likely to be <strong>a big change for your child</strong>. For many older children, breastfeeding is more about security and comfort than about food, so weaning can be quite stressful.</p>

<p>This means it’s probably best to avoid weaning when there are other major changes in your child’s life – for example, toilet training, starting child care or moving house.</p>

<p>A few weeks or months before you start weaning, it’s a good idea to <strong>start talking with your child about what will happen</strong>. This will give your child time to get used to the idea and can help to make the change easier.</p>

<h2>Weaning tips</h2>

<p>When you’re weaning older children off breastfeeding, a good way to start is to <strong>never offer a breastfeed, but never refuse</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are more tips that can help. You can start with the tip you think will suit your child best, or use a few if that suits you both:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drop one breastfeed at a time, and wait a few days before you drop the next one. This will also be easier on your breasts, which might get engorged if you stop too suddenly.</li>
	<li>Consider <strong>dropping daytime breastfeeds first</strong>, then gradually drop any bedtime or night-time feeds – these are the ones your child probably feels most needy about.</li>
	<li><strong>Introduce a few limits</strong>, like not breastfeeding when you’re out, or feeding only after lunch during the day.</li>
	<li>Introduce lots of activities and outings into your daily routine so your child is too busy and distracted to think about breastfeeding.</li>
	<li>Occasionally replace a breastfeed with a ‘grown-up’ alternative. Your child might be excited about having a special but healthy drink like a babyccino at a café when he’d normally be at home having a breastfeed.</li>
	<li>Try the <strong>‘out of sight, out of mind’</strong> principle. This involves leaving your child with someone she’s comfortable with at times when she’d normally have a breastfeed, because she’ll be less likely to miss it if you’re not around.</li>
	<li>Avoid dressing and undressing while your child is around, and wear clothes that make it hard for your child to get to your breasts – for example, dresses rather than separates.</li>
	<li>If your child wakes in the night for a breastfeed, try to let your partner or someone else settle him with a cup of milk or water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that children over 12 months of age can be weaned to cow’s milk from a cup. You don’t need to wean an older child onto formula.</p>

<h2>Weaning off morning and night feeds</h2>

<p>Your child’s last remaining breastfeeds might be at bedtime and when she wakes in the morning.</p>

<p>To <strong>drop the morning feed</strong>, try to be up and dressed before your child wakes, then offer him a cup of milk and breakfast.</p>

<p>To <strong>drop the bedtime feed</strong>, a change of routine can help break the old routine. You could try a sleepover with grandparents, or your partner could read stories to your child instead of a breastfeed.</p>

<p>If your child is used to being fed to sleep, change the routine by offering a story after the feed, as an incentive to stay awake.</p>

<p>Feeding in another room, and not just before bed, can also help break the association between feeding and sleeping. Once you’ve broken the association, over time you can drop the feed.</p>

<p>When weaning your child off night feeds, make sure her bedtime still involves a relaxed, warm routine with lots of cuddles.</p>

<p>If you’re feeling a bit sad about the last breastfeed, that’s pretty normal. It might help to remind yourself that you’ve done a great job giving your child a healthy start to life.</p>",12716,1,"49,50",59,60,"2761, 2766, 2771",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/nutrition-fitness/common-concerns/weaning-older-children</p>,en,published
1691,Toddler not eating? Ideas and tips,"It’s common for toddlers to eat very small amounts, be fussy or not eat at all.Give toddlers healthy food, and let them decide how much food to eat.Try to judge toddler appetite over a week, rather than over a single day.Try to create a positive eating environment, persist with new foods and follow your toddler’s lead.","<h2>Toddler not eating – or not eating enough?</h2>

<p>Many parents worry about whether their toddlers are eating enough healthy food. It’s common for toddlers to eat only very small amounts, to be fussy about what they eat, and to refuse to eat at all.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Toddler appetites vary constantly because of growth spurts and variations in activity.</li>
	<li>Toddlers aren’t growing as fast as babies, so they need less food.</li>
	<li>Toddlers have small stomachs.</li>
	<li>Toddlers are very interested in the world around them, so they have short attention spans for food.</li>
	<li>Toddlers want to push boundaries and show how independent they can be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Liking a food one day and refusing it the next is common toddler behaviour. It’s one of the ways that toddlers show how independent they are. It can help to think of it this way: you provide healthy food options for your child, and your child decides how much food to eat – or not eat.</p>

<h2>Appetite ups and downs: how to handle them</h2>

<p>If your child won’t eat or won’t eat whole meals, you could try reducing the amount you’re offering. It’s normal for toddlers to <strong>need only small servings at mealtimes</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, avoid trying to force your child to finish everything on the plate, because this can make mealtimes stressful. Instead, <strong>praise your child for trying a spoonful</strong> or having a sip of water, if that’s all they want.</p>

<p>At regular times between meals, you can offer your child healthy snacks like fruit or vegetable sticks. This should keep your child going if they’re eating only small amounts at main meals.</p>

<p>As long as you offer healthy food, try not to worry if your child doesn’t eat very much sometimes. <strong>Your child won’t starve.</strong> Children are actually very good at judging how much food they need.</p>

<p>It can help to <strong>judge your child’s appetite over a week, rather than over a single day</strong>. It’s OK if your child eats less today – they might be hungrier tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Trying new foods: tips</h2>

<p>You might think your child is fussy and will eat only one or two particular foods.</p>

<p>But sometimes toddlers will try new foods if you just keep trying. Here are some ideas that might help.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a positive eating environment</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Make mealtimes a happy, regular and social family occasion. Sit together to eat with your child whenever you can.</li>
	<li>Show your child how much you enjoy eating the food you’ve prepared.</li>
	<li>Get your child involved in helping to prepare and cook family meals.</li>
	<li>Offer new foods when you and your child are relaxed, and your child isn’t too tired or distracted by other things.</li>
	<li>Set a time limit of about 20 minutes for a meal. If your child hasn’t eaten the food, take it away and don’t offer an alternative snack or meal.</li>
	<li>Avoid punishing your child for refusing to try new foods. This can turn tasting new foods into a negative thing.</li>
	<li>Avoid bribing your child with treats just so they’ll eat some healthy food. This can make your child more interested in treats than healthy food and sends the message that eating healthy food is a chore.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Serving new foods</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Keep offering new foods. <strong>It can take 10-15 tries for children to accept and enjoy new foods.</strong></li>
	<li>Serve your child the same foods as the rest of the family. Your child will get the nutritional benefits of a wide range of foods, and accept new tastes and textures as ‘normal’.</li>
	<li>Offer new foods with foods that your child already knows and likes.</li>
	<li>If your child refuses something, offer it again in a week or so. Your child might gobble it up and even ask for more – toddler interest in food can fluctuate wildly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Following your child’s lead</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Let your child touch, lick and play with food, and expect some mess as they learn to eat.</li>
	<li>Let your child feed themselves, and give your child some help if needed.</li>
	<li>If your child loses interest, or seems tired, cranky or unwell, take the food away.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve found something your child eats and enjoys, it can be tempting to keep serving it up. But your child needs to eat a wide variety of foods to get all the nutrients they need for growth and development. So it’s important to keep offering your child lots of different foods.</p>

<p>Offer a variety of nutritious foods from the five food groups at each family meal. Go for variety yourself – show your child that you’re willing to try new foods and that you enjoy them too. Healthy family food and an eating environment that encourages a positive attitude to healthy food make a great start for your child.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Signs toddlers might need help with food and eating</h2>

<p>If your child is generally healthy and growing well, and has enough energy to play, learn and explore, your child is probably eating enough.</p>

<p>But check with your GP, child and family health nurse or a dietitian if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child only eats a very small range of foods</li>
	<li>your child won’t eat entire food groups for a time</li>
	<li>your child consistently refuses food</li>
	<li>you’re concerned about your child’s growth or overall nutrition.</li>

1696,Physical activity for babies and children: why and how much,Physical activity is vital for young children’s health and development.Physical activity is any activity that involves moving your body.Children need different amounts of physical activity at different ages.It’s good for children to spend more time being active and less time sitting still.,"<h2>Physical activity: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Physical activity is vital for children’s health, wellbeing and development, now and in the future.</p>

<p>Physical activity has lots of <strong>health benefits for children</strong>. It:</p>

<ul>
	<li>strengthens children’s bones, muscles, hearts and lungs</li>
	<li>improves children’s coordination, balance, posture and flexibility</li>
	<li>helps children stay at a healthy weight</li>
	<li>reduces children’s risk of getting heart disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes later in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical activity also boosts <strong>children’s wellbeing</strong>. For example, active children are more likely to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>be confident and feel like they belong</li>
	<li>be relaxed and sleep well</li>
	<li>concentrate better at school</li>
	<li>get along with others and make friends easily</li>
	<li>share, take turns and cooperate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical activity is an <strong>important part of play and learning</strong>. And when children do physical activity with you or other people, it can be a great way for them to build relationships in your family and community.</p>

<p>Physical activity is also just <strong>good fun</strong> for children.</p>

<h2>What is physical activity?</h2>

<p>Physical activity is <strong>any activity that involves moving your body</strong>. It includes everyday activities, physically active play, and organised sports and exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Light physical activity</strong> could be going for a stroll, playing a musical instrument or standing up to paint at an easel.</p>

<p><strong>Moderate physical activity</strong> gets children gently huffing and puffing. It could be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>walking quickly</li>
	<li>riding to child care, school or a friend’s house</li>
	<li>dancing, skipping, jumping in puddles or flying kites</li>
	<li>swimming.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vigorous physical activity</strong> gets children huffing and puffing a lot, as well as sweating. It could be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>playing running games like ‘keepings off’ or ‘chasey’</li>
	<li>riding a bike fast</li>
	<li>playing organised sports like soccer, basketball, touch football or netball.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Activities that strengthen muscles and bones </strong>make muscles work more than normal and put extra force on bones – for example, jumping, running, climbing and lifting. Moderate and vigorous physical activities often help to build muscles and bones.</p>

<p><strong>Energetic play</strong> is a natural way for children to move and be active. For example, babies rock and kick their feet. Older children run, jump, twirl, kick, throw, dance to music, play on playground equipment, enjoy rough-and-tumble play, and much more.</p>

<h2>How much physical activity do children need each day?</h2>

<p>Australian guidelines say that <strong>children aged under 1 year</strong> should have lots of floor play. For babies who aren’t up and about, 30 minutes of tummy time each day is good.</p>

<p>Children aged <strong>1 year up to 3 years </strong>should be physically active for at least three hours each day. This includes energetic play.</p>

<p>Children aged <strong>3 years up to 5 years</strong> should be physically active for at least three hours each day. This includes one hour of energetic play.</p>

<p>Children aged <strong>5</strong> <strong>years up to 18 years</strong> should do at least one hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity plus several hours of light physical activity each day. And at least three days a week, this should include activities that strengthen muscles and bones.</p>

<p>Young people aged <strong>over 18 years </strong>should do 2½-5 hours of moderate physical activity or 1¼-2½ hours of vigorous physical activity per week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous physical activity that adds up to enough activity overall. And at least two days a week, they should do activities that strengthen muscles.</p>

<p>Your child can do physical activity in small blocks of time throughout the day. The key thing is that your child does enough physical activity overall. And the more physical activity your child does and the less time your child spends sitting, the better it is for your child.</p>

<h2>Physical activity and children with additional needs</h2>

<p>Physical activity is important for all children.</p>

<p>If your child has additional needs, like a disability or medical condition, or you have any concerns about the amount and type of physical activity your child gets, it’s a good idea to talk to your GP or another health professional.</p>",12671,1,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3516, 186, 3521",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/play/physical-activity-how-much</p>,en,published

1711,Preparing and sharing food: activity for children 3-6 years,"Learning to share is an important play and friendship skill.Preparing and sharing food is a fun way for your child to learn to share.Good dishes to prepare and share include fruit salad, easy pizza, muffins and ice blocks.","<h2>Preparing and sharing food: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Preparing a meal, snack or drinks for family or friends is a fun way for your child to learn to share.</p>

<p>Sharing food <strong>helps your child learn about compromising, taking turns and negotiating</strong>. For example, through sharing food, your child learns that if he gives a little to others, he can get some of what he wants as well.</p>

<p>Learning to share is important for making and keeping friends and playing well with other children. But <strong>sharing can be a challenge</strong>, especially at first. Your child will need lots of practice and encouragement.</p>

<h2>What you need for preparing and sharing food with children</h2>

<p>Choose a simple meal or snack to make with your child. Your child could also prepare a jug of water or juice and some cups for extra sharing practice.</p>

<p>Here are some good dishes to prepare and share:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fruit salad: choose soft fruits like bananas, strawberries and watermelon. These are easy for your child to cut with a safe knife. Help your child by peeling the fruit first.</li>
	<li>Strawberry ice blocks: this recipe is great for hot weather. And you can vary it by using your child’s favourite fruits.</li>
	<li>Carrot and oat mini muffins: this is a good choice for lunch boxes and snacks. Mixing and measuring the ingredients is fun and helps your child’s numeracy skills.</li>
	<li>Easy pizza: your child might enjoy helping you put toppings on the pizza and serving it up for lunch or dinner. You can talk about who needs bigger or smaller serves.</li>
	<li>Finger foods: your child can help you spread toppings on toast soldiers or arrange fresh or cooked vegies on a plate for sharing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kitchens can be dangerous places for children. Always supervise your child around hot surfaces and liquids, electrical appliances and sharp objects.</p>

<h2>How to prepare and share food with children</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Involve your child in choosing food to prepare for friends or family. When you’re choosing, think about your child’s abilities, as well as how much time you have to prepare the food.</li>
	<li>Prepare the meal or snack with your child. Remind your child that you’re making the food to share. For example, ‘There are five of us. Do you think that’s enough strawberries for everyone?’</li>
	<li>Ask your child to count the number of people, and help her to divide food among plates or bowls. If you’re serving at the table, remind your child of your family rules – for example, serve the oldest person or the birthday person first, and serve yourself last.</li>
	<li>For finger food or plates of food like cookies, encourage your child to walk around and offer the food to people.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to think about fairness. For example, ‘Jun Jie, there’s only one piece of cake left, but Kimberly and Kumar both want it. What should we do?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting a food sharing activity for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Keep dishes very simple for <strong>your younger child</strong>, so that he can be involved in preparing and sharing food. If your child is still learning to share, he might think the food is ‘his’ because he made it. You can gently remind him that he made it to share.</p>

<p><strong>Your older child</strong> can concentrate for longer and has better hand-eye coordination, so she can probably manage more complicated recipes. She might even help you prepare an evening meal sometimes.</p>",12716,1,"51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/preparing-and-sharing-food-activity</p>,en,published

<p>Washing fruit and vegetables can be a fun way to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>introduce your child to new words like ‘capsicum’, ‘zucchini’ and ‘plum’</li>
	<li>introduce your child to numeracy concepts like shape, size and weight</li>
	<li>develop thinking skills</li>
	<li>encourage your child to explore his everyday environment</li>
	<li>help your child learn about daily hygiene and healthy food.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you need for washing fruit and vegetables</h2>

<p>For this activity, you involve your child in washing the fruits and vegetables after you bring them home from the market or supermarket.</p>

<p>The <strong>more fruits and vegetables</strong> you have, the better.</p>

<p>You’ll need a sink and a tap, and a bit of <strong>extra time</strong> so your child can help you with washing.</p>

<h2>How to make washing fruit and vegetables a learning activity</h2>

<p>Here’s <strong>how to get started</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fill the sink or a tub with clean, cool water for washing your fruits and vegetables.</li>
	<li>Make sure your child can see and reach. Find her a safe stool or stepladder to stand on if you need to.</li>
	<li>Show your child how to wash a fruit or vegetable by tipping it into the water and gently rubbing the skin with your hands.</li>
	<li>Take the fruit or vegetable out of the water and dry it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once your child understands what he’s doing, you can let him explore. Watch what your child does and <strong>introduce words and concepts </strong>by talking and asking questions. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Talk about colours. Ask your child to name the colours of the fruits and vegetables.</li>
	<li>Talk about shape, size and texture. You can compare things – for example, ‘Which tomato is bigger?’ and ‘This carrot is longer than this cucumber’.</li>
	<li>Explore floating and sinking. Ask your child to guess whether something will float or sink before she puts it in the water.</li>
	<li>Talk about which parts of the plant the produce comes from. Spinach is a leaf vegetable, radishes and carrots are roots, and tomatoes are fruits (even if they don’t taste sweet!).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting for this learning activity for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Be aware of the interests and attention span of <strong>your young child</strong>. If your child just enjoys splashing in the sink, give him a few firm pieces of produce (like carrots or apples) to wash and handle, and then take over when he’s had enough.</p>

<p>You can challenge <strong>your older child</strong> with more complex questions while she washes fruit and vegetables – for example, ‘Why do you think plants need leaves?’ You can also just use the time to chat about your favourite fruits and vegetables, or the meals you’re planning to make with the produce.</p>",11726,1,"51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/washing-fruit-and-vegetables-activity-for-children-3-6-years</p>,en,published
1721,Cooking activities for kids: 3-6 years,"Cooking helps kids learn skills. It’s also a great way to spend time with your child.For cooking with kids, you need simple recipes, ingredients and equipment – plus time!When you’re cooking with your child, let your child do as much as possible.","<h2>Cooking activities for kids: why they’re good</h2>

<p>Cooking with kids is about so much more than preparing food.</p>

<p>For example, cooking can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>help your child learn early numeracy skills through measuring or counting</li>
	<li>help your child develop literacy skills through reading recipes</li>
	<li>be special time with you, which is good for your relationship with your child</li>
	<li>be creative, hands-on, messy and fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>Sitting down with your family and sharing a meal that you’ve prepared together is also a great way for your child to develop social skills like sharing, talking and listening.</p>

<h2>What you need for cooking activities with kids</h2>

<p>It’s good to give your child a choice about what to cook, but it’s also important to <strong>make sure the recipe is simple enough</strong>, or you’ll end up doing it all yourself while she watches.</p>

<p>You might know a simple dish that you could make with your child. Perhaps it’s something he likes to eat, like a favourite meal or dessert. Otherwise, look online for child-friendly recipes, or at your library or bookshop for cookbooks for children.</p>

<p>Once you’ve decided what to cook, check that you have all the <strong>ingredients and equipment</strong> you need, plus a clear workspace.</p>

<p>You also need <strong>plenty of time</strong>. Your child is likely to mix and measure very slowly, and you might need to clear up spills as you go. Your child will probably want to taste all the ingredients too!</p>

<p>Kitchens can be dangerous places for children. Always supervise your child around hot surfaces, hot liquids, electrical appliances and sharp objects.</p>

<h2>How to cook with kids</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Talk about the dish before you start. Show your child the ingredients and the recipe, if you’re using one.</li>
	<li>Let your child do as much as possible. Your child could wash vegetables and fruit, pour and stir, and help with measuring and counting. Your child could even try some easy cutting under careful supervision – for example, cutting soft fruit with a butter knife. You might need to show your child what to do first, then let her try.</li>
	<li>Talk about what you’re doing, and introduce words like ‘grate’ and ‘mash’. You can also encourage your child to come up with words to describe flavours and textures, like ‘salty’, ‘crumbly’ or ‘crunchy’.</li>
	<li>Talk about which foods are healthy and why.</li>
	<li>Let your child share his dish with friends or family. Praise your child’s cooking and hard work!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting cooking activities for kids of different ages</h2>

<p>A simple green salad is a good first dish for <strong>your younger child</strong>. Help your child wash the leaves and herbs, then let her tear them up with her fingers. Help your child to measure and add the ingredients for the dressing, and give her a set of spoons to mix the salad in the bowl.</p>

<p>Written recipes are a good way for <strong>your older child</strong> to develop literacy and numeracy skills. Read the recipe with your child before you start. You can talk about concepts like fractions, weights and temperature.</p>

<p>Cooking can be a window to other countries and cultures. You can talk with your child about the countries that dishes come from and the people who live there.</p>",11721,1,"52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/cooking-activities-for-kids-3-6-years</p>,en,published

1746,Premature birth: mental and emotional preparation,"If you know you might have a premature birth, it’s normal for you and your partner to feel many positive and negative emotions.  Get information from nurses and doctors, and speak to other parents who have had a premature birth.  Relaxing exercises and positive thinking can help you feel ready for premature birth.  It is a good idea to get familiar with the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) before birth.","<h2>Getting mentally and emotionally ready for premature birth</h2>

<p>If you know you might have a premature birth and a baby who will need to stay in hospital, it’s normal for you and your partner to feel a range of emotions. For example, you might feel joy, love, helplessness, sadness, guilt, fear or worry.</p>

<p>It can help to read up on premature births and premature babies. It is also good to talk to your doctor or nurse and ask questions about premature labour and birth. Speaking to other parents who have had a premature baby will probably help too.</p>

<p>If possible try and participate in antenatal classes at your hospital. Antenatal classes are not just about birth – they also teach you about looking after your newborn.</p>

<h2>Staying calm before premature birth</h2>

<p>You might feel confused or overwhelmed in the lead-up to the birth. Here are some strategies that can help you stay calm:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do breathing exercises, muscle relaxation exercises or mindfulness exercises.</li>
	<li>Do activities and hobbies that relax you. For example, listen to relaxing music, go for a walk, paint, read or take a warm bath.</li>
	<li>Take everything one step at a time. For example, focus on what you need to do today, and try not to worry about what might happen tomorrow.</li>
	<li>Focus on positive thoughts – for example, try thinking about your baby in a calm, loving and positive way.</li>
	<li>Ask for help if you need it. You can talk to a family member or friend who you trust to listen to you. You can also talk to your doctor or nurse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting familiar with the NICU</h2>

<p>Your baby might be taken to the NICU after the birth. Babies in NICUs tend to have lots of machines and technology all around them, which can be overwhelming and even scary at first. Sometimes it is hard to imagine the NICU as a nursery.</p>

<p>If you visit the NICU before the birth, it will feel more familiar when you visit your baby there. Your doctor or midwife can arrange this for you.</p>

<h2>Preparing siblings for a premature birth and baby</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to speak with your older children before you go to hospital.</p>

<p>Talking to your children about what is happening can<strong> help them to feel less anxious and confused</strong> about the change in plans. They might worry that they caused the baby to come early, or that they’ll catch the baby’s illness. You can let them know that they didn’t do anything and they cannot catch the baby’s illness.</p>

<p>Give your children <strong>a rough idea of how long you and their new brother or sister will be in hospital</strong> – for example, how many days or weeks. You could make a calendar that your older children can draw on. It can show when they visited, and they can also use it to cross off the days until the new baby comes home.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to <strong>explain that you’ll be spending a lot of time visiting the hospital</strong>. It can help children if they know who will be looking after them while you are in hospital or visiting your baby in the NICU.</p>

<p>You could also talk to them about visiting the baby. If you <strong>show them pictures of premature babies</strong>, they’ll be better prepared for what the baby will look like when they visit. They could do a drawing to give to the baby, so they feel closer to their new sibling.</p>

<p>Preparing yourself mentally and emotionally for premature birth is important. There are also lots of practical things you can do before premature birth to make things easier for yourself and your family.</p>",1576,4,"43,44",59,60,"3551, 3556",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/premature-birth/premature-birth-emotional-prep"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/premature-birth/premature-birth-emotional-prep</a></p>",en,published
1751,Dads: premature birth and premature babies,"As a dad, it is important to think about your feelings and needs, and take time for yourself.  Daily care tasks and skin-to-skin contact can help you build a relationship with your premature baby.  You might have extra responsibilities after a premature birth. It is okay to ask for and accept help.","<h2>After a premature birth: dads’ feelings</h2>

<p>Straight after a premature birth, you might be the one who has to talk to doctors, learn about your premature baby’s condition and tell your partner, family and friends what is going on.</p>

<p>You might <strong>feel you have to be strong and supportive</strong> and hold yourself and everyone else together. You might be excited about becoming a father, but also torn between your concerns for your baby (or babies) and your partner’s health. You might feel like you have ‘lost control’, cannot protect your loved ones, or cannot cope. In some cultures, fathers can feel some stigma about a premature birth, or a sense of shame.</p>

<p>It is also normal and understandable to <strong>feel lost or stretched between responsibilities</strong> at home – including looking after other children – hospital and work.</p>

<p>You might want to start caring for your baby straight away, and feel frustrated because you cannot. For some dads, it takes longer to feel like a father.</p>

<p>With so much going on practically and emotionally, it is also normal to feel a lot of stress after a premature birth.</p>

<p>Whatever the situation and your feelings about it, <strong>your feelings and needs can get forgotten</strong>, with family and hospital staff focusing on your premature baby and your partner.</p>

<h2>Dads: coping with feelings after a premature birth</h2>

<p>Many dads push their feelings away, or go back to work straight away as a way to cope.</p>

<p>But acknowledging your emotions and needs is a healthy thing to do. It’s good to take time to think about your feelings and needs. Take time for yourself too – even if it is just a 30-minute nap or a hot shower.</p>

<p>It also helps to talk to someone you can trust about how you are feeling, like your partner, a friend or family member. You could also talk with the social worker or another health professional at the hospital. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone asked me how I was coping with having a premature baby in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). My eyes filled with tears, because no-one had asked me about my feelings before. The hospital staff tended to make eye contact with my wife when they talked to us. I had taken three months off work to be with my wife and baby, but I had started to feel superfluous and invisible.<br />
– Dad of a premature baby</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dads: bonding with your premature baby</h2>

<p>As a dad, you have a big impact on your child’s development from birth. Newborn babies are <strong>born ready to connect with both their parents</strong>.</p>

<p>The earlier you hold your premature baby and get involved in his care, the sooner you are likely to feel affection and love for your baby. And a close relationship between you and your baby can help you feel better about yourself and better able to cope.</p>

<p><strong>Skin-to-skin contact</strong>, also known as kangaroo care, between you and your baby is a great way to bond with your premature baby and start feeling connected. In fact, skin-to-skin contact can make you feel more like the baby belongs to you. You might also start feeling like you want to protect and care for your baby, if you have not felt this before. Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) staff can show you how to touch and hold your baby.</p>

<p>Even if you cannot hold your baby, you might still be able to touch her through the incubator. As your baby gets older, you might want to talk to your baby, read a book or sing to her. This can all help with bonding.</p>

<p>Keeping notes and taking photos or videos can help you feel more connected to your baby. You might think you’ll never forget this time in your life, but even the strongest memories fade over time.</p>

<h2>Getting involved while your premature baby is in hospital</h2>

<p>Sometimes dads think that there is no role for them with little babies. You might even feel like you are ‘the husband or partner’ but not ‘the father’.</p>

<p><strong>Being hands on with the</strong> <strong>daily care</strong> of your premature baby, where possible, is the best way to build your skills and confidence. For example, you might want to be involved in feeding, changing nappies or settling your baby. Or you could learn how to give your baby a bath.</p>

<p>These activities also create one-on-one time with your baby, which is the building block of a positive relationship.</p>

<p>Premature babies can get overstimulated and stressed easily. You can see signs of tiredness in their body language and in their vital signs, like heart rate and oxygen levels. It’s a good idea to check with your baby’s nurse about what you can do and how much your baby can handle – especially in the early days.</p>

<p>And if you ever feel left out of your baby’s care, just talk to the nurse or doctor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> </p>

<h2>Spending time in the NICU with your premature baby</h2>

<p>The more time you spend in the NICU, the better it is for your child’s development. That is because you are getting your relationship with your child off to a great start.</p>

<p>If you are in the NICU as much as possible, it can also help your partner feel more confident. Your support can boost her wellbeing and mental health, and support her relationship with the baby and with you.</p>

<p>If you have to go back to work, any amount of time you can spend in the NICU is still good for your baby, your partner and you.</p>

<h2>Your relationship with your partner when you have a premature baby</h2>

<p>Having a premature baby can put strain on your relationship with your partner.</p>

<p>But it can also bring you closer to your partner as you go through the experience together. Many dads find that their relationship plays a big part in helping them cope with the experience of having a premature baby.</p>

<p>If your partner cannot get to the NICU in the first few days, you might like to take a photo or video of your baby to give to your partner after the birth. Hearing and seeing your baby can help your partner feel a bit better and more connected.</p>

<p>You can also help prepare your partner for the first visit by letting her know what to expect in the NICU.</p>

<p>Dads can get postnatal depression too. Read more in our article on depression in men during pregnancy and after birth.</p>

<h2>Managing extra responsibilities when you have a premature baby in hospital</h2>

<p>When your baby is in the NICU, you might feel like you have more responsibility than you are ready for.</p>

<p>If you have other children, you will be juggling their needs and care, as well as bringing them to the hospital so they can see their mother and the new baby.</p>

<p>As well as making trips into the hospital, you’ll probably be doing the shopping, keeping the house clean, going to work, organising visitors, and dropping off and picking up your other children.</p>

<p>If your partner is sent home while your baby is still in hospital, your partner is likely to be busy expressing breastmilk for the baby or spending a lot of time at the hospital. This means you<strong> could be busy managing home and family</strong> for quite a while.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas to help you with managing all this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Talk openly and honestly with your partner about what is happening for both of you. Good communication will help things run smoothly.</li>
	<li>Agree with your partner on who does what – and what does not have to be done. For example, it might not matter if the house does not get cleaned as often.</li>
	<li>Ask family members and friends for help with looking after your older children.</li>
	<li>Look into ways to save time on household tasks. </li>
	<li>Look into whether your workplace has any leave arrangements that might let you take some extra time off.</li>
	<li><strong>Say ‘Yes, please!’</strong> if someone offers to cook you a meal, do your shopping, pick up your children and so on.</li>

You can cope with negative feelings by accepting and talking about your feelings. It is normal to have ups and downs, but try to focus on your baby’s successes and milestones. When you look after yourself physically and emotionally, you will be in better shape to care for your baby.","<h2>Your feelings after premature birth: what to expect</h2>

<p>A premature birth can shake your confidence in the world. <strong>It is normal to feel many mixed and sometimes conflicting emotions.</strong></p>

<p>There are <strong>positive emotions</strong>, of course, like joy and love for your newborn.</p>

<p>But it is common to wonder about what happened and what caused the early birth. You might feel <strong>helpless, sad, guilty, anxious or traumatised</strong> by the birth experience. There might also be concern, fear and confusion about seeing your baby in the NICU or special care nursery (SCN).</p>

<p>Some parents might feel <strong>angry</strong> at themselves or their doctors. Or they might feel angry at their baby for making them feel this bad, or for being born early. This might mean they feel reluctant to hold their baby or visit the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This is normal too.</p>

<p>Many people <strong>feel like things are not quite real</strong>. And it is easy to feel powerless or that you have no control over the future. Some parents find it hard to feel they really ‘own’ their baby while she’s in the NICU.</p>

<p>Many mothers find the day they leave hospital very difficult. The separation from the baby might feel worse on the day you go home.</p>

<p><strong>Over time, there are generally fewer challenges</strong>, and they get easier to cope with. And as your baby gets bigger and more medically stable, you’ll be able to hold and care for her more often. As you get to know the NICU, it will feel more comfortable too. The nursing staff and other members of your baby’s care team will help you as well as care for your baby.</p>

<p>All of this can help you to feel more confident, less anxious and better able to connect and bond with your baby.</p>

<h2>Tips for coping with your feelings about premature birth</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas that might help you cope with negative feelings and start to feel more positive.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with feelings</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Accept your feelings, whatever they are – do not push them away. Acknowledging your emotions is a healthy thing to do.</li>
	<li>Talk to someone about how you are feeling. This could be your partner, a trusted family member or friend, or a professional like a counsellor.</li>
	<li>Accept your partner’s way of coping if it is different from yours. Try to let your partner do things his or her own way and find out how your partner is feeling by talking to each other and listening to each other.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Looking after yourself</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Eat healthy food, do physical activity, get as much rest as you can, and take time for things you enjoy. It is also a good idea to limit caffeine and alcohol and other drugs.</li>
	<li>Surround yourself with people who help you to feel positive.</li>
	<li>Avoid unnecessary stress, if you can. It is good to take some time off every now and then so you can do things for yourself as well.</li>
	<li>Take time to relax each day, even for just a few minutes. For example, do deep, controlled breathing, listen to your favourite music, or go for a walk around the block. You can also do breathing, music and relaxing while sitting next to your baby.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Being with your baby</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Celebrate successes, positives and progress – yours and your baby’s. Your baby might be in the NICU, but she will be reaching her own goals and milestones. There will be lots of reasons to feel positive.</li>
	<li>Getting close to your baby helps boost your own feelings of wellbeing. You can do this by getting involved in your baby’s day-to-day care.</li>
	<li>Find out how you can help your premature baby. For example, you might learn about one piece of technology or your baby’s stress signs, or about how to change a nappy gently. Just focus on one thing at a time.</li>
	<li>Remember that there are things only you as a parent can do. Your touch, smell and voice are all very important for your baby. You are also your baby’s most important advocate.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to look after yourself in these early days and weeks of your premature baby’s life. When you look after yourself, you will be in better shape to care for your baby.</p>

<h2>Ideas from other parents of premature babies: an ‘emotional wish list’</h2>

<p>Some parents of premature babies have found it helpful to write an emotional wish list to share with friends and family. Here are some thoughts from one parent’s wish list:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>My baby lives and is important to me. I need to celebrate her birth with you, no matter how sick she is.</li>
	<li>If you allow me to cry, I thank you because it allows my emotions to flow and not be bottled up in anxiety.</li>
	<li>The birth of a premature baby is not like any other pregnancy or birth, and it would be helpful if you did not compare mine to yours or to others’.</li>
	<li>Prematurity is not contagious, and I would love you not to shy away from me.</li>
	<li>Please do not expect my struggle to be over in six weeks, six months or even six years. I am coming to terms with many conflicting emotions and the future will emerge in its own time.</li>
	<li>Please do not reassure me with empty words such as, ‘The worst is over now’. Our baby might have problems in the future, and it is our job to help our baby develop while at the same time watching out for problems.</li>
	<li>I hope you understand that having a premature baby has changed me, and I don’t know if or when I’ll get back to being my old self.</li>
</ul>

<p>Families experience premature birth in different and unique ways. It helps to hear how other families cope but remember that there is no one right way to feel or respond.</p>

<h2>More than baby blues: postnatal depression after premature birth</h2>

<p><strong>Mood changes are common after you have had a baby </strong>and vary from mild to severe.</p>

<p>Many women experience a mild type of depression in the days after childbirth. If it continues and becomes more severe, it could become postnatal depression (PND). Men can suffer from PND too.</p>

<p>Signs of PND include a persistent feeling of sadness, low mood, feelings of hopelessness, lack of energy, low self-esteem and sleep problems.</p>

<p>If you think you are suffering from PND, you need emotional support from family and friends. Many parents find psychological treatments helpful, and anti-depressant medication can also help. It is a good idea to visit your GP, who can recommend the best treatment for you. Read more about PND in women and PND in men.</p>",3231,4,"43,44",59,60,"1661, 1666, 441, 511",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/premature-birth/premature-birth-feelings"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/premature-babies/premature-birth/premature-birth-feelings</a></p>

1761,Premature birth: questions to ask,"Before a premature birth, it is normal to worry about your baby and yourself.  It can help to get information about premature birth from your doctor or nurse.  You can ask about where your baby will born, and what happens during and after premature birth.","<h2>Why it is good to ask questions about premature birth</h2>

<p>It is completely understandable if you feel worried about yourself or your baby in the lead-up to a premature birth.  It can all feel out of your control.</p>

<p>One way to feel a bit more in control is to get information by <strong>working out what you need and want to know and asking some questions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Where premature babies are born</h2>

<p>One big question might be – where will I have my premature baby?</p>

<p>You’ll most likely need to give birth in a<strong> standard maternity centre in a hospital.</strong></p>

<p>If your premature baby or babies will be very early – 32 weeks or earlier – you might need to give birth in a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), rather than the hospital you’re booked into.</p>

<p>Hospitals with <strong>NICUs are usually in bigger cities</strong>. If you live in a regional, rural or remote area, you might have to go to a city hospital before the birth.</p>

<p>If your baby is born at a hospital without a NICU and needs to go to one, the hospital will have to use a <strong>specialised ambulance </strong>to transfer the baby to a hospital with a NICU. If the hospital with the NICU also has a maternity unit, you might be able to transfer there after the birth, once you can travel.  Talk to your doctor or nurse to understand how all this will happen.</p>

<h2>What will happen during and after a premature birth</h2>

<p>Knowing what to expect during a premature birth might help with some of your worries. It can help to <strong>talk to your doctor or nurse</strong> to find out more about the birth, what will happen afterwards and how the medical staff will support you. Your doctor or nurse may be able to arrange for you to talk to the medical team who will care for you and your baby.</p>

<p>Here are some questions you can ask your doctor or midwife about labour and birth and how they will support you.</p>

<p><strong>Premature labour and birth</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>I am feeling really upset about all this. It is not what I expected, and I am really worried about my baby. What can you do to help me?</li>
	<li>Will you explain things simply so that I can understand?</li>
	<li>Do you know why my labour has started, or will start, so early?</li>
	<li>Can I still have my birth preference – for example, a vaginal delivery, caesarean, no pain relief? If not, why not?</li>
	<li>I haven’t had a chance to go to any birth classes. Will you help me breathe through the contractions and manage my labour?</li>
	<li>Will I be able to get pain relief during labour?</li>
	<li>Will I need any medications? Why? What will the medications do?</li>
	<li>Will you tell me how my labour is going and how my baby is doing?</li>
	<li>Can my partner stay with me until after the baby is born?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My premature baby</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Can I see and touch my baby immediately after the birth?</li>
	<li>What will my baby look like, how big will he be, and what support will he need after the birth?</li>
	<li>Will my baby need to go to the NICU? How soon after birth?</li>
	<li>Will I or my partner be able to go to the NICU with our baby?</li>
	<li>When will I be able to hold my baby?</li>
	<li>Will my baby need any medications? Why? What will the medications do?</li>
	<li>Will my baby need any equipment? Why?</li>
	<li>Will my baby live?</li>

Clear rules encourage good behaviour and help children feel secure.You might not always get the parenting balance right. Do not be too hard on yourself. It is best not to share grown-up issues with children. Get support from family and friends instead.","<h2>Single parents raising happy, healthy children</h2>

<p>Children raised by single parents can be just as happy and mentally healthy as children living with two biological parents. Whether a child has one parent or more, children do well when they have parenting that is nurturing, warm, sensitive, responsive and flexible.</p>

<p>Parents can give their children this kind of parenting when they:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>feel confident about parenting most of the time</li>
	<li>are concerned about being a good parent</li>
	<li>understand that no-one is perfect</li>
	<li>have support from family and friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children can be frightened by the strong emotions that go along with separation. If you are a single parent experiencing separation, it is good to tell your child that both parents love him and that the separation is not his fault.</p>

<h2>Building positive relationships with children when you are a single parent</h2>

<p>Positive family relationships help children feel secure and loved. They help you feel good too.</p>

<p>Here are some ways you can nurture your relationship with your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Make the most of everyday moments.</strong> Quality time with your child can happen anytime and anywhere. You can talk at dinner instead of watching TV. You can play word games on the bus, have a singalong in the park or tell funny stories at bedtime.</li>
	<li><strong>Be interested. </strong>Talk about your child’s favourite things, from sport to music to books to how things work. Get your child to show you how to play her favourite board game or app.</li>
	<li><strong>Pay positive attention</strong>. Smile, laugh and hug your child as often as you can. Show him that you are happy to see him first thing in the morning and when he comes home from child care, kindergarten or school.</li>
	<li><strong>Make one-on-one time.</strong> If you have more than one child, try to make some regular time alone with each child. It could be a book before bed with younger children or a quiet game with an older child when the younger ones are asleep.</li>
	<li><strong>Praise your child.</strong> For example, you might say ‘I’m really proud of how you talked to me about how you are feeling’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Encouraging good behaviour when you are a single parent</h2>

<p>Clear rules and boundaries give children a sense of safety and security.</p>

<p>But it can be harder to be consistent with rules and boundaries when you are a single parent, especially if you are tired and stressed, or if your child’s behaviour is challenging.</p>

<p>If you are single parenting because of a recent separation, you might see some challenging behaviour from your child. This is pretty typical. For example, some children might go back to doing things they have grown out of, like bedwetting, baby talking, not sleeping, not eating or throwing tantrums. Your child might also be in a bad mood and argue more often.</p>

<p>Below are some ideas for encouraging good behaviour and handling challenging behaviour. And if challenging behaviour does not sort itself out in a few weeks, you can also try talking to a child health professional, like your doctor or nurse.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledge feelings </strong><br />
Encourage your child to put angry or frustrated feelings into words, and show her that you are listening. You can acknowledge these feelings without accepting inappropriate behaviour. For example, ‘I can see you’re feeling really angry – but shouting at me is not okay. Let’s take a few deep breaths together and then talk about what’s going on’.</p>

<p><strong>Create clear rules </strong><br />
Let your child know the family rules that apply when he is in your care. If you are separated, it is okay if your rules are different from your former partner’s.</p>

<p>Agreeing on some rules at a family meeting can be a good first step. This gives everyone a chance to join in, which makes it more likely that your child will follow the rules.</p>

<p><strong>Try to be consistent</strong><br />
Children behave better when they have consistent rules. Stick to your rules as much as possible and remind yourself to be calm, even if your child pushes back. If you are not always consistent – that is okay. Just work on not giving in next time.</p>

<p>If you have recently separated, it is good to keep reinforcing the same rules you encouraged before your separation.</p>

<p><strong>Choose your battles </strong><br />
Dealing with discipline issues can be exhausting when you are a single parent. It can help to choose your battles. For example, you might feel cranky if your preschooler draws on her sister’s face with markers. But if the marker washes off, does it really matter?</p>

<p>If you let the little things go, you will have more energy to act calmly when you have to deal with important issues like safety or wellbeing.</p>

<h2>Getting the parenting balance right</h2>

<p>Like all parents, you might sometimes struggle to get the parenting balance right.</p>

<p>If you find yourself being <strong>too hard </strong>– for example, shouting at your child or putting him in his room for too long – try not to get too upset with yourself. Instead, reconnect with your child and reassure him, then think about how you could handle the situation better next time.</p>

<p>It is also easy to be <strong>too soft </strong>with your child, especially if giving in gives you a bit of peace. If your family has experienced a separation or any other major family change, you might also feel reluctant to discipline your child, thinking that she has been through enough. But dealing with behaviour issues as they happen avoids problems later.</p>

<p>As a single parent, your positive attitude, strength and determination can give your child an example that lasts for life. You can show your child that you can keep going, even when things are difficult. But no parent is perfect, so do not be too hard on yourself when something goes wrong.</p>

<h2>Handling your feelings and grown-up issues</h2>

<p>Your child is bound to see you feeling sad, angry or upset in times of stress. That is normal for all parents in all families. It is important to let your child know that you love him and that your negative feelings are not about him. It can also help to reassure your child that things will get better, and you will be there for him.</p>

<p>If you feel your child is old enough to understand, try being honest about what is bothering you without going into detail. For example, ‘I had a bad day at work today. I’m in a grumpy mood’. Expressing your feelings also helps children learn to express their own.</p>

<p>As a general rule, <strong>try to keep grown-up issues out of discussions with your child</strong>. Some adult problems – like financial concerns, infidelity or conflict with a former partner – can make children feel very anxious. Use your own adult support networks, and talk things over with other adults.</p>",4901,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3581, 3586, 3591, 3596, 3601, 3606, 3611",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-diversity/parenting-after-separation-divorce/single-parenting"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-diversity/parenting-after-separation-divorce/single-parenting</a></p>",en,published
1771,Helping children adjust after separation or divorce,"It is normal for children to feel unsettled if you are going through separation or divorce.You can help your child by talking honestly, reassuring your child, and sticking with routines.Try to involve children in small decisions, get them to talk about feelings, and take time for family fun.","<h2>Children adjusting to separation and divorce</h2>

<p>Separation and divorce usually mean big changes for family life. Your child might feel upset when these changes happen. It is normal and okay for your child to feel upset, and it will help him to know that this is a tough time for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Talking with your child</strong> is one of the best ways to help him adjust to the changes in your family. There are also some practical things you can do to help, including sticking with familiar routines.</p>

<h2>Talking with your child about separation and divorce</h2>

<p>Here are some tips for talking with your child about the changes that separation and divorce bring.</p>

<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong><br />
Your child does not need to know all the details. But she does have a right to know what is happening, and she needs to know that things will be okay again.</p>

<p>It’s best if you can explain in clear, simple and honest language your child can understand. For example, ‘We both love you, and we are going to take care of you. But we have decided that it works best for our family if your father and I live apart’.</p>

<p><strong>Take your time with hard questions</strong><br />
If your child asks you a hard question like ‘Where am I going to live now?’, you could ask, ‘What have you heard?’ This helps you find out what your child already knows or does not understand.</p>

<p>Sometimes you won’t know how to answer a tough question, so give yourself time to think. If you cannot answer straight away, tell your child that you will get back to him. You could say, ‘I don’t know right now. Your father and I are still working that out. But I do know that you will get to spend time with each of us’.</p>

<p>If your child asks you tricky questions about your former partner, encourage your child to talk to your former partner directly. If your relationship with your former partner is okay, you could let your former partner know that your child has asked some questions.</p>

<p><strong>Read between the lines</strong><br />
Your child’s questions might be motivated by specific concerns. For example, if your child asks when mother is going to move back, she might be worrying about when she will see her mother. Ask your child what she is worrying about, and reassure her with simple words that show you understand. For example ‘Don’t worry – you’re still going to see your mother every week. I understand that is very important for you’.</p>

<p>Whatever question your child asks, it is good to reassure your child that you and your former partner loves him.</p>

<p><strong>Keep the conversation going</strong><br />
Your child might keep thinking about an issue, so be prepared to answer questions more than once. If you make a regular time to talk, this can give your child a chance to discuss her concerns. For example, it could be after dinner, just before you read a book or play a quiet game together. You can also use this time to let your child know about new developments.</p>

<p><strong>Talk about feelings</strong><br />
Your child will probably see you feeling sad, angry or upset. That’s natural and even healthy. It’s important to let your child know that you love him, that <strong>your feelings are not his fault</strong>, and that things will get better.</p>

<p>Seeing you express feelings in a calm and healthy way lets your child know that it’s okay for her to do this too. When your child expresses feelings, try reflecting those feelings back to her. This gives you both the chance to explore and understand her feelings better. You can say things like, ‘I can see you are upset’ or ‘I understand this makes you feel sad’.</p>

<p>It might be difficult to hear about your child’s hurt or anger, but he needs to talk too.</p>

<p><strong>Suggest someone else to talk to</strong><br />
Sometimes it is easier for children to share feelings and thoughts with someone other than their parents. You could encourage your child to talk to another trusted adult – a friend, a teacher, an aunt, uncle, cousin or grandparent. If friends and family are likely to be talking with your child, it is a good idea to ask them not to make negative comments about your former partner.</p>

<h2>Familiar routines and rituals after separation or divorce</h2>

<p>Routines help children feel secure, safe and in control, so keeping up routines can help your child cope with changes like separation and divorce.</p>

<p>Try to identify small routines that really matter to your child, like a regular playdate with a friend or a special book before bed. Let your child know that these things will not change. If possible, try not to change big things like your child’s school.</p>

<p>It is also good to maintain rituals. The way you wake your child in the morning or what you say to her at bedtime are reassuring rituals that you can easily keep up.</p>

<h2>Decision-making with children after separation or divorce</h2>

<p>If you can involve your child in small day-to-day decisions like how to arrange his room or what to have for dinner, it’ll help your child feel like he has some control.</p>

<p>With older children, you can talk about how much time they would like to spend with you or their other parent. It is important to listen carefully and let children know that their opinions matter.</p>

<h2>Fun time with children after separation or divorce</h2>

<p>Take time out to have some fun, even if it is just a quick tickle or putting on some music and dancing together. It is also good to do a few things on the spur of the moment – for example, having dinner as a picnic in the park.</p>

<h2>Support from child care, preschool or school after separation or divorce</h2>

<p>After separation or divorce, there might be changes in your child’s behaviour that are a sign she needs more support. Her teachers can watch out for these signs, or there might be things they could do to help.</p>

<p>The effects of family violence can continue after a relationship is over. Family violence can also start or get significantly worse when parents separate. Family violence of any kind is not okay. If you or anybody you know is experiencing family violence, seek help by talking to a professional like a family doctor or counsellor, talk to the police or call a helpline.</p>",3216,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3616, 3621, 3626, 3631, 3636, 3641, 3646, 3651, 3656, 3661",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-diversity/parenting-after-separation-divorce/helping-children-adjust-separation"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-diversity/parenting-after-separation-divorce/helping-children-adjust-separation</a></p>",en,published
1776,Becoming parents with IVF,"In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a medical process that might help you have a baby if you cannot conceive naturally. For some people, IVF is immediately successful. For others, the journey to parenthood can be more drawn out, with many ups and downs.","<h2>About IVF</h2>

<p>IVF is a way of bringing human eggs and sperm together outside the human body. The aim is to fertilise the eggs and create an embryo. IVF involves many steps, which take several weeks to complete.</p>

<p>If you are interested in IVF, the first step is to <strong>talk with your family doctor</strong>, who can give you some basic information about it and refer you to a specialist. You might also consider speaking to a specialist fertility counsellor about the process and journey of IVF. </p>

<p>These are the main steps in the IVF process:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ovary stimulation</strong>: if you are a woman having IVF treatment, you need to take hormones to stimulate your ovaries so that you make more than one egg per menstrual cycle.</li>
	<li><strong>Collection</strong>: healthy eggs and sperm are collected from you and your partner. Sometimes you might use a sperm or egg donor, depending on your circumstances. You will need to go to hospital and have a short procedure to have your eggs collected.</li>
	<li><strong>Fertilisation</strong>: the eggs and sperm are mixed using special equipment in a laboratory. If the sperm fertilises the egg, an embryo starts to grow.</li>
	<li><strong>Embryo transfer</strong>: the embryo is put into the uterus during a short procedure in hospital. This is usually five days after the egg collection.</li>
	<li><strong>Pregnancy test</strong>: the last step is a pregnancy test. This is done with a blood test around two weeks after the embryo transfer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chances of success with IVF</strong><br />
Your chances of falling pregnant with IVF depend on many things, including your age and health. Some women go through many rounds of IVF before they fall pregnant. For some women, IVF does not work at all.</p>

<p><strong>Costs</strong><br />
IVF can be quite expensive. Make sure you speak to your doctor or clinic about costs before you start any treatment. Different clinics might charge different prices for treatment.</p>

<p>Twins used to be very common in IVF pregnancies, because the process usually involved transferring at least two embryos. Today it is usual to transfer just a single embryo in each round of IVF.</p>

<h2>Your feelings about IVF</h2>

<p>If you have decided to try IVF, you might have been trying for a baby for quite a while. You might already be feeling frustrated and worried.</p>

<p>It is hard not to get your hopes up about falling pregnant with IVF, although you might try to tell yourself not to get too excited. If IVF is not successful in the first round, it is natural to feel disappointed. Your feelings can be even more complicated if you have gone through several rounds of IVF. You might start to wonder whether it is going to happen for you.</p>

<p>Your feelings during IVF treatment might be affected by the hormones that you have to take, which can make you feel more emotional than usual. Some parts of the treatment might affect the way you feel about your body. And some parts might leave you feeling physically uncomfortable, which can affect your emotions too.</p>

<p>The costs of IVF might cause you stress, especially if you have gone through several rounds of IVF already.</p>

<p>For all of these reasons, IVF can be a challenging experience.</p>

<p><em>Anyone who has been through the experience of infertility and then IVF will tell you it is an experience filled with emotional ups and downs, anxiety, waiting and unpleasant medical treatment that involves lots of hormone treatment. It really makes you appreciate what a miracle conception is.</em><br />
– Mother of one</p>

<h2>Help and support for people using IVF</h2>

<p>If you are feeling stress or anxiety, this is normal during IVF treatment. But you do not have to deal with it by yourself. Try talking to a trusted friend or family member about how you are feeling. It is also a very good idea to <strong>speak with your doctor</strong>, who can help you get the support you need.</p>

<p>If you are going through IVF, it is important to look after your physical health with plenty of exercise, healthy food and rest. If you feel physically well, you will be able to cope better with stress.</p>

<p>The IVF experience can sometimes put a strain on your relationship with your partner. It is important to keep talking and listening to each other as you go through the experience or seek counselling.</p>

<h2>When you have an IVF baby</h2>

<p>Looking after a newborn is hard work. But if you are a new parent with a baby conceived through IVF, you might feel that you cannot complain, and that you should just be grateful for having the baby you have always wanted.</p>

<p>It is always okay to ask for help when you need it, and there are lots of people who can help you, including <strong>your doctor</strong>.</p>

1781,Becoming a dad: adjusting to fatherhood,"Getting hands-on experience is the best way of building your skills and your confidence as a new father. Relationship changes are normal. Talking with your partner is the best way to handle these changes and look after your relationship. Parenting teamwork is good for you and good for baby. It is about communication, shared decision-making and positive problem-solving.You and your partner might need to look at your roles inside and outside the home.","<h2>New dads: getting involved with your newborn</h2>

<p>You might feel overwhelmed at first, but brand-new dads come fully equipped for fatherhood. Fathers are just as good as mothers at recognising and responding to the needs of their newborns. They are also just as able to care for older children.</p>

<p>In fact, when you care for your child, you are doing so in ways only a dad can. You probably parent in a different way from your partner, and adapting to your different parenting styles helps your baby learn social skills.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for getting involved with your baby.</p>

<p><strong>Try everything</strong><br />
Dressing, settling, playing, bathing and nappy changing – these are all great ways to bond with your baby. Parenting skills are partly a matter of practice – you get better and more confident the more hands-on experience you get.</p>

<p><strong>Keep trying</strong><br />
Resist the urge to hand your baby back to its mother when things get demanding. One-on-one time will build your confidence and skills.</p>

<p><strong>Spend one-on-one time with baby</strong><br />
This is a really important part of developing a strong and lasting bond. It is also good for your partner, who will get a much-needed break.</p>

<p><strong>Show your affection</strong><br />
When you show your baby affection and respond to your baby’s cues, a natural hormone called oxytocin is released in your baby’s brain. This hormone makes your baby feel good. It also builds connections between nerve cells, stimulating brain development.</p>

<p>You can also imitate your baby’s facial expressions – frowns, tongue-poking, sounds and smiles. All this helps the bonding and attachment between you and your baby.</p>

<p><strong>Talk with your baby</strong><br />
While you are caring for your baby, try talking to your baby about what you are doing. For example, ‘Let’s get dressed now – on goes your top’. Using a warm, sing-song voice helps your newborn feel content and protected.</p>

<p>Talk is like brain food for babies. It helps them build language and communication skills from the time they are born. Babies do not have to understand words to benefit from talking.</p>

<p><strong>Make time for play</strong><br />
Playing with your newborn is not about games and toys – it is about the interactions between you and your baby. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Give your baby tummy time each day</strong>. It helps your baby’s muscle and brain development. If your baby does not like it, just try it for a short time.  (Remember that a baby should sleep on its back and not on the tummy.)</li>
	<li><strong>Play with words, songs, rhymes and stories</strong> to build language and memory skills. Start with some old favourites that you heard as a child.  </li>
	<li><strong>Try peek-a-boo</strong>. Simple play like this builds your relationship and also lays the foundations for your baby’s language, thinking, motor skills, and social and emotional development.</li>
</ul>

<p>High levels of father involvement have been linked to better social and academic skills in their children. And it is never too late to get involved!</p>

<h2>Looking after your relationship</h2>

<p>Most couples notice relationship changes after their baby arrives. At first, it is very exciting, and couples often feel closer. But after about a month, couples often start feeling more tired, stressed and overwhelmed by child care demands and household chores.</p>

<p>Sometimes, they discover they have different ideas about family life or parenting.</p>

<p><strong>Talking with your partner</strong> is the best way to deal with these changes and look after your relationship.  Read other articles on how to cope with stress and how to relax.</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p>Up to 15% of women and 10% of men develop postnatal depression (PND). Read more about PND and women and PND and men. If you think you or your partner is experiencing PND, see a health professional as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Understanding your changing sexual relationship</h2>

<p>Baby’s arrival can change your sexual relationship with your partner. Both you and your partner might want to feel close again. But having sex can sometimes be difficult because of tiredness, physical changes after childbirth, changes in the way your partner feels sexually, or postnatal depression (PND).</p>

<p>Most couples do get their sexual relationship back on track. Here are a few things that might help this along:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Be patient.</strong> You are both going through major changes. It is important to reassure your partner and try to understand your partner’s feelings. Often, couples are advised to wait until the six-week postnatal check-up before having sex again. Everyone is different, though, and some mothers might need to wait longer.</li>
	<li><strong>Find other ways to be intimate.</strong> Try showing your love with extra kisses or cuddles, holding hands, giving massages or taking a bath together. Even a brief touch as you pass each other in the kitchen or get things from the car can remind you of your bond.</li>
	<li><strong>Share the load.</strong> When you get involved in taking care of the baby or you take on extra household chores, it gives your partner more time to recover.</li>
</ul>

<p>These can be difficult issues to talk about. If you are finding it difficult, you might want to see a counsellor together.</p>

<h2>Parenting as a team</h2>

<p>Parenting as a team means working towards shared parenting values, making decisions together, solving problems constructively, and resolving conflicts calmly.</p>

<p>Parental teamwork has several benefits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you and your partner handle the challenges and rewards of parenting together, you are stronger and better equipped to make tough decisions.</li>
	<li>Children learn how to behave from watching the way you interact with each other. When you meet challenges, solve problems and handle conflicts in positive and cooperative ways, you’re modelling good behaviour.</li>
	<li>When your baby sees or senses you talking and working well together, your baby feels safe and secure. And this might even mean that your baby cries less.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the early days, the key is to <strong>stay positive and support each other</strong> as you learn how to parent together. These tips can help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Listen to your partner’s interests and concerns. Mothers often say they value the chance to share what is happening – good and bad – with someone who really cares.</li>
	<li>Be ready to step in when you are needed, so your partner can take a break.</li>
	<li>Back each other up in front of your children, and discuss disagreements when the children are not around.</li>
	<li>Keep unwanted advice to yourself – sometimes your partner will just want to offload stress by talking to a caring listener.</li>
	<li>Make a regular time to share ideas for dealing with problems – ideally a time when you are both rested and unstressed.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more information, read up on the importance of teamwork, backing each other up, managing conflict and solving problems together.</p>

<h2>Working out new roles as parents</h2>

<p>It is important for couples to discuss their roles both inside and outside the home. For example, if a father wants to be closely involved with his children, he might be unhappy working for long hours every weekday. Similarly, it is not healthy for a mother to be at home full-time if her work is important to her and she is unhappy without it.</p>

<p>Here are some starting points for talking:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>What needs to be done?</strong> Make a list of your family’s requirements, whether it is caring for the baby, doing shopping and laundry, cooking, washing dishes or earning money. This will give you a starting point for planning who can do what.</li>
	<li><strong>How much does each of you want or need to work?</strong> Try to look at facts like who earns more, as well as feelings about staying home with your baby.</li>
	<li><strong>How much money do you need?</strong> Drawing up a family budget might help you decide whether one or both of you can afford to cut down your work hours to spend more time at home, if that is what you want to do.</li>
	<li><strong>Whose job is more flexible?</strong> You might find that one employer is more family friendly than the other. This can make a big difference when you head back to work.</li>
	<li><strong>What will make you happy?</strong> It doesn’t matter who takes which roles in the family, as long as you both feel happy and fulfilled.</li>

It is important to look after yourself too. Our 10 tips below can help you make a positive start to fatherhood.","<h1><strong>Life as a new dad</strong></h1>

<p>Becoming a dad will probably be one of the biggest events of your life.</p>

<p>If you are going through the intense emotions – not to mention lack of sleep – that often come with a new baby, you might be wondering <strong>where to start and what to do</strong>. You might even be thinking your partner has everything under control, and feeling unsure of what is left for you to do.</p>

<p>First, it is important to know that you have strong innate capacities to bond with, relate with and care for your child. Newborn babies come into the world ready to connect with both their parents.As a dad, <strong>you are going to have a huge impact</strong> on your child’s life. And that impact starts now. Caring for your child will also enhance your own emotional well-being.</p>

<p>Before your child is born, you must plan to take advantage of parental leave policies, manage your work hours, etc to make sure you are ready to dedicate adequate time for child care and share care and household responsibilities with your partner. This is a great way to start your life as a dad. In the longer term, though, there is a bigger pay-off for using this time to <strong>begin your relationship with your child</strong>.</p>

<p>Becoming a dad can be a steep learning curve. It might help to hear from other dads in videos on bonding, changing nappies, holding your baby and helping with your baby. Do not hesitate to join fathers’ groups, parental training sessions, discussions with health care workers, etc if available to get more support along your parenting journey.</p>

<p><strong>1. Get hands on from the beginning</strong><br />
Your baby is ready to bond with you from birth. Getting involved in the daily care of your baby – dressing, settling, playing, bathing and nappy changing – is the best way to build your skills and confidence. These everyday activities also create lots of one-on-one time with your baby, which is the building block of a positive relationship. Both parents can plan to share these responsibilities from the start.</p>

<p><strong>2. Learn your baby’s cues </strong><br />
Babies give ‘cues’ or signals to what they need through their behaviour and body language. By really paying attention to your baby’s cues, over time you will learn how to work out what your baby needs.</p>

<p><strong>3. Connect through touch</strong><br />
Physical touch makes your baby feel safe and secure and builds trust and connection with you. This kind of bonding with newborns also stimulates your baby’s brain development. You could try carrying and holding your baby as often as you can. If you hold her to your chest, she can hear your heartbeat. Paternal skin-to-skin contact, also known as kangaroo care, particularly for newborns has proved to have health benefits for children.</p>

<p><strong>4. Talk to your baby as often as you can</strong><br />
Talk while you are carrying or changing your baby. For example, ‘Let’s get this nappy changed. That feels better, doesn’t it? Here’s a nice clean nappy. Don’t cry – we’ll be finished soon’. Every word baby hears helps develop her/his language and learning and strengthens your relationship with her/him. Telling stories, reading books or singing songs has the same effect.</p>

<p><strong>5. Help with breastfeeding</strong><br />
Breastmilk is the best food for your baby. Your support for breastfeeding can be vital while your partner is learning. You could give practical support – a glass of water, another pillow or whatever she needs. Or if she is having trouble, you could encourage her to get help. If your partner finds she cannot breastfeed, you could reassure her and seek appropriate advice.</p>

<p><strong>6. Have some one-on-one time</strong><br />
This kind of time is about you and your baby. If you can create moments when your baby has your full attention, you can really tune in to your baby. This gives the two of you a chance to connect and bond. For example, it can be as simple as making faces at each other while you dress your baby.</p>

<p><strong>7. Get the information that you need</strong><br />
Whether it is your first or second baby, there are always new things to learn. You can find information by searching the internet, talking with other dads and attending parenting groups, for example. And one of the best ways to learn is by doing – spending lots of time caring for your baby.</p>

<p><strong>8. Accept or ask for help</strong><br />
If someone says, ‘Is there anything I can do?’, it is okay to say ‘Yes!’ Talk with your partner about when you will accept help from family, friends, colleagues or neighbours. It might be as simple as asking someone to buy some bread for you when they come over to visit. Moreover, when in doubt do not hesitate to reach out for professional help from health workers.</p>

<p><strong>9. Look after your relationship</strong><br />
Having a new baby can put extra strain on your relationship with your partner. Try to stay positive and support each other as you learn how to parent together. Asking how your partner is doing lets your partner know you care. Negotiating and sharing expectations is good practice for later parenting. This can be about everything from deciding on paid work arrangements to who cooks dinner. Sharing child care and household responsibilities helps reduce stress and distribute the sudden increase in burden of work. Support one another in creating a positive, nurturing and caring environment in the household.</p>

<p><strong>10. Look after yourself</strong><br />
If you are well, you will be better able to look after your baby and support your partner. You can keep your energy up with healthy lifestyle choices and as much sleep and rest as you can – even if it’s not at night. Make sure to make time for yourself and address your personal needs.</p>

1791,Breastfeeding: how partners can help,"Breastfeeding is something that you and your partner can do as a team. Your knowledge and support will help your partner as she learns to breastfeed. Learn about the benefits of breastfeeding, how breastfeeding works and how to get help for your partner if she needs it. Look for practical ways to help out with your baby and take on extra household chores.","<h2>Why it is important for partners to support breastfeeding mothers</h2>

<p>Breastfeeding is something that you and your partner can do as a team.</p>

<p>Your knowledge, enthusiasm and support can be crucial as your partner learns how to breastfeed. And if your partner is finding it hard to breastfeed, you can boost her confidence and help her overcome challenges. This can make it more likely that she will breastfeed for longer.</p>

<h2>What to do first: learn about breastfeeding</h2>

<p>One of the most important things you can do is learn about the benefits of breastfeeding and how breastfeeding works. This way, you will be able to help your partner remember important information and identify and manage breastfeeding issues early.</p>

<p>Here are <strong>key things to know about breastfeeding</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Breastmilk is a nutritious, natural food for your baby. Breastfeeding gives your baby extra protection against infection and disease, and reduces your partner’s risk of some diseases. It is also free and convenient!</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding is not always quick. For new mothers, each feeding session can last anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. Most newborns feed 8-12 times a day.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding takes time to learn, and it is not always easy. Getting attachment (of the baby's mouth to the mother's nipple) right and finding a good breastfeeding position are important.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your partner might face one of these common breastfeeding issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>not enough breastmilk supply</li>
	<li>too much breastmilk</li>
	<li>breast refusal and baby biting</li>
	<li>sore nipples and nipple infections</li>
	<li>mastitis and blocked milk ducts.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your partner is having trouble with breastfeeding, you and she can get support from your health nurse or doctor. These professionals can also help you with good advice.</p>

<h2>How to help with a breastfeeding baby</h2>

<p>Although you are not breastfeeding your baby, there are many ways you can help out with your baby and nurture the bond between you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carry your baby in a sling or baby carrier, or just hold your baby. Cuddling skin to skin can help settle your baby and bond with your baby.</li>
	<li>Bath your baby or massage your baby. This can be soothing for your baby and a great time for bonding between you.</li>
	<li>Settle your baby. This might be easier for you than your breastfeeding partner. When your baby is fussy, the smell of milk on your partner can make your baby search for her breasts instead of calming down.</li>
	<li>Take your baby for a burp and nappy change after a breastfeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a new baby in your family, it is easy to forget about your own needs. But it is important to look after yourself with healthy eating, some physical activity and sleep when you can get it. This will give you the energy you need to be the parent you want to be.</p>

<h2>Caring for a breastfeeding mother</h2>

<p>New breastfeeding mothers have a lot to deal with. It is normal for your partner to feel anxious, tired and physically uncomfortable, as well as excited and happy about your new baby. Here are ways you can help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Look for practical ways to care for your partner while she is breastfeeding. Offer to bring her a glass of water, give her another pillow if she needs one, or remove distractions like older siblings, visitors or the family pet.</li>
	<li>Bring your baby to your partner in bed for night feeds and settle him back to sleep if you need to. This will be a big help to your partner, even if you only do it for some night feeds, or on some nights.</li>
	<li>Be patient if your partner does not feel like being intimate with you. She is probably tired and distracted from feeding, carrying and settling your baby many times a day.</li>
	<li>Encourage your partner to drink plenty of water, and make sure there is plenty of healthy food at home for her to eat. Breastfeeding will make her hungry and thirsty.</li>
	<li>Take on extra housework, and try to make sure you are home as much as possible to do things like cooking and washing. If you can do household chores without being asked to, it means your partner does not have to worry about them at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let your partner know she is doing a great job and that you appreciate her breastfeeding efforts and achievements. And if breastfeeding does not work out despite her best efforts, seek for advice from a health professional.</p>",4616,4,"43,44,45,46",59,37,"2676, 1676, 5086",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/fathers/getting-involved/breastfeeding-partners-can-help"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/fathers/getting-involved/breastfeeding-partners-can-help</a></p>",en,published
1796,Special dad time: how to make it happen,"As a father, you have a big impact on your children’s development. The most significant contribution you make is through your everyday interactions with your kids. Here is how to get some special dad time into your routine.","<h2>Creating high-quality dad time with your children</h2>

<p>High-quality interactions with your children happen when you do that little bit more than simply caring for them. But it can be hard to find the time when you are juggling long work hours, time for yourself and time with your partner.</p>

<p>Here are some simple ways to make ‘dad time’ even more special:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Talk to your children.</strong> Tell them stories and jokes. Listening to grown-ups talk helps babies and young children learn, even if they cannot understand what you are saying. It also brings you closer emotionally.</li>
	<li>Read with your children. Reading aloud with your children is a great way to spend time together. Even better, reading and storytelling helps promote language, literacy and brain development.</li>
	<li><strong>Explain things.</strong> Point out things that are worth noticing or remembering – for example, a digger on a building site, or a bird in the backyard. Explain how they work if your child asks questions.</li>
	<li><strong>Why talking is important</strong>. Moments when your children have your exclusive attention are truly golden. If you stop what you are doing and give your child your full attention, you are also giving a great boost to his development and self-esteem.</li>
	<li><strong>Be a good role model.</strong> Your child learns how to interact with others through her interactions with you. Every parent has to say ‘no’ and ‘don’t’ sometimes, but even these can be ‘learning moments’ if you are clear about the behaviour you want. Praise your child when she cooperates, and model politeness. This gives her a powerful example to follow.</li>
	<li><strong>Create challenging learning opportunities.</strong> If you watch carefully, you will work out how to keep a game just within your child’s ability – not too hard, not too easy. For example, you might point to where a puzzle piece could go, rather than letting him struggle, or just doing it for him.</li>
	<li><strong>Offer choices when you can.</strong> For example, instead of saying, ‘Put your t-shirt on’, you could say, ‘Do you want to wear the red t-shirt or the green one?’ A choice is a good alternative to an instruction. It helps build independence and encourage responsibility, and gives your child the feeling she has some control in decision-making.</li>
	<li><strong>Use your sense of humour</strong> when you are reading or explaining things. Tease playfully. Humour and playfulness can help children’s wellbeing as they grow.</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that you do not need special training to make these interactions happen. Chances are you are already doing lots of good things. Not every minute with your children will be high quality, but knowing what great interactions look like will help you create more of them.</p>

<p>Warmth and physical affection from fathers is associated with higher self-esteem and fewer social and emotional problems in their children.</p>

<h2>Rough-and-tumble play</h2>

<p>Rough-and-tumble play can be fun for children and grown-ups, and it can be a dad specialty.</p>

<p>As well as giving children the chance to get some exercise, rough-and-tumble play lets them safely test their physical capabilities and limits. It also helps children learn how to be strong without being aggressive. And when they’re playing rough with their dads, children can learn how to manage emotions like anger and excitement, as well as the desire to win. This type of play also helps your child learn important social lessons, like what is ‘fair’.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for getting the most out of rough-and-tumble play with your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Time your play wisely. Kids playing with dad can get so excited they need some quiet time before they can go to bed, eat a meal or get dressed. Make time for winding down after rough play.</li>
	<li>Set a few ground rules. For example, when someone says they have had enough or gets hurt, it is time to take a break.</li>
	<li>When the occasional bump or collision happens, calm things down, make sure your child understands it was an accident, and start the game again after the tears are dry.</li>
	<li>Encourage your children to keep trying when they ‘lose’.</li>
	<li>And remember – as the strongest and biggest player, you might have to let yourself be overpowered or caught so another player can ‘win’ at least some of the time!</li>

1801,Postnatal depression and your partner: how to help,"Watch for signs of postnatal depression in your partner, including changes in your partner’s emotions, thinking or behaviour. If your partner gets early professional help for PND, it can mean a quicker recovery. Support your partner by sharing baby care and housework, listening to your partner and keeping her company. Look after yourself too.","<h2>Postnatal depression: watching for the signs</h2>

<p>Although having a new baby is a joyful and exciting experience, it is common to feel up and down after birth. For example, you might feel stressed and overwhelmed as you and your partner learn how to look after your new baby – while coping with a lack of sleep and much less time to yourselves.</p>

<p>But <strong>postnatal depression is more than stress or tiredness</strong> – it lasts longer than a few days and can be a serious mental health problem.</p>

<p>This is why it is important to watch out for the signs of postnatal depression in your partner. These signs might include changes in your partner’s emotions and thinking, behaviour and social life, and general physical wellbeing. And if <strong>your partner seems to be in a low mood or has lost interest in things</strong> she would normally enjoy, you should take this very seriously.</p>

<p>Talking with your partner often and asking how she is feeling will help you both be aware of any changes.</p>

<p>If the emotional changes in your partner go on for longer than two weeks and get in the way of daily life, you need to help your partner get professional advice.</p>

<p>If you believe that someone’s life is in immediate danger, call the local emergency services or go to your local hospital’s emergency department.</p>

<h2>Getting professional support for postnatal depression</h2>

<p>Postnatal depression can take a long time to go away without professional help. Early professional support can help your partner recover sooner.</p>

<p>There are many <strong>people and services who can help</strong> your partner and family with postnatal depression, such as your doctor, your nurse, and your local health centre.</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
</ul>

<p>Some women might not want to seek help because they are worried about what other people might think. They might also want to keep up the appearance of having everything under control. These are all normal reactions. Reassure your partner that you will be there to support her.</p>

<h2>Emotional support for your partner with postnatal depression</h2>

<p>It’s common for new mothers to feel emotional as they go through the physical and practical changes of pregnancy and birth. You can give your partner a lot of support just by <strong>listening to her and reassuring her</strong> that things will get better.</p>

<p>Also, looking after a new baby is a big job. It is demanding and tiring. So it is really important to talk with your partner about how she is feeling and to <strong>let her know that you appreciate what a great job she is doing</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>acknowledge that she might be tired</strong>. For example, you might say, ‘Thanks for caring for our baby. I know it is hard and you are really tired, and I appreciate everything you are doing’.</p>

<p>There might be some setbacks while your partner and health professional learn what treatments work best for her. You can reassure your partner that setbacks are part of the process, and that you will support her as she overcomes them.</p>

<h2>Practical support for your partner with postnatal depression</h2>

<p>All new parents need practical help and support, especially parents who are experiencing postnatal depression.</p>

<p>You can do a lot to <strong>help your partner in practical ways</strong> during this time:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Share the care of your baby and take on extra baby care if you can. This can give your partner more time to care for herself.</li>
	<li>Take on more housework. If you can do household chores without being asked to, it means your partner does not have to worry about them at all.</li>
	<li>Keep your partner company. Quality couple and family time will help her recover. You can do things together like cooking meals or going for walks.</li>
	<li>Arrange for someone else to be around if you cannot be there. It should be someone your partner feels comfortable spending time with, like a relative or close friend.</li>
	<li>Accept help from family and friends. You can also let people know that your family needs extra support right now and suggest what they can do to help. People often appreciate being asked for something specific.</li>
	<li>Help your partner with her appointments. For example, you can arrange her appointments, drive her to appointments, go to appointments with her, arrange child care and so on.</li>
	<li>Do your research. The more you learn about postnatal depression, the better you can support your partner. You can ask health professionals for more information.</li>
	<li>Celebrate when your partner makes progress in her recovery. For example, if you notice that your partner is getting out of the house more often, do something special like looking after baby so she can get some sleep or have coffee with a friend.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your partner might feel guilty or feel like a burden for accepting your help. You can gently reassure your partner that her wellbeing is important to you and your family.</p>

<h2>Looking after yourself when your partner with postnatal depression</h2>

<p>You might be focused on your partner’s wellbeing, but it is also important to take time for yourself as well. If you are emotionally and physically well, you will be in better shape to support your partner.</p>

<p>For example, you could do some physical activity by taking your baby out for a walk in the pram. This also gives your partner a little break – and possibly the chance to catch up on some much-needed sleep.</p>

<p>Eating healthy food helps you and your partner build the energy you need to care for your baby and support each other.  </p>

<p>Supporting a partner with depression can cause strain in your relationship and affect your own wellbeing. It can help to share how you are feeling with a relative, friend or health professional.</p>

<p>Men can also experience postnatal depression. The strategies suggested in this article can help both men and women who are suffering from postnatal depression.  Looking after yourself can help to reduce this risk.

1811,New mums and dads: healthy lifestyle choices,"Congratulations on your new baby! Although you are focused on your newborn, it is also important to look after yourself with healthy lifestyle choices. This will help keep you in good shape to care for your baby.","<h2>Healthy eating and drinking in the early days</h2>

<p>Looking after a new baby takes up a huge amount of time and energy.</p>

<p>This means you will probably have less time for shopping and for preparing and cooking snacks and meals. But eating well goes a long way towards helping you keep your energy levels up.</p>

<p>For good health, you need to eat a wide variety of foods every day from five main food groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>vegetables – 6 servings a day for men and 5 servings a day for women</li>
	<li>fruit – 2 servings a day for men and women</li>
	<li>grain foods – 6 servings a day for men and women</li>
	<li>protein – 3 servings a day for men and 2½ serving a day for women</li>
	<li>reduced-fat dairy – 2½ servings a day for men and women.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important to <strong>drink plenty of water – eight glasses a day is the recommended amount</strong>. It is okay to have juice, cordial or a soft drink sometimes, but they are high in sugar so water is the healthiest choice.</p>

<p>If you are breastfeeding, your body needs extra nutrients, which you can get from a healthy breastfeeding diet.</p>

<h2>Healthy eating tips for new parents</h2>

<p>Here are a few tips for <strong>quick, easy and healthy eating options</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Keep pre-washed and pre-chopped vegetables in the refrigerator.</li>
	<li>Prepare meals in bulk and freeze them – for example, casseroles and soups.</li>
	<li>Use frozen vegetables when you do not have time to prepare fresh vegetables.</li>
	<li>Keep your fruit basket full.</li>
	<li>Have yoghurt, nuts, and vegetable sticks handy for healthy snacks during the day.</li>
	<li>Make meals that can be eaten hot or cold. You can also pack these into containers for outings.</li>
	<li>If possible, shop online and use grocery delivery services.</li>
	<li>Accept offers of meals from friends and family.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Physical activity for new parents</h2>

<p>Even though you might feel tired and want to rest every chance you get, exercise can actually increase your energy levels and make you feel better. <strong>Movement is what matters – 30 minutes or so a day.</strong></p>

<p>It can be hard to find the time to fit this in, but you can try making it part of everyday activities. For example, pushing your baby’s pram to the shops to pick up some things for dinner gets you out of the house and keeps you active too.</p>

<p>You do not need to join a gym to exercise. Learn a few exercises that you can do from home or go for a walk or run from home. Then you will not have to worry about the travel time involved in going to the gym.</p>

<p>Some women worry about losing the weight they gained during the pregnancy. It is important to give your body time to recover after your baby is born. Healthy food and gentle exercise make for a sensible approach.</p>

<h2>Alcohol, smoking and medication</h2>

<p><strong>Caring for your baby safely</strong><br />
Check with your doctor or pharmacist about whether any <strong>medications</strong> that you or your partner take – including herbal tonics or tablets – have side effects that could make it hard to care for your baby. This might include anything that causes drowsiness, affects your balance or affects your reflexes – for example, when driving a car.</p>

<p>Now that you are caring for a newborn, you will need to plan who will look after the baby if you are drinking alcohol or taking medication that can make you drowsy or affect your balance.</p>

<p><strong>Alcohol and smoking</strong><br />
<strong>No more than two standard alcoholic drinks each day</strong> is a healthy level.</p>

1821,How to sleep better: for parents,It is the topic most parents talk about – sleep. How much sleep are you getting? Are you getting enough? Here is how to sleep better when you are a parent.,"<h2>Sleep in the early days of parenthood</h2>

<p>If you have never had a period of bad sleeping before, you might get a shock at just how much lack of sleep can affect your life. New parents often say they did not believe it would be as bad as it is.</p>

<p>It can take a while for babies to settle into a regular routine, and this makes getting the sleep and rest you need difficult. In the early weeks, getting any extra sleep might be hard.</p>

<h2>How much sleep you need</h2>

<p>In general, adults need <strong>about 7-8 hours</strong> of sleep a night to feel properly rested, although this varies from 5-10 hours, depending on the person.</p>

<p>You might need more sleep if you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>find it difficult to wake up in the morning, or feel sleepy all of the time</li>
	<li>cannot concentrate</li>
	<li>feel moody, irritable, depressed or anxious</li>
	<li>are unintentionally having micro-sleeps during the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just as your child needs sleep to stay well, you need enough sleep to get on with and enjoy parenting. Proper rest helps you do this, and makes you feel happier and calmer. Also, your baby responds to how you feel, which means your baby will feel more contented too.</p>

<h2>How to sleep better and feel more rested</h2>

<p>Getting enough sleep during the first few months of your baby’s life can be hard. How much sleep you get depends a fair bit on what is happening with your child. But there are some things you can do to feel more rested.</p>

<p><strong>Before bed </strong><br />
These tips can help you get a better night’s sleep:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Establish a regular bedtime routine.</li>
	<li>Find ways to switch off and wind down before bed – for example, read a book, listen to some gentle music, or use relaxation techniques like deep breathing.</li>
	<li>Avoid tea, coffee, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate and other stimulants close to bedtime. They make resting and sleeping harder and affect how well you sleep.</li>
	<li>Avoid using screens in your bedroom, including television, mobile phones and tablets.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In bed </strong><br />
It can be hard to wind down after a long day, or to switch your mind off so you can sleep. If you are having trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep, try not to get worried and frustrated. Instead, try reminding yourself that it is okay that you are comfortable and restful in bed.</p>

<p>If this does not work, it might be worth getting up and writing down what is on your mind. Then you can try going through your bedtime routine again.</p>

<p><strong>During the day </strong><br />
Making time for yourself can help you feel better. Even just five minutes reading a book, walking around the block or doing some meditation can give you the sense of being rested when you are not getting enough sleep.</p>

<p>It is possible to ‘catch up’ on missed sleep, so nap during the day when you can. You can also make up for missed sleep during the week by sleeping more on the weekend.</p>

<p>Physical activity and healthy food can give you more energy, so make time for exercise and eating well – every little bit helps.</p>

<p><strong>Daily routines </strong><br />
If you can, share baby care with your partner (so you both feel as rested as possible), a family member or a friend.</p>

<p>Taking turns or shifts for night-time duties can really make a difference. This might be harder for mothers who are breastfeeding. In this case, the key is to try to rest when your baby is resting. On weekends, you could take turns having sleep-ins or naps during the day.</p>

<p>Using your energy for the things that are most important to you can help you feel better about your day – even if you are tired at the end of it. For example, you might choose to play with your children or spend time with family or friends rather than do the vacuuming.</p>

<p>There will be some daily chores that you just have to do, and even the easiest chores can feel overwhelming when you are exhausted. If you <strong>break chores down into small steps</strong> and focus on one thing at a time, they can seem more manageable – and you can give yourself a reward for finishing each step. But sometimes chores might just have to wait, no matter how important they are.</p>

<p><strong>Lowering your expectations</strong> can take the pressure off. Sometimes what we expect of ourselves can be unrealistic. For example, we might expect that we can play with the children, go to work, help at child care or school, cook an amazing dinner, get three loads of washing done, and still go to the gym.</p>

<p>There are times when you can do all these things. But there might be some days or even weeks when you are feeling low on energy, and you might need to rethink how much you can get done – and that is okay. When you chat with other parents, you will find that they have these times too.</p>

<p>If you are struggling to manage daily routines on not enough sleep, it is okay to ask family or friends for help. And if you feel that lack of sleep is affecting you mentally or emotionally, it is a very good idea to talk with your doctor or another health professional.</p>",4086,4,"43,44,45,46",59,60,"96, 1761, 1766",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/sleep-for-parents"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/sleep-for-parents</a></p>",en,published
1826,New mums: your body after birth,"The first week after birth is an important time for getting to know your new baby, resting and recovering. It is normal to have vaginal bleeding, soreness and afterpains. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you are having difficulty with the pain. Your body will change in the first few months after birth. For example, you might have urinary and bowel incontinence, hair loss and stretch marks. If you have breastfeeding problems, talk to your doctor or nurse.","<h2>New mothers: your body in the first week after birth</h2>

<p>The first week after your baby’s birth is a time for you to care for and get to know your new baby.</p>

<p>You will have some vaginal bleeding and soreness around your vagina or caesarean wound. You might also have afterpains and nipple or breast tenderness. That is why the first week or so after birth is also a time for you to <strong>rest and recover as much as you can.</strong></p>

<p>Talk to your doctor if pain is making it hard for you to rest, sleep or care for yourself or your baby. Your health professional can help you with pain relief medication. It is also a good idea to ask any other questions you have about yourself or your baby.</p>

<h2>Vaginal bleeding</h2>

<p>You will have some <strong>vaginal bleeding</strong>. This starts straight after birth and lasts for 4-6 weeks. The bleeding usually eases off over the first weeks and changes from bright red to red-brown.</p>

<p>You will need to use pads rather than tampons. You might prefer to use maternity pads at first – these are larger and longer than regular pads. The bleeding might increase for a short time when you are breastfeeding or walking.</p>

<p>If your perineum feels hot or becomes more swollen, or if there is a <strong>bad smell</strong> associated with vaginal bleeding, check with your doctor. These changes can be a sign of infection.</p>

<h2>Pain after vaginal birth</h2>

<p>You might be sore after a vaginal birth, even if you have not had any tearing or stitches. This is because the muscles and nerves around your perineum have been stretched and bruised.</p>

<p>There are several things you can try to help with pain, swelling and bruising of your perineum:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Put ice packs or cold gel packs on the area for 10-20 minutes, no more than every two hours.</li>
	<li>Lie on your side and do some pelvic floor exercises.</li>
	<li>Take some paracetamol or other mild pain relief. Ask your doctor which pain relievers are best for you, especially if you are breastfeeding.</li>
	<li>Keep the area clean by showering or bathing daily, and changing your pad regularly.</li>
	<li>Gently pat the area dry with a soft towel or cloth after each wash.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it <strong>hurts to urinate</strong>, tell your doctor. This might be caused by grazes on your perineum. You could try:</p>

<ul>
	<li>pouring a cup of warm water over your genitals when you urinate</li>
	<li>using a urinary alkaliniser</li>
	<li>drinking plenty of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have stitches to repair a tear or an episiotomy, these will dissolve gradually 1-2 weeks after the birth.</p>

<h2>Pain after caesarean birth</h2>

<p>After a caesarean birth, you will have a surgical wound in the lower part of your tummy. It is normal for the wound to be sore.</p>

<p>It can help to <strong>support your wound</strong> with pillows under your knees when lying on your back, or under your tummy when lying on your side. When you sit up from a lying position, roll onto your side and use your arms to raise your upper body from the mattress.</p>

<p>Your doctor will tell you to <strong>limit vigorous exercise and activity </strong>after a caesarean birth. It is best to avoid tasks that involve lifting, carrying and driving in the first few weeks. You can ask your friends and family to help you with these tasks.</p>

<p>A gentle walk each day can help your body heal. You should also get as much sleep and rest as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Loose-fitting clothing</strong> and cotton underwear with a high waist will probably be more comfortable on your wound.</p>

<p>The size of a caesarean scar is different for each woman, but your wound will appear smaller in the first few weeks after birth as the bruising and swelling settle down.</p>

<p>If your wound or the area around it becomes red, feels warm to touch, or is oozing, it might be infected. You should see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Afterpains</h2>

<p>Afterpains are short cramps caused by your uterus contracting to get smaller and control bleeding. You might get afterpains while you are breastfeeding because the hormones released when you breastfeed also make the uterus contract. This helps your uterus to get smaller and get back to how it was before you were pregnant.</p>

<p>Afterpains are uncomfortable and can last a couple of days. <strong>Warm packs</strong> on your tummy or your back can help.</p>

<p>Afterpains are more common in women who have given birth before, but you can have them after your first birth too. They generally get stronger with each birth.</p>

<h2>Breast and nipple soreness</h2>

<p>You can expect sore nipples and tender breasts in the first week as your milk comes in and you and your baby learn to breastfeed.</p>

<p>The most common reason for soreness is your baby not attaching properly to your breast. With good attachment, this will usually settle down. Ask for help from your health professional if you are not sure, or you are very sore.</p>

<p>Here are some other things you can do to help with breast and nipple tenderness:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Put some cool packs on your breasts – even a frozen damp cloth can help between feeds. A warm cloth during feeds will encourage milk flow.</li>
	<li>Try gently massaging full breasts.</li>
	<li>Express a few drops of your milk at the end of each feed and spread it over your nipples. This can soothe sore nipples and help them to heal.</li>
	<li>Try putting a small amount of cream on your nipples. Use one that’s specially made for breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your breast and nipple soreness does not get better each day, you can talk to a health professional.</p>

<h2>Urinary and bowel incontinence in the first few months after birth</h2>

<p>In the early months after birth, you might find that you accidentally urinate or have accidental bowel motions, especially when you laugh, cough or sneeze.</p>

<p>This will usually fix itself as your swelling goes down, sensation comes back and muscles get stronger. Pelvic floor exercises to strengthen your muscles can help.</p>

<p>If you are still having problems with incontinence when your baby is six weeks old or older, talk to your doctor, who will be able to help or send you to a women’s health physiotherapist or continence specialist.</p>

<p>Incontinence after birth is very common and there are many treatments that can help.</p>

<h2>Weight in the first few months after birth</h2>

<p>Weight loss normally happens gradually after birth. Healthy eating and gentle exercise like walking can help with losing weight. Breastfeeding can help too.</p>

<p>Weight loss is safest when you take it slowly. If your goal is to return to your pre-pregnancy weight, you can expect this to take several months.</p>

<p>If you were overweight before you got pregnant and you would like to lose weight, talk with your health professional. If you are losing too much weight and are underweight, it is also a good idea to talk with your health professional.</p>

<h2>Hair in the first few months after birth</h2>

<p>You might lose some hair from your head in the months after giving birth. This will not last and should settle down when your baby is about six months old.</p>

<p>It happens because of changing hormone levels in your body. Hair loss is not caused by breastfeeding, so weaning your baby will not help.</p>

<h2>Stretch marks</h2>

<p>You might have stretch marks on your tummy, hips and breasts during pregnancy. After the birth, the marks usually change, fading from a red to a silvery colour and getting smaller.</p>

<p>Your health and your baby’s health will be reviewed at a six-week check-up with your doctor. This is a chance for you to ask about any physical or emotional changes that are worrying you.</p>

<h2>Your relationship in the early months of parenthood</h2>

<p>Becoming parents is a big change for you and your partner. Some couples find a deeper connection, but others need time to nurture their relationship as parents.</p>

<p>Your feelings about sex and intimacy can depend on many things – your birth experience, pain, tiredness, the demands of caring for your baby and how you feel about your body after pregnancy and birth.</p>

<p>It can really help to share experiences and ideas. You could try connecting with other new mothers by going to a mothers group. If you are not sure where to find one, ask your home visiting nurse.</p>",4751,4,"43,44,45,46",59,38,"3711, 3716, 3721, 3726, 3731, 866, 3736, 3741, 3746, 3751, 3756, 3761, 3766",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/new-mums/new-mums-your-body"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/new-mums/new-mums-your-body</a></p>",en,published
1831,New mums: the first weeks,"In the early weeks, rest whenever you can, and give yourself time to get to know your baby. It helps to know where and how to get support in the first weeks with your baby. A child and family health nurse will usually visit you at home. If you have breastfeeding problems, ask for advice. Many women experience mild depression a few days after giving birth. If the feeling of depression does not go away, seek help.","<h2>After the birth: what new mothers can expect</h2>

<p>If you had your baby in a hospital, you and your baby will <strong>probably stay in hospital for at least 24 hours</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are both well enough, you might be encouraged to go home earlier. If you want to go earlier or stay longer, or you are not sure, it is okay to talk with your doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Your hospital stay might be longer</strong> if you have a medical condition, your baby needs extra care or your labour or birth was assisted – for example, it was a forceps birth or caesarean birth. In these situations you might stay in hospital for 2-5 days.</p>

<p>If your baby was born prematurely, he will probably need to stay in hospital for longer in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or the special care nursery (SCN).</p>

<h2>Before you leave hospital</h2>

<p>It helps to know about your recovery and how to get support in your first weeks at home with your baby. Before you leave hospital you or your partner might like to ask:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>who to contact for breastfeeding support</li>
	<li>where to go for your six-week check-up</li>
	<li>whether you can drive or lift and carry heavy things</li>
	<li>when and where to have your stitches taken out (if you have them)</li>
	<li>whether the hospital has a lactation consultant or women’s health physiotherapist and how to contact these professionals.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also ask about <strong>caring for your new baby</strong>. For example, it is good to know things like:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>how many feeds your newborn might need and how long feeds might take</li>
	<li>how to recognise your baby’s cues for comfort and feeding</li>
	<li>who to call if you or your baby is sick</li>
	<li>how to contact your home visiting nurse and how the nurse can help you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your doctor will give you this information as part of your care.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to ask friends or family members for help with practical jobs like washing baby clothes, buying nappies and filling your fridge and pantry with healthy foods.</p>

<h2>Your feelings in the first week after birth</h2>

<p>Whether you have given birth at home or in hospital, your body has been through a lot. The good news is that you will start to heal, and you can usually manage pain and discomfort.</p>

<p>Most women will feel <strong>tired and overwhelmed</strong> soon after giving birth. You might also feel relief, happiness, fear and joy. You might feel teary and anxious 3-5 days after birth. </p>

<p>It can really help to keep talking to your partner about how you are feeling. This helps both of you to be aware of any changes in mood and how long the changes go on for.</p>

<p>You will probably start to feel like yourself again in a week or two. If the feelings of mild depression do not go away, it is important to seek help. For one in every seven women, these feelings become postnatal depression. When women get help early, they usually recover fully from postnatal depression.</p>

<h2>Home visits from a nurse</h2>

<p>A health nurse will usually visit you at home in the week after you leave the hospital. They will check on you and your baby, and answer your questions. Some new mothers also choose to see a private lactation consultant.</p>

<h2>Learning to breastfeed</h2>

<p>Breastfeeding can sometimes be tricky for new mothers, but finding a breastfeeding technique that works for you and your baby can make all the difference. It can help to have as much skin-to-skin contact as possible and to keep your baby close to you in the early hours and days.</p>

<p>It is normal for it to take several weeks to breastfeed confidently.</p>

<p>If you have any problems with breastfeeding, talk with your doctor or nurse. </p>

<h2>Learning about baby care</h2>

<p>If you are a <strong>first-time mother</strong>, there is a lot for you to learn about caring for your new baby. For example, you will probably need to learn about:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>breastfeeding</li>
	<li>changing disposable or cloth nappies</li>
	<li>bathing your baby</li>
	<li>finding a newborn routine</li>
	<li>safe sleeping for babies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Taking it easy</h2>

<p>Sometimes a good day will be just feeding and comforting your baby, getting out of your night clothes and having a shower. This is totally fine. Try to rest whenever you can, and give yourself time to get to know your baby.</p>

<p>It is also good to have someone you trust to support you for the first few days – for example, your partner, a family member or a friend. If you are not a first-time mother, it is still good to have support, especially if you have other children to look after.</p>

<h2>Eating and drinking</h2>

<p>Some days it can be hard to make time to cook a healthy meal, even though you know healthy eating and drinking is important. If friends and family offer to cook meals for you, accept them. You can also buy prepared meals, soups and salads for the days when time is short.</p>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p>Family and friends will be excited to see you and your baby. They will want to visit you at home.</p>

<p>It is okay for you to say how and when you would like visitors. For example, you can say no to visitors who are unwell. And it is important for your other children and close family members to be up to date with immunisations before meeting the baby.</p>

<p>Some new mums give the job of managing visitors to their partners or a trusted friend. For example, they might ask family and friends to come two at a time or to wait a few days before visiting.</p>

<p>It can help to put a ‘do not disturb’ sign on your front door, use voicemail and switch your mobile phone to silent.</p>

<p>Other parents can be a great source of help and support. If you join a local or online mothers group, you can share ideas and experiences with other new mothers.</p>",4006,4,43,59,60,"3711, 3716, 3721, 3726",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/new-mums/new-mums-first-weeks"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/new-mums/new-mums-first-weeks</a></p>",en,published
1836,"Healthy breastfeeding diet, exercise and lifestyle",A healthy breastfeeding diet includes a wide variety of foods from the five main food groups. It is also important to look after yourself by getting enough physical activity and avoiding certain foods and other substances.,"<ul>
</ul>

<h2>Breastfeeding diet: what your body needs</h2>

<p>Despite the fact that breastfeeding increases the need for energy and some nutrients, human milk is made from maternal nutrient stores, so well-nourished mothers need not worry that the quality of their breastmilk will suffer from an imperfect diet. Breastmilk remains perfect for the infant even in cases of hardship and famine. Only in rare cases when mothers experience long-term, severe nutritional deficiency is their breastmilk affected. An excuse to not choose breastfeeding based on the fact that a woman enjoys drinking coffee or tea, or an occasional alcoholic beverage, is unwarranted.</p>

<p>Unless a vitamin-mineral deficiency is identified, or the mother has a restricted diet, dietary supplements are not necessary. A diet including a variety of foods, adequate in calories, should provide the woman with all the nutrients she needs. Despite this fact, many clinicians recommend the continued use of a prenatal vitamin/ mineral supplement for the duration of lactation (AAP, 2012).</p>

<p>When you are breastfeeding, your body needs extra nutrients. That is because your body is working harder to make breastmilk full of nutrients for your baby. But you don’t need a lot of extra energy. So it is really important to eat a wide variety of foods every day from the five main food groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>vegetables – 7½ servings a day</li>
	<li>fruit – 2 servings a day</li>
	<li>grain foods – 9 servings a day</li>
	<li>protein – 2½ servings a day</li>
	<li>dairy or calcium-enriched products – 2½ servings a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are eating a healthy diet, you will be getting enough of most nutrients. But there are a few nutrients you need to be aware of – <strong>calcium, iodine, vitamin B12, Vitamin A and vitamin D</strong>. It is also important to make sure you are drinking enough healthy fluids and you use iodized salt.</p>

<p><strong>Calcium</strong><br />
Calcium makes up an important part of breastmilk and is very important for your baby’s bone development.</p>

<p>You get calcium from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>dairy products like milk, cheese and yoghurt</li>
	<li>calcium-enriched products like some brands of soy milk</li>
	<li>fish with edible bones, like sardines and salmon</li>
	<li>tofu</li>
	<li>some green leafy vegetables like spinach.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Iodine</strong><br />
Your baby depends on your breastmilk as a source of iodine, which keeps his brain and nervous system developing.</p>

<p>The best source of Iodine is Iodized salt, in small amounts Iodine is also found is some sea food and bread and foods made with Iodized salt.</p>

<p>Zinc. The requirements for zinc during lactation are greater than those during pregnancy. Breastmilk provides the only dietary source of zinc for exclusively breastfed infants, and it remains a potentially important source of zinc for children beyond infancy who continue to breastfeed. Zinc supplementation has not been found to affect concentrations in the breast- milk of women with normal zinc levels, but it may increase the zinc content of the milk of women with suboptimal zinc status (Sazawal et al, 2013).</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Vitamin B12</strong><br />
Your baby gets vitamin B12 from your breastmilk. Vitamin B12 is very important for your baby’s developing nervous system.</p>

<p>You get vitamin B12 from meat, fish, eggs, milk and fortified breakfast cereals.</p>

<p>If you follow a restricted diet, particularly a vegan diet, a vitamin B12 supplement is recommended strongly. The milk of a vegan mother can be severely deficient in vitamin B12, leading to a deficiency in her infant which, if not treated, hence the nursing mothers who follow a strict vegetarian diet should have their own and their infant’s B12 monitored.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br />
Your baby depends on your breastmilk as a source of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps your baby absorb calcium, which she needs for bone growth and development.</p>

<p>Your body makes most of the vitamin D you need when you get enough direct sunlight on your skin. There are small amounts in oily fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks and butter.</p>

<p>The AAP recommends that all breastfed infants receive 400 IU (10 mcg) of vitamin D as a daily supplement starting at birth, allowing him or her to easily achieve vitamin D sufficiency.</p>

<p>You might be at risk of vitamin D deficiency if you are dark-skinned, if you keep all of your skin covered or if you rarely go outdoors. If you are deficient, you and your baby might need to take a vitamin D supplement. Your doctor or a dietitian can help you work out what you need to do.</p>

<p><strong>Fluids</strong><br />
Your body needs slightly more water when you are breastfeeding. You should aim to have around <strong>nine glasses of fluids</strong> a day. But you might need more on hot or humid days or if you are very active.</p>

<p>If you are not sure whether you are getting enough fluids, have a look at your urine. It should be pale yellow. Dark yellow urine is a sign that you need to drink more fluids.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong> is the cheapest and healthiest drink. Avoid soft drinks, fruit juices, flavoured milk, flavoured water, sports drinks and energy drinks.</p>

<p>Some women worry about losing the weight they gained during the pregnancy. The best way to get back to a healthy weight after pregnancy is by breastfeeding, eating healthy food and doing gentle exercise. Crash or fad diets are not good ways to lose weight, because you will miss out on important nutrients.</p>

<h2>Foods to limit in a breastfeeding diet</h2>

<p><strong>Caffeine</strong><br />
Caffeine transfers into breastmilk, so avoid drinking large amounts of caffeinated drinks like tea and coffee. Newborns are especially sensitive to caffeine.</p>

<p>A moderate amount of caffeine is usually fine – about two cups of coffee or three cups of tea a day. You could also try things like non-caffeinated and herbal teas or decaffeinated coffee instead.</p>

<p>If your baby is restless or has difficulty sleeping, you could try limiting how much caffeine you have and see whether this helps.</p>

<p><strong>Processed snack foods and fast food</strong><br />
Keep these kinds of foods to a minimum. These foods are high in salt, saturated fat and sugar, and low in fibre and nutrients.</p>

<p>Excluding potential allergy-causing foods while you are breastfeeding will not reduce the risk of your baby developing allergies. In fact, avoiding too many foods can be dangerous, because your baby will not get important nutrients.</p>

<h2>Alcohol, smoking, medication and breastfeeding</h2>

<p>A lot of what you eat, drink or smoke is passed through your breastmilk to your baby and can affect your baby’s brain development.</p>

<p>If you are breastfeeding, it is best <strong>not to drink alcohol, smoke or use drugs.</strong></p>

<p>But if you plan to have an alcoholic <strong>drink</strong>, it is best to limit the amount to one drink. And wait 2-3 hours (per drink) before breastfeeding again.</p>

<p>It is best for you and your baby if you do not smoke.  But even if you do <strong>smoke</strong>, breastfeeding is still the best option for your baby. You can protect your baby by always smoking outside, and not smoking for an hour before feeding.</p>

<p>Smoke gets trapped on your hair, clothing and skin. So when you are smoking, cover your hair and clothes with something your baby will not come into contact with. And you should also wash your hands and brush your teeth after each time you smoke.</p>

<p>Make sure other people smoke well away from you and your baby too.</p>

<p>If you need to take <strong>drugs or medication</strong>, check with your doctor or pharmacist about what medications are safe while breastfeeding, and about the timing of medications around breastfeeds.</p>

<h2>Exercise and breastfeeding</h2>

<p>It is important to allow your body to recover after birth, but when you are ready, some <strong>regular exercise will boost your health and wellbeing</strong>.</p>

<p>Being active every day:</p>

<ul>
	<li>strengthens your bones</li>
	<li>reduces your risk of heart disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes</li>
	<li>controls your weight</li>
	<li>improves your sleep</li>
	<li>reduces your stress levels</li>
	<li>improves your mental wellbeing.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <strong>begin with gentle exercise</strong> like walking, and then try activities like<strong> swimming, yoga or Pilates. </strong></p>

<p>Moderate exercise <strong>will not affect your breastmilk</strong>, your supply, the amount of nutrients in your breastmilk or your baby’s growth.</p>

<p>Some women worry that exercising will lead to too much lactic acid in their breastmilk. But this happens only after exercising at a very high intensity, and extra lactic acid in your breastmilk will not harm your baby anyway.</p>

<p>Talk with your doctor or physiotherapist about the right exercise for you.</p>

<p>It can be hard to find the time to fit exercise in, but you can try making it part of everyday activities – for example, pushing your baby’s pram to the shops to pick up some things for dinner gets you out of the house and keeps you active too. You could learn a few exercises to do from home, or use exercise apps or YouTube videos.</p>",3591,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"2636, 2641, 2646, 2651, 2656, 2661, 2666, 2671, 146, 2676, 2681, 2686, 2691, 2696, 2701, 2706, 2711, 2716, 2721, 2726, 2731, 2736, 2741",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/new-mums/breastfeeding-diet-lifestyle"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/new-mums/breastfeeding-diet-lifestyle</a></p>",en,published

<p>Perinatalna depresija ima dve forme -  depresija koja se javlja tokom trudnoće i depresija koja se javlja posle rođenja. Obe su ozbiljne, negativne emocionalne promene koje traju duže od dve nedelje i sprečavaju vas da radite stvari koje želite ili želite da uradite u svom svakodnevnom životu.</p>

<p>Imaju iste simptome i leče se na isti način. Jedina razlika između njih je vreme javljanja. u svakom slučaju, obe forme depresija su više od emocionalnih promena koje biste mogli da očekujete tokom trudnoće i neposredno nakon rođenja deteta. Na primer, trudnice mogu da očekuju da se osećaju prilično emocionalno dok prolaze kroz velike fizičke i praktične promene za to vreme. A nove majke mogu očekivati da će doživeti blagu depresiju nekoliko dana nakon što rode dete.</p>

<p>Obe forme emocionalnih promena ne traju dugo. Možda ćete čuti antenatalnu i postnatalnu depresiju koja se zajedno naziva perinatalnom depresijom. Ako vi ili vaš partner osećate simptome depresije, potrebna vam je stručna pomoć i podrška porodice. Važno je da prepoznate znakove i simptome  depresije što je ranije moguće.</p>

<h2>Simptomi perinatalne depresije</h2>

<p>Perinatalna depresija može da varira od osobe do osobe.

<p><strong>Prijem u bolnicu </strong></p>

<p>Nije uobičajeno da se mlade majke primaju u bolnicu zbog perinatalne depresije. Zdravstveni radnici mogu razmotriti prijem žena u bolnicu u slučaju da žena ima jak nagon ka samoubistvu ili pomišlja da povrede sebe ili svoju bebu. Trebalo bi hitno da se obratite svom lekaru ili odeljenju hitne pomoći vaše lokalne bolnice. Lekari i osoblje bolnice mogu vam pružiti pomoć i podršku koja vam je potrebna.</p>

<h2>Praktične strategije pomoći </h2>

<p>Ako vi ili neko vaš blizak ima perinatalnu depresiju evo nekoliko strategija za pomoć</p>

<p><strong>Emotivna podrška</strong></p>

<p>Dobijanje emocionalne podrške od partnera, porodice i prijatelja važan je način da se nosite sa perinatalnom depresijom. Razgovor sa nekim ko može da razume kako se osećate može vam pomoći da upravljate nekim od simptoma. Roditeljska grupa, igraonica ili terapijska grupa mogu biti drugi izvor emocionalne podrške. Na ovim grupama možete upoznati druge ljude sa kojima ćete deliti svoja iskustva.</p>

<p><strong>Pomoć u kući</strong></p>

<p>Vaš partner, porodica i bliski prijatelji mogu vam pružiti praktičnu pomoć kod kuće. Dobro je zamoliti nekoga kome verujete da redovno dolazi i pomaže u kućnim poslovima ili nezi dece. Pomoć kod kuće pruža vam priliku da se odmorite, zaspite ili uradite nešto opuštajuće. Takođe je dobar izvor druženja, što je važno za vaš oporavak. Nema potrebe da se osećate krivima zbog traženja ove vrste pomoći. Mnogi vole da pomognu i biće im drago ako ih pitate da urade nešto konkretno.</p>

<p><strong>Briga o sebi</strong></p>

<p>Vaše emocionalno blagostanje i vaše fizičko zdravlje direktno su povezani.</p>

<p>U oba slučaja možete da uradite sledeće:</p>

<ul>
	<li>redovno vežbajte </li>
	<li>nađite dobar način da osmislite svoj dan</li>
	<li>dobro jedite - imajte neku jednostavnu hranu pri ruci, poput voća, jogurta, integralnog hleba i svežeg povrća isečenog pripravnog za jelo</li>
	<li>da biste što bolje upravljali stresom pokušajte da se odmorite - spavajte dok beba spava, idite rano u krevet i spavajte kad god možete.</li>

1846,Parenting teamwork: why it is important,"Being a parent can be great fun, with lots of opportunities for love and excitement. It also brings challenges and hard work. Parenting teamwork helps you face these challenges in a positive way that minimises conflict and strengthens relationships.","<h2>About parenting teamwork</h2>

<p>Teamwork is working together, agreeing<strong> on your approach to parenting</strong>, making decisions together and supporting each other.</p>

<p>It is about agreeing on things like children’s bedtimes, family nutrition or discipline. And it is also about you and your partner sharing the job of managing your house and family. This can include things like caring for your children, doing chores and paperwork, and earning an income.</p>

<h2>Why parenting teamwork is important for your children</h2>

<p>The way that you and your partner interact with each other has <strong>a big influence on your children</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, when parents see themselves as a team and work together, children feel safe and good about themselves. They also learn about respectful communication and how to build healthy relationships.</p>

<p>On the other hand, children who see and hear severe conflict between their parents are more likely to develop problems with behaviour and development.</p>

<h2>Why parenting teamwork is important for you</h2>

<p>When you work as a team with your partner, you are likely to feel <strong>happier, more confident and more satisfied with your parenting</strong> and your family life. It is also easier for you to enjoy the time you spend with your family.</p>

<p>And to be in the best position to work as part of a parenting team with your partner, you need to <strong>look after yourself and your relationship</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, staying healthy, managing stress and looking after yourself more generally can give you increased energy to support and respect your partner and children. It can also help you get the most out of being a parent.</p>

<p>It is also worth putting time into keeping your relationship with your partner healthy. Caring for children and juggling work, family and time for yourself does place demands on a relationship. But when you make ‘couple time’, you are likely to feel closer to your partner and more supported as a parent. And this can make parenting together more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Parenting teamwork skills</h2>

<p>Parenting teamwork gets easier with time and practice. But there are also some skills that help you and your partner work well as a team. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>problem-solving – this means finding new and creative solutions in situations where you are stuck or cannot work through your issues</li>
	<li>managing conflict – this means managing and resolving disagreements in a collaborative and positive way</li>
	<li>talking and listening – this means communicating in ways that help you connect and strengthen your relationship</li>
	<li>backing each other up – this means parenting in consistent and supportive ways</li>
	<li>accepting each other – this means living with and valuing each other’s differences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Parenting teamwork after separation</h2>

<p>Parenting teamwork can be even more important after separation, but it can sometimes be more challenging too. Co-parenting often means you have more things to keep track of. This might include things like visitation schedules and arrangements for attending parent-teacher interviews or medical appointments.</p>

<p>If there is conflict between you and your former partner, it is important to manage it in a positive, respectful and business-like way. Grown-up conflict management can teach your child valuable skills, but ongoing conflict between separated parents is not good for children.</p>

<p>If you are a single parent, you might sometimes feel like you are doing it all by yourself. But you do not have to. It helps to build a strong network of people who can support you. These people might include family, friends, colleagues and support groups.</p>

<h2>When parenting as a team is hard</h2>

<p>There might be times when you and your partner find it hard to work as a team. This is more likely to happen during times of change, like when a parent returns to work or a child begins school. The natural changes in life can make teamwork tricky because they affect family routines.</p>

<p>You might find you’re having trouble working through disagreements or conflicts, or you have thought about separation.It is good if you and your partner can get help together. See your doctor to talk things through and get a referral to a local relationships or family counselling service.</p>

<p>If your partner does not want to go to counselling with you, it is still worth seeking help, even if it is by yourself.</p>

<p>If you are in a relationship that involves family violence, call a helpline if there is one in your city/country, seek support and do whatever you need to do to ensure your safety and your children’s safety.</p>",4896,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2491, 516, 2496",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/parenting/parenting-teamwork"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/parenting/parenting-teamwork</a></p>",en,published
1851,Healthy relationships: parents and partners,Some of the experiences that come with being a new parent can make you feel even more deeply connected as a couple. But caring for babies and children can also put new strains on your relationship. Open communication can help you nurture healthy relationships.,"<h2>When you are parents: how relationships might change</h2>

<p>Most couples experience relationship changes when they become parents.</p>

<p>For many people the birth of a child brings positive changes in their relationship. For example, you and your partner might feel a new and different level of connection. But you might also experience some strains, even if these weren’t part of your relationship before becoming parents.</p>

<p>Less sleep, less time to talk, less time to spend together – these things can all take their toll on your relationship while you care for your new baby.</p>

<p>These changes and strains might mean you <strong>disagree more often</strong> or that things do not quite feel right. Also, you might not have the energy to sort out problems when they arise.</p>

<p><strong>Open communication</strong> helps keep things on track and helps you both come to terms with these changes. It can nurture and strengthen a healthy relationship with your partner, as well as with friends and relatives.</p>

<h2>Healthy relationships: tips for parents</h2>

<p><strong>Listen to each other</strong><br />
Good listening is the most important communication skill you have. It helps you and your partner feel heard, understood and supported.</p>

<p>That is because good listening helps you understand things from your partner’s point of view and puts you in touch with your partner’s feelings. If you want your partner to listen to you, you need to be prepared to hear issues from your partner’s point of view.</p>

<p>You can show you are really listening by <strong>stopping what you are doing</strong> when your partner wants to talk, and by paying full attention to your partner’s words and body language.</p>

<p>It is important to encourage your partner to talk by asking open-ended questions, like ‘What do you think about … ’. These questions can encourage more discussion about issues. You can also check whether you have understood by restating your partner’s comments in your own words.</p>

<p>And remember – if you are thinking about what to say next, you are not really listening. Instead, try to <strong>focus your attention</strong> on what your partner is saying. You can even jot down notes if you are concerned you will forget something important.</p>

<p><strong>Tell your partner how you feel</strong><br />
Your partner is not a mind reader! When you talk about your frustrations and fears, your happiness and joys, it  makes it easier for your partner to know what you are going through.</p>

<p><strong>‘I’ statements</strong> are easier to listen to than ‘you’ statements, which can seem like criticisms. So when you talk, you could say things like ‘I feel a bit lonely when we spend less time together’. This might be better than ‘You don’t make any time for us anymore’.</p>

<p>It can be hard to slot in discussions between nappy changes – you might find it helps to set aside time to talk.</p>

<p><strong>Accept the changes</strong><br />
You can look at your relationship as being in a new phase, rather than off track. It is good to talk about what the new phase means to you both and how you can manage it.</p>

<p>If you are finding that spending time together is more difficult in this new phase, try a new approach – for example, planning time for the two of you.</p>

<p><strong>Manage conflict</strong><br />
Differences in opinion will come up as you go through changes – talking about these can help you both understand each other’s perspective. It’s okay to disagree.</p>

<p>It can help to relieve tension if you accept different points of view while explaining your own. You can use the tips on listening, above, to find out what your partner means rather than counter-attacking, which can make things worse.</p>

<p>When you are making decisions together, aim for ones that are okay for both of you – especially decisions about parenting. As parents, it is important to be on the same page, but you might find that agreeing on things like routines, discipline and bedtimes takes some teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>Stay close now you are parents</strong><br />
Simple things like asking your partner about the day (‘What was good?’, ‘What wasn’t so good?’) can help you keep in touch.</p>

<p>Small gestures that show your partner that you care can also do the trick. This might be just a cup of tea or offering your partner a sleep-in when tiredness sets in.</p>

<p><strong>Make some ‘couple’ time </strong><br />
Making some time to spend together as a couple can give you both the opportunity to talk, reconnect, enjoy each other’s company and nurture your relationship.</p>

<p>When you are ready, you could:</p>

<ul>
	<li>organise a babysitter and go out somewhere you both enjoy during the day or in the evening – it could be for a meal, a walk or a movie</li>
	<li>make time to do something special together at home – for example, a special dinner or a movie after your children have gone to bed</li>
	<li>think about what you liked to do before you became parents and work out how you could make it happen again – even if you do it a bit differently now.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan ahead for these activities, they are more likely to happen. It also gives you something to look forward to.</p>

<h2>Having a sex life</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, most couples do get their sexual relationship back on track eventually. Putting more time into talking and spending time together can make you feel closer, and this helps your sex life.</p>

<p>If you are feeling too tired or too distracted to even think about sex, try talking to your partner about how you feel. Just like time together, sex might also need a bit of scheduling.</p>

<h2>Taking control of your relationship</h2>

<p>You can do this by talking honestly about the changes taking place in your lives. This might mean talking about how you feel about your new roles, and what you see these roles as being.</p>

<p>Having children often brings up issues from your own childhood. Discussing these together can help you both to understand how they might influence what you do and say as parents.</p>

<p>If things are getting tough, it might be worth seeking support. You could speak with your doctor or see a counsellor.</p>",3936,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"1671, 516, 2496",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/healthy-relationships-parents"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/healthy-relationships-parents</a></p>

1856,Sex and intimacy after a baby,"Birth and parenthood are likely to change the kind of sex you have and how often you have it. For women, interest in sex can return 1-3 months after having a baby, but it is normal for it to take longer. Unless your doctor has advised otherwise, you can have sex again when you feel ready. Talk together about how you are both feeling so you understand what is happening with your relationship.","<h2>Sex after baby: how your sexual relationship might change</h2>

<p>Sex and intimacy is often tough for new parents – less time, tiredness, hormonal changes and worries about contraception can make it tricky.</p>

<p>If you and your partner have both gone a bit cool on sex, it is no problem. But if you and your partner have different levels of sexual desire, this can add some stress to your relationship.</p>

<p>In most relationships, things do get back on track, but it is important to be patient. If you are concerned that your sex life is off track, talk with your doctor.</p>

<h2>Women: your sexual feelings after giving birth</h2>

<p>After giving birth, you might feel like you will never have sex again. But you will heal and <strong>your interest in sex will return</strong>. For many women, this happens within 1-3 months of your baby’s birth, but it is normal for it to take longer.</p>

<p>Some mothers find that they feel sensual and sexual when breastfeeding their baby. This is partly because of the hormone oxytocin, which is involved in milk let-down and also sexual arousal. It is completely normal.</p>

<p>It is also normal for breastfeeding mothers to find that they have less interest in sex when they are breastfeeding.</p>

<h2>When to have sex again after baby</h2>

<p>When to have sex again is mostly about when you feel ready (unless your doctor has advised otherwise).</p>

<p>If you have had a difficult birth or stitches, your body will need time to heal. Many new mothers feel pain or discomfort during sex, but this usually improves with time. Using a lubricant or oestrogen creams might make sex more comfortable. Sometimes discomfort can be because of muscle spasms or anxiety.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some new mothers and their partners find that sex is less satisfying because the muscles are too loose after being stretched during the birth. The muscles will gain tone again – pelvic floor exercises can help.</p>

<p><strong>Breastfeeding </strong>can cause vaginal dryness, but using a lubricant can help with this. And if you are breastfeeding, you might find that milk leaks from your breasts during sex. Try feeding your baby, or expressing, before having sex.</p>

<p>Your body after pregnancy and birth might not be the same shape as before. Parts of your body might have changed too, like your breasts, tummy or legs. These changes can affect how you feel about yourself, including how sexy you feel. If you are finding it hard to accept the changes, talk with your doctor, your nurse or a fitness instructor.</p>

<h2>Contraception after a baby</h2>

<p>As new parents, you might not be ready to have another baby yet, so it is a good idea to think about contraception before you start having sex again. Your doctor or nurse will usually talk with you about contraception at the six-week check-up for mother and baby. If you and your partner want to have sex before then, <strong>talk to your doctor about contraception</strong>.</p>

<p>Some mothers are fertile, or have started to ovulate, even before they have a period. This increases their chances of becoming pregnant if they have sex without using contraception.</p>

<p>You might have been told that <strong>breastfeeding</strong> makes it less likely that you will become pregnant. This can sometimes be the case if a new mother:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>is exclusively breastfeeding day and night</li>
	<li>is not giving her baby any other food or drink (just breastmilk)</li>
	<li>has a baby who is under six months old</li>
	<li>has not had a period since giving birth.</li>
</ul>

<p>But keep in mind that <strong>there is no guarantee</strong>. You might still get pregnant if you are having sex without using contraception.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to talk with your GP, child and family health nurse or family planning clinic about your contraception options. Some types of contraception are not suitable for breastfeeding mothers.</p>

<h2>Your feelings and your partner’s feelings about sex</h2>

<p>You might feel confused or worried if you are not interested in sex in the months following the birth of your baby. Your partner might feel rejected or unwanted.</p>

<p>These mixed and confusing feelings are not much fun, but they are <strong>normal</strong>. Lots of people go through them in the early days, months and years of raising a family – you are certainly not alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I feel like I’m just a sperm donor and I’ve outlived my usefulness.</em><br />
– New father<br />
<br />
<em>He just doesn’t understand that I’m not interested right now.</em><br />
– New mother</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Rebuilding intimacy: ideas</h2>

<p>There are other ways to stay connected with your partner. Talking and listening with your partner about your feelings will help to keep the lines of communication open and help you both understand what is happening in your relationship.</p>

<p>If one of you is home caring for the baby while the other works outside the home, check that you are both sharing the household work – or that you are comfortable with how <strong>domestic chores </strong>are being divided.</p>

<p><strong>Spending time together</strong> can be more of a challenge when you are new parents, but it is still important. You might be able to go for a walk or have dinner together. If you cannot find someone to look after your baby, take him for a walk in the pram while you talk, or have a meal together once he is asleep.</p>

<p><strong>There are many ways of giving and receiving sexual pleasure. </strong>Think about sex as the end point, rather than the beginning. Start with simple things like holding hands and cuddling. Physical affection can build and lead to sex when you are both ready.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When our son was about three months old, he would sleep for about an hour after lunch. If we were home together we would have a cuddle and a rest while he was having his nap. It was one way to make a little bit of time for each other.<br />
– New mother</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Looking after yourself</h2>

<p>Healthy eating and exercise plus rest and sleep are all ways to look after yourself. It is hard to be interested in sex if you are tired, sick or stressed. If your baby is waking at night, try to make some time to rest during the day.</p>

<p>It can also help to check the balance in your lives. With a young baby it is easy to get caught up in your child’s day-to-day care and forget about your needs. So making time – even if it is just 15 minutes – to do something for yourself each day helps.</p>

<p>It could be catching up with a friend, going for a walk or reading a book. It could be time when your baby is asleep, before she wakes in the morning or during your lunch break at work. Talk with other parents about how they find time for themselves.</p>

<p>If you and your partner are feeling low and have also lost interest in sex, this can be a sign of postnatal depression (PND). It is important to let your doctor or nurse know so you can get help. You can read more about PND in women and PND in men.</p>

<h2>Where to get help</h2>

<p>If you and your partner need help, talk with your health professionals. They might refer you to a therapist or couples counsellor.</p>

<p>Other parents can also be a great source of help and support. You could try talking to other new mothers and fathers in your parents group, if you’re in one.</p>",4891,4,"43,44,45,46",59,38,"3771, 3776",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/your-relationship/sex-intimacy-after-baby"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/your-relationship/sex-intimacy-after-baby</a></p>",en,published
1861,Parent communication: tips for talking with your partner,Talking keeps you and your partner close and can strengthen your long-term relationship. Constructive and positive communication and talking are also some of the best ways to sort out the conflicts that can come with raising children.,"<h2>Why talking is important for communication and relationships</h2>

<p>Talking together builds understanding. Talking with your partner about everyday things – like what you are doing and how you are both feeling – is one of the main ways that partners connect. It can also help you and your partner prevent and resolve problems or conflict.</p>

<p>This means it is important to talk together in positive ways. What you say and how you say it, including your body language, influence how your partner understands and responds to you.</p>

<p>Good communication is also about listening. With good listening skills, you can really understand what your partner is saying and help your partner feel heard and valued.</p>

<h2>Talking and communication: basic steps</h2>

<p>Constructive talking starts with some simple steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pick your moment.</li>
	<li>Be positive.</li>
	<li>Keep it brief.</li>
	<li>Take responsibility for your feelings.</li>
	<li>Avoid saying hurtful things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps 1: pick your moment</h2>

<p>When you want to talk to your partner, it is often best to do it <strong>when everyone is calm and has time to listen</strong>, or when your children are not around or are asleep.</p>

<p>If you need to talk about a difficult issue, you might need to wait until the issue is over, or make a time to talk later if you or your partner is very upset or angry.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to let little things go and save negotiations for issues that mean a lot to you. Ask yourself if an issue is really important before raising it with your partner.</p>

<h2>Step 2: be positive</h2>

<p>Everyone likes to feel appreciated, so <strong>look for opportunities to say positive things</strong> to your partner. For example, ‘I really appreciate the fact that you help with dinner and bath time each night’.</p>

<p>If your partner is used to getting praise and encouragement from you, your partner is more likely to listen when you have to raise a problem. And you can <strong>raise problems in a positive way</strong> too. For example, ‘It is great when you are here at dinner and bath time. I have really missed your help the last few nights’.</p>

<p>Communication will also be easier and more positive if you<strong> use open body language</strong>, which includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>sitting or standing in a relaxed way</li>
	<li>trying not to frown or look too serious</li>
	<li>making eye contact with your partner</li>
	<li>sitting or standing near each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might be surprised at how often the basics of politeness can slip in long-term relationships. Words like ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ can help a lot when you are talking to your partner!</p>

<h2>Step 3: keep it brief</h2>

<p>Long and wordy explanations can sound like a lecture. They can also be a barrier to your partner understanding you.</p>

<p>Instead, it can help to think about what is most important for your partner to hear, then try to describe it in as few words as possible. For example, ‘Ivan wants you to be at his music concert this weekend. It is on at the same time as your gym class. Do you think you can skip your class this week?’</p>

<p>Sometimes other issues and concerns will come up, but it is best to stay focused on the topic. For example, ‘I know you hardly get any time for yourself these days and we can talk about that later, but can we first decide if you can be at Ivan's concert?’</p>

<h2>Step 4: take responsibility for your feelings</h2>

<p>It is better to share your own feelings and thoughts about a situation – particularly vulnerable feelings like worry, doubt or sadness – instead of talking about what your partner is or isn’t doing.</p>

<p><strong>‘I statements’</strong> can help with this. For example, you could say, ‘You are always on your phone or laptop. And I have to get dinner ready and look after the children’. But <strong>it might be better to say</strong>, ‘I feel really stressed when I am rushing around to get dinner ready. I would find it easier if the children were occupied. Could you be available to help out around dinner time?’</p>

<p>Your partner is likely to feel more open and less defensive if you take this approach.</p>

<h2>Step 5: avoid saying hurtful things</h2>

<p>Some ways of talking are likely to hurt your partner’s feelings and make your partner less likely to listen to you. So try to avoid:</p>

<ul>
	<li>calling your partner names – for example, ‘You’re stupid’</li>
	<li>bringing up the past – for example, ‘This is just like last time’</li>
	<li>questioning your partner’s intentions or motivation – for example, ‘You just don’t care’</li>
	<li>making unhelpful comparisons – for example, ‘You’re just like your mother!’</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also best to avoid phrases that imply that someone is always wrong or not trying – for example, ‘You always ...’ and ‘You never ...’. These statements can make your partner defensive too.</p>

<p>Talking is not something you do only when you have a problem. If you set aside regular time to share thoughts and feelings and enjoy each other’s company, it is good for your communication and relationship overall. And it is good practice for talking when there is a problem.</p>

<h2>Getting help with talking and communication</h2>

<p>All relationships have their ups and downs. But if you are really upset at the end of most conversations with your partner or you feel that you do not ever get to share your feelings, it might help to speak to someone. You can talk to a trusted friend, family member, or your doctor. </p>

<p>Couple counselling can help. If your partner does not want to go it is still worth seeking help, even by yourself.</p>

<p>If you are in a relationship that involves family violence, call a helpline, seek support and do whatever you need to do to ensure your safety and your children’s safety.</p>",4886,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3781, 3786, 3791, 3796",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/communication-conflict/talking-with-your-partner"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/communication-conflict/talking-with-your-partner</a></p>",en,published
1866,Problem-solving steps for parents,Problem-solving is a way of finding new and creative solutions in situations where you are stuck or cannot work through your issues.,"<h2>Why problem-solving is important</h2>

<p>As parents, the way you manage any problems or disagreements in your relationship affects your children.</p>

<p>By managing problems positively and constructively, you can protect your children from the downsides of conflict. When you and your partner find solutions together, you help the whole family have happier, healthier and stronger relationships.</p>

<p>This is because a problem-solving approach can help you and your partner to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>confront issues, rather than avoiding them</li>
	<li>talk and listen respectfully and patiently</li>
	<li>find solutions that you are both happy with</li>
	<li>feel like you are working as a team.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach can also teach your children important skills for life.</p>

<h2>Ground rules for problem-solving</h2>

<p>Before you start problem-solving, it is a good idea to set some ground rules. It is also good for you and your partner to come up with the ground rules together.</p>

<p>Here are suggestions for <strong>problem-solving ground rules</strong> to get you started:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Either person can raise a problem for discussion at any time.</li>
	<li>Either person can say ‘no’ if they do not want to talk about it right then, but agree to make another time to discuss it – no more than a day after it first comes up.</li>
	<li>If the discussion gets heated, either person can call for a ‘break’ to calm down.</li>
	<li>Raise problems at a good time and place. For example, do it when the children are not around, when there is enough time to discuss the issue, when there are no other competing demands like making dinner, and when you are both calm.</li>
	<li>Try to listen so you both understand what the other person is saying.</li>
	<li>Agree that you will not raise conflict topics or show disrespect in front of other people.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind that if one of you has a problem, you both have a problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem-solving: how to do it</h2>

<p><strong>1. Define the problem</strong><br />
Be clear and specific about the problem:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Describe what is happening, how often it is happening, and who is involved. For example, ‘In the past three weeks, I feel like we have argued a lot more than usual’.</li>
	<li>Focus on the issue, not the person. For example, ‘We are always doing chores or taking the children to sport, and we have not been able to relax together. I think it is affecting our relationship’.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge your role or contribution to the problem. For example, ‘I know I started a few of those arguments’.</li>
	<li>Describe the problem with a neutral, non-blaming approach. To do this, you could try phrasing the issue as a question. For example, ‘Can we talk about how we can make some time for our relationship?’</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Clarify what you each want</strong><br />
Be clear about what is important to each of you. Ask questions to clarify your positions. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Why is that so important?</li>
	<li>Why do you want/need that?</li>
	<li>Why are you concerned/worried/afraid about that?</li>
	<li>Why don’t you want/need that?</li>
	<li>What would be so awful about that?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your goal is to have a clear understanding of what you both want. Be patient and focus on listening to each other’s answers.</p>

<p><strong>3. Brainstorm solutions</strong><br />
Write down any and all possible solutions. Here are some tips to get you started on brainstorming:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take turns to suggest ideas.</li>
	<li>Try to get as many ideas as you can, even if some do not seem relevant. Aim for at least 8-10 ideas.</li>
	<li>Include all ideas. Rejecting ideas can hurt each other’s feelings and stop you from sharing your ideas.</li>
	<li>Wait until you have got all your ideas down before you talk about them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Evaluate solutions and choose one</strong><br />
Look at each solution on your brainstorming list, and narrow it down to one practical option that can solve your problem. Here are some tips that might help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cross off ideas you both agree will not work.</li>
	<li>If one of you thinks an idea might work, leave it on the list.</li>
	<li>List the advantages and disadvantages for each idea you have left on the list. Look at the advantages first – try to find something positive about every idea.</li>
	<li>Keep discussions brief so you have enough time to discuss all ideas left on the list.</li>
	<li>Cross off any ideas that clearly have more disadvantages than advantages.</li>
	<li>Rate the remaining options from 1 (not very good) to 10 (very good).</li>
	<li>Choose a solution that you and your partner agree to try – it might not be your preferred solution but it should be one that you are comfortable with.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you cannot find a solution</strong>, repeat the brainstorming step and try to come up with different ideas.</p>

<p>If you need some new ideas, you could ask trusted friends or family. But first check with your partner if he or she is okay with this. Your partner might prefer to keep some conflict issues private.</p>

<p><strong>If this still does not work</strong>, you could both agree to trying your choice of solution this time and your partner’s choice next time.</p>

<p><strong>5. Try the solution</strong><br />
Make a commitment to the solution by agreeing on the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Who will do what, when and where?</li>
	<li>What will happen if we do not do the things we have agreed on?</li>
	<li>Do we need to keep track of how well our solution is working?</li>
	<li>When will we review how the solution is going?</li>
</ul>

<p>If your solution is related to your children, consider getting them involved in trying the solution, if it is appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Review</strong><br />
After a set time, look at your solution and talk about how it is going. You could ask questions like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Is the solution working?</li>
	<li>What has worked well? What has not worked?</li>
	<li>What could we do to make things work more smoothly?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the agreement works, you will both notice there is less conflict. If there is not, ask yourselves these questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Was the solution reasonable?</li>
	<li>Did we both give and take?</li>
	<li>Were rules and responsibilities clear to both of us?</li>
	<li>Were consequences for breaking the agreement used, and were they appropriate?</li>
	<li>Have other issues come up that we need to talk about before our solution will work?</li>
</ul>

<p>You might find that you need to start the problem-solving process again to find a better solution.</p>

<p>It is normal to <strong>have some ups and downs</strong> along the way – allow 1-2 weeks for things to work.</p>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>If trying to work on problems makes you or your partner very upset or angry, it might help to speak to a relationship counsellor. Relationship counsellors can help you identify what is causing conflict between you and come up with practical solutions.</p>

<p>It is good if you and your partner can see a counsellor together. But if your partner does not want to go it is still worth seeking help, even if it is by yourself.</p>

<p>If you are in a relationship that involves family violence, call a helpline, seek support and do whatever you need to do to ensure your safety and your children’s safety.</p>",4881,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2491, 3801, 3806, 3811",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/communication-conflict/problem-solving-for-parents"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/communication-conflict/problem-solving-for-parents</a></p>",en,published
1871,Conflict management for parents,"Conflict is a natural part of relationships between partners, especially as you face the challenges of parenting. When you work together on conflict management, you build happy, healthy relationships and teach your children important life skills.","<h2>What is conflict?</h2>

<p>Conflict can range from small disagreements between you and your partner to arguments to physical fights. Conflict can also be in the form of uncomfortable silence, anger and hostility.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can sort out conflict with your partner quickly. At other times, it can be hard to work out solutions.</p>

<p>Conflict happens in relationships – <strong>it is normal</strong>. The important thing is how you handle it.</p>

<h2>Why conflict management is important for families</h2>

<p>Constructive conflict management is good for you, your relationship and your children.</p>

<p><strong>Good for you and your relationship</strong><br />
When you and your partner talk through your differences and come up with solutions you can both live with, you are both likely to feel more positive, happy and supported. Your relationship is likely to be stronger too.</p>

<p><strong>Good for your children</strong><br />
Conflict is a part of life. When your children see you working together on conflict management, it helps them learn valuable life skills like how to negotiate and solve problems effectively. It can also be reassuring for your children to see you being optimistic about working out your differences.</p>

<p>And children are badly affected in the short and long term by frequent, ongoing, angry or violent conflict. By working on conflict management, you protect your children from the downsides of conflict.</p>

<h2>Conflict management tips</h2>

<p><strong>Keep it to yourselves</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid arguing in front of your children.</li>
	<li>Save heated discussions for behind closed doors.</li>
	<li>Make a time to discuss problems when the children are not with you – for example, after children’s bedtime, or when they are at school or visiting grandparents.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Let children see you sorting things out constructively</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Take turns talking and listening.</li>
	<li>Be polite and respectful.</li>
	<li>Try to understand your partner’s feelings or perspective. You do not have to agree, but you can try to understand where your partner is coming from.</li>
	<li>Share your feelings with your partner.</li>
	<li>Assume your partner wants to work things out as much as you do.</li>
	<li>Take a problem-solving approach, and brainstorm lots of solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Let your children know they are not the problem</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not feel you have to tell your children what the issue is. Some problems are for grown-up ears only.</li>
	<li>Tell your children that the argument or conflict between you and your partner is not about them and that the grown-ups are sorting it out.</li>
	<li>Let your children know that you are trying to find a solution to the problem.</li>
	<li>Encourage your partner to spend happy, positive time with your children.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Focus on positive relationships with your children</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Make time for enjoyable activities with your children.</li>
	<li>Give your children positive attention, including lots of praise and encouragement when they behave in ways that you like.</li>
	<li>Give your children cuddles and tell them you love them – be affectionate.</li>
	<li>Talk with your children about things that interest them and what they are doing and feeling.</li>
	<li>Whenever you can, stop what you are doing so you can help, listen or talk to your children.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in a relationship that involves family violence, call a helpline, seek support and do whatever you need to do to ensure your safety and your children’s safety.</p>

<h2>How children are affected by parental conflict</h2>

<p><strong>Conflict affects children badly when parents fight a lot and do not resolve their differences.</strong> And the more parents argue, the more it affects children. Severe and frequent conflict can lead to a higher risk of emotional, behaviour and social problems.</p>

<p>For example, younger children might respond to conflict by throwing tantrums or behaving in difficult ways. School-age children are more likely to be disobedient and might have problems at school. Older children might experience problems like depression, worries and low self-esteem or confidence.</p>

<p>Conflict can be particularly harmful if it involves abuse, threats or arguments about a child in front of the child. Physical violence between couples can be even more harmful for children. Children who grow up seeing physical violence are more likely to have personal and social problems as adults.</p>",4876,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3816, 3821",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/conflict-management-for-parents"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/conflict-management-for-parents</a></p>",en,published
1876,Anger and anger management for parents,"Everyone feels angry sometimes – anger is normal. But if you find yourself getting angry a lot or you have trouble controlling yourself when you are angry, it is good to have some anger management techniques ready to go.","<h2>Anger and parents: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Anger is a <strong>normal human emotion</strong>, and it is normal to feel angry when you are a parent. All parents feel angry at some stage.</p>

<p>Anger can be a <strong>good thing</strong> too. Sometimes it can give you the energy to get something done or to stand up for what you believe in. Feeling angry and managing your anger in positive and healthy ways can also give you the chance to set a good example for your children. For example, when you take a few deep breaths or walk away rather than exploding, you show your children how to behave.</p>

<p>But <strong>anger can be negative</strong>, especially if it happens a lot or it gets out of control. Losing your temper when you are angry can make problems worse and lead to conflict with others. When you do not give yourself time to calm down, you might say or do unhelpful things that cannot be taken back.</p>

<p>Being around a lot of conflict and yelling is frightening for children.</p>

<p>If you’re finding it hard to control yourself when you’re angry, it might help to talk to a health professional.</p>

<h2>Why parents feel angry sometimes</h2>

<p>As a parent, you’re probably <strong>balancing many different demands</strong> including work, family time, household chores, children’s activities and social activities. When you’re busy and tired, it’s easy to lose patience and feel angry when children don’t cooperate or things don’t go to plan.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might feel <strong>angry or frustrated with your partner</strong>, if you have one, when you don’t agree about parenting, discipline and who does what household chores. These sorts of disagreements can even lead to conflict, especially if you’re feeling undermined or unsupported.</p>

<p>Sometimes <strong>your child’s anger or frustration can make you feel angry</strong>. For example, if your child is angry and speaks rudely to you or won’t do as you ask, you might feel yourself getting angry too. You might find yourself attacking back in the moment and regretting it later.</p>

<p>And there are <strong>other factors</strong> that can make you more likely to feel angry – like illness, stress at work, financial difficulties, lack of sleep and not enough time for yourself. You might sometimes feel you’re being pushed to the limit.</p>

<p>For some people, parenting can also raise unresolved anger or other difficult <strong>emotions from their own childhood</strong>. If you experienced trauma, abuse or neglect as a child, you might be more likely to overreact in some situations or have trouble controlling yourself when you’re angry.</p>

<p>Newborns and babies have very weak neck muscles to support their large, heavy heads. Violently shaking a baby – or hitting, kicking or throwing a baby – can result in death, disability or serious injury.</p>

<h2>Recognising signs of anger</h2>

<p>It might feel as though you just explode with anger without warning, but your body actually gives you early signs of anger. When you can recognise these signs, you can also take steps to stop your anger getting out of control.</p>

<p>Early signs of anger include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>faster heart</li>
	<li>churning stomach</li>
	<li>agitation – that is, feeling tense or cranky</li>
	<li>faster breathing</li>
	<li>tensing shoulders</li>
	<li>clenching jaw and hands</li>
	<li>sweating.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Negative thinking</strong><br />
Negative thinking is very common when you are angry, but it can make your anger worse.</p>

<p>For example, you might have had a hard day at work and feel stressed. When you pick your children up from school, they start arguing in the back seat, which makes you feel frustrated as well as stressed. Once you get home, they refuse to take out their lunch boxes and put their bags away so you feel angry as well as frustrated.</p>

<p>Here are some negative thoughts that you might have in this situation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘No-one ever helps me – I have to do everything myself.’</li>
	<li>‘You children are so naughty.’</li>
	<li>‘If you behaved better, I wouldn’t feel so angry.’</li>
	<li>‘Why do you want to upset me?’</li>
</ul>

<p>If you notice thoughts like these, it is <strong>a sign that you need to stop and do something to calm down</strong> before you lose your temper and explode with anger.</p>

<h2>Simple anger management ideas</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1: identify your anger</strong><br />
The first step to managing your anger is to notice the early signs. It is really important to know and say that you are angry, even if it is just to yourself. For example, ‘This is making me angry’ or ‘I can feel myself getting angry here’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: try to calm down</strong><br />
Once you notice the early signs of anger, you can do a few things to start calming down. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Take a big breath and sigh. Try to slow your breathing.</li>
	<li>Do something that soothes you, like listening to some music, flicking through a magazine or just looking out the window.</li>
	<li>Go outside for a run or walk.</li>
	<li>Take a warm shower.</li>
	<li>Go somewhere quiet for a few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Signs that you are calming down include your heart rate slowing down and your muscles relaxing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: reflect on the situation</strong><br />
If you feel you have calmed down, it might be a good idea to reflect back on the situation, and think about what has just happened. This can help you learn from the experience, and handle similar situations better in the future. Ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘How important is this? Why was I so upset about it?’</li>
	<li>‘How do I want to sort out this situation?’</li>
	<li>‘Do I need to do something about this, or can I just let it go?’</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a great idea to tell your children or your partner how you are feeling and what you are doing about it. It shows them a better way to manage their anger too. For example, ‘I’m feeling angry. I need to go outside for a minute to calm down before we talk about this’.</p>

<h2>Setting a good example for your children</h2>

<p>Saying sorry for getting angry sends the message that anger is not okay. But it is okay to feel angry – it is just not okay to yell.</p>

<p>So it is better to <strong>say sorry for yelling or losing your temper</strong>. This shows your children that it is okay to feel angry sometimes. The important thing is to find healthy ways of handling anger.</p>

<p><strong>What to do when you do not manage anger well</strong><br />
There will always be times when you do not manage anger well and you yell or say things you regret. This is normal.</p>

<p>When this happens, it is a good idea to take a moment to work out what to say to your children or your partner. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘I’m sorry for losing my temper. Next time I’ll take myself away to calm down earlier.’</li>
	<li>‘I’m sorry I yelled. Can we talk about what just happened?’</li>
	<li>‘I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that, even though I was angry. I should have walked away and calmed down before we talked about it.’</li>
</ul>

<p>Emotions build up when you are tired and stressed. Looking after yourself can help you feel calmer and better able to solve problems with your children as well as your partner, family and friends.</p>",4956,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3826, 5096, 936",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/anger-management-for-parents"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/anger-management-for-parents</a></p>",en,published
1881,Dealing with anxiety: tips for parents,Nothing is more normal than worry about a new baby or about how you are going as a parent. But dealing with anxiety can help you enjoy your life as parent more.,"<h2>Dealing with anxiety: why it is important</h2>

<p>Anxiety and worry about parenting is normal.</p>

<p>The problem is when worry or anxiety becomes extreme. Then it can get in the way of your health and your daily life. It can even stop you from being the parent you want to be.</p>

<p>That is why dealing with anxiety is important.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of anxiety</h2>

<p>Some common symptoms of anxiety are:</p>

	<li>finding it hard not to worry</li>
	<li>feeling restless</li>
	<li>having trouble relaxing or sleeping</li>
	<li>having trouble concentrating</li>

<p>It is normal to have some of these symptoms from time to time. But if you are feeling a lot of these symptoms and it is making it hard for you to get on with your daily life, it might be time to find ways of dealing with anxiety.</p>

<h2>Dealing with anxiety: everyday tips</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things you can do <strong>if you have a situation or problem that is causing you anxiety</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give yourself time to calm down before you respond to the situation. For example, if your child comes out of school and tells you someone is being mean to her, you might feel worried. Instead of seeing the teacher straight away, it might be best to go home and talk with your child. If you are still worried the next day, make an appointment to see the teacher.</li>
	<li>Try to focus only on the situation and deal with other things later. For example, if you feel anxious because your child has a fever, just focus on helping your child feel better and making an appointment with the doctor. You can worry about things like the groceries or the washing later.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also take some <strong>simple steps to cope with anxiety more generally</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Talk to someone about how you are feeling – your partner, a family member or trusted friend.</li>
	<li>Join a local parents group or playgroup to connect with other parents who might be in a similar situation and can share advice from their own experiences.</li>
	<li>Keep a diary or journal to record your feelings. You might be able to see a pattern in the things that upset you.</li>
	<li>Try breathing for relaxation, muscle relaxation or mindfulness.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these everyday tips for dealing with anxiety don’t help, <strong>seeking professional help</strong> is important. Making an appointment with your doctor to talk about things is a great first step.</p>",4871,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3831, 3836, 3841, 3846, 3851, 3856, 3861, 3866, 3871, 3876",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/anxiety-tips-for-parents"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/anxiety-tips-for-parents</a></p>",en,published
1886,Stress and stress management: grown-ups,"Stress is a normal reaction to changes and challenges, like those that come with being a parent. Some stress can be healthy, but too much can be overwhelming. If stress is an issue for you, it is good to know some stress management techniques.","<h2>Stress: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Stress is a normal part of life, something that everybody experiences.</p>

<p>Some stress can be helpful, giving you the motivation and focus to face challenges and get things done.</p>

<p>But <strong>too much stress can be overwhelming</strong>, making it difficult to cope with everyday tasks. If you have too much stress, you might end up getting sick or not being able to look after your children and enjoy everyday family life.</p>

<h2>What causes stress?</h2>

<p>Changes in your life, even positive ones, can be stressful, especially if you think you cannot cope. For example, having a baby is a life-changing – and stressful – event for many people.</p>

<p>Feeling uncertain, not having control over your environment, and having too much to do and not enough time to do it are also big causes of stress. It is easy to see how a new baby might create this kind of stress in your life, or a toddler who has public tantrums. </p>

<p>And then there are the everyday issues – for example, getting yourself and the children out of the house and off to school and work on time.</p>

<h2>Signs that you might be stressed</h2>

<p>If you are stressed, your body will probably let you know. In a stressful moment, your heart rate might go up, your breathing might get faster, and your muscles might tense up.</p>

<p>Sometimes these short-term stress reactions  can actually help you deal with stressful situations. For example, they might give you the adrenaline rush you need to get to the bus on time.</p>

<p>But if you keep going at this speed, your body will get exhausted. You might end up with headaches, sleep problems, digestive problems or the feeling that you just cannot cope. This obviously is not good for your health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>So it is important to watch out for <strong>signs of stress</strong>. You might be stressed if you are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>worrying about absolutely everything</li>
	<li>drinking too much alcohol, smoking or using drugs</li>
	<li>finding it hard to be tolerant with your partner or children</li>
	<li>having trouble sleeping</li>
	<li>not feeling well – perhaps you have headaches or other aches and pains</li>
	<li>not wanting to get out of bed in the morning</li>
	<li>having thoughts like ‘I’m never going to get out of this mess’</li>
	<li>feeling that you are not managing practical everyday things, like family routines and finances.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simple stress management tips</h2>

<p><strong>Get to know what makes you stressed</strong><br />
If you know what your stress triggers are, it can be easier to deal with stress. You might be able to avoid stressful situations, or prepare yourself. A useful exercise is to write down what makes you feel stressed.</p>

<p>For example, your child crying for a long time might be very stressful for you. If it is important for you to be on time, you might find it stressful when you can see the clock ticking but your children are moving slowly. If you love a clean and tidy house but no longer have one, this could be stressful.</p>

<p><strong>Positive thinking and self-talk</strong><br />
Unhelpful thinking makes it harder to deal with stressful things – for example, in a stressful situation you might think, ‘What’s wrong with me? I am losing control ’ or ‘I’m a failure’.</p>

<p>But <strong>you can change unhelpful thinking</strong> into realistic helpful thinking and positive self-talk, which are good ways to deal with stress. They increase your positive feelings and therefore your ability to cope with stressful situations.</p>

<p>To <strong>put realistic thinking and self-talk into action</strong>, try the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Challenge unhelpful thoughts. For example, your child cries in the supermarket. You think, ‘Everyone will think I’m a bad parent’. But you could ask yourself, ‘How do I know that people will think this?’, ‘Would I think this about someone else?’.</li>
	<li>Be realistic. For example, it might be too much to expect your child never to cry in the supermarket. But perhaps you could change the situation so the crying is less likely to happen. Would your child cry less if you went shopping at a different time of day, perhaps after he has had a nap?</li>
	<li>Develop positive self-talk statements. For example, you could say to yourself, ‘The shopping will not take much longer – I can get through it’, ‘People are minding their own business – they’re not looking at us’, ‘Who cares what other people think?’.</li>
	<li>Know your limits. If you feel irritated or find an experience overwhelming it might be best to try to avoid the source of stress if possible. For example, try online shopping if supermarket shopping is too hard for you and your child.</li>
</ul>

<p>The more you practise positive self-talk, the more automatic it will become in your life. Start practising in one situation that causes you stress, and then move on to another one.</p>

<p><strong>Focus on what’s essential </strong><br />
Stress often means you are trying to do too much, so try setting realistic goals for your day. You could also avoid taking on more than you can handle.</p>

<p>Making a plan and having some family routines can help you feel more on top of things and take your stress down a notch or two.</p>

<p>And if you have some large tasks to deal with, they might be more manageable if you break them down into smaller chunks. You might also think about asking for some help from family or friends.</p>

<p><strong>Stay connected with others </strong><br />
Talking things over with your partner or a friend can help you keep things in perspective. If you find it hard to talk, you could try using a diary to record your thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>Spending some time with friends can be a real help too. Even meeting for a quick coffee can be enough, because sharing worries can help you feel supported and better able to cope.</p>

<p>If you have limited time, connecting with other parents through social media or even emailing friends can help you stay in touch with like-minded people.</p>

<p><strong>Make physical and emotional health a priority</strong><br />
Avoid stimulants like cigarettes and caffeine and depressants like alcohol if you can.</p>

<p>Look after your <strong>physical health</strong> by eating well, getting some exercise, and making time for rest. Sometimes a brisk walk around the block or a quick nap can change your mood.</p>

<p>If you find it hard to get to <strong>sleep</strong>, do not watch television, check your emails or use social media before going to bed. If you are lying awake at night, get out of bed and read something non-stimulating until you feel sleepy. You could also try doing some guided meditation to help you relax.  If stress or worry about a problem is keeping you up, it might be useful to write down your worries and look at them the next day.</p>

<p>If you are working long hours, think about whether there are ways you could cut down or make work more flexible.</p>

<p>It can be easy to forget <strong>time for yourself</strong>. Make a list of things that you enjoy, whether that is reading magazines, watching television, gardening, shopping and so on. Try to do one thing on the list every day, or every couple of days, and especially on the weekend. Having fun with your partner and family might also be on your list.</p>

<p>Part of making time for yourself might be learning to <strong>say no</strong>. If you find this hard, you could look into an assertiveness course. Assertiveness courses can help you with techniques to set boundaries and say no without feeling guilty. Search online to find local or online courses.</p>

<p>Humour does wonders to melt away stress. Seeing the funny side of things will make you feel much better.  Smiling and laughing is one of the best relaxation techniques, and enjoying yourself can really help your stress levels. Try talking with a friend who makes you laugh, or watching a funny TV show. Did you know that you cannot feel anxious while you are experiencing joy?</p>

<h2>If stress continues</h2>

<p>If you are still feeling very stressed every day, it might be helpful to talk to a health professional, such as your doctor. </p>

<p>Stress is often the result of trouble with time management or other problems. Working out what the issues are with a professional and looking at solutions can be a big help.</p>",4846,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3881, 3886",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/stress-grown-ups"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/looking-after-yourself/stress-grown-ups</a></p>",en,published
1891,Muscle relaxation techniques for stress relief,Getting your body to relax physically is a great way to feel calmer and less tense. Here is how you can use muscle relaxation techniques for stress relief.,"<h2>Stress relief through muscle relaxation</h2>

<p>Muscle relaxation techniques are a great way to feel calmer and more physically relaxed. <strong>Meditation, yoga, a hot bath or shower and even vigorous exercise</strong> can all help you with stress relief by relaxing both your body and mind.</p>

<h2>Basic muscle relaxation technique</h2>

<p>The following technique involves <strong>progressive muscle relaxation</strong>. You tense and relax each part of your body, one by one. It is an easy way to get started with muscle relaxation for stress relief.</p>

<p><strong>Getting ready to relax</strong><br />
Choose a time of the day when you are confident that you will not be interrupted – for example, when your baby is having a nap or after your children have gone to bed in the evening. Allow about 20 minutes for this exercise.</p>

<p>Find a place in the house that is quiet and away from everyone else.</p>

<p>Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothes and that you are neither too warm nor too cold. Take off your shoes if possible.</p>

<p>When you are ready, sit or lie down with your eyes closed. If you sit, you might want to sit in a comfortable chair or on the floor against the wall.</p>

<p><strong>Basic steps </strong><br />
Start by noticing where in your body you feel tense or tight. You can do this by mentally scanning your body from top to bottom to identify these areas. This will help you to become aware of how your body is feeling.</p>

<p>Next, start tensing individual parts of your body. As you tense each part, hold it for 5 seconds, then allow 10 seconds when you relax. Slowly breathe in when tensing muscles and slowly breathe out when relaxing them.</p>

<p><strong>Arms</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Start with your right hand – clench it into a fist and then relax.</li>
	<li>Tense your right bicep and then relax it by dropping your arm to your side.</li>
	<li>Do the same for your left hand and bicep.</li>
	<li>Lift your shoulders up as high as they can comfortably go and then relax them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Head</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Lean your head back so that you are looking at the ceiling. Relax by moving your head back to its normal position. Do not tense your neck if you have any neck problems.</li>
	<li>Open your mouth as wide as possible and relax.</li>
	<li>Poke your tongue out as far as you can and relax.</li>
	<li>Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth as hard as is comfortable for you and then relax.</li>
	<li>Clench your teeth and notice how your cheeks and jaw are becoming tense and then relax.</li>
	<li>Close your eyes as tightly as you can and then relax.</li>
	<li>Raise your eyebrows as high as you can and relax.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Legs</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Tense your bottom tightly and relax.</li>
	<li>Tighten your right thigh muscle and relax.</li>
	<li>Tighten your right calf muscle by pointing your foot down and relax.</li>
	<li>Do the same with your left thigh and calf.</li>
	<li>Tighten your toes if you are lying down, or dig them into the carpet or floor if you are sitting and then relax.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whole body</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Take a deep breath. When you feel that your lungs are full, take in a little more breath. Hold the breath for five seconds and then slowly breathe out.</li>
	<li>When your whole body feels relaxed, continue to breathe gently in and out.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have got only a few minutes, try this relaxation exercise on just your arms, shoulders and face. You will be surprised at how well it works.</p>

<h2>Making muscle relaxation work for you</h2>

<p>While you are doing this relaxation exercise, it might help to <strong>imagine yourself in a quiet, serene setting</strong>. You could picture yourself in your favourite place, like the garden, or imagine you are in a forest, by a river or on the ocean. Keep imagining yourself in this place for a while.</p>

<p>As you are doing the exercise, make sure to look after your body – do not tense a body part if you are worried that you might hurt yourself.</p>

<p>This muscle relaxation technique can be very useful <strong>if you have not been sleeping well</strong>. In this case, do it just before you go to bed. In fact, you might feel very tired after this exercise.</p>

<p>You can get more detailed exercises on the internet and YouTube.</p>",3261,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3891, 3896, 3901",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/anger-anxiety-stress/muscle-relaxation-techniques"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/anger-anxiety-stress/muscle-relaxation-techniques</a></p>",en,published
1896,Relaxation techniques: breathing exercises,"Need to relax, calm down or manage your emotions? Sometimes it is as simple as relaxing your breathing. Learning how to do breathing exercises is useful because many relaxation techniques include breathing exercises.","<h2>Breathing and relaxation</h2>

<p>If you are feeling stressed or anxious, you might notice that you are doing shallow breathing (or chest breathing) – that is small, short breaths. If you are breathing more deeply, you will notice that your abdomen rises and falls. This is more relaxing.</p>

<p>There are many different breathing exercises that you can use for relaxation. Here are some breathing exercises that you can do anywhere, anytime that you feel like you need to calm down.</p>

<h2>Basic breathing exercise</h2>

<p>This breathing exercise aims to get you <strong>breathing more deeply</strong> and feeling more relaxed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sit, stand or lie down so that you are comfortable.</li>
	<li>Close your eyes.</li>
	<li>Count to five as you slowly breathe in through your nose.</li>
	<li>When you feel that your lungs are full, hold the breath while counting to five. If you can hold your breath a few seconds longer, try to do so. This is often the hardest part of the breathing exercise to start with.</li>
	<li>Now slowly breathe out through your mouth, again counting to five.</li>
	<li>Repeat this exercise another two times (three times in total).</li>
	<li>Return to your normal breathing pattern. If you still feel tense or anxious, do the exercise again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think – five, five, five. As you do each part of this breathing exercise, count to five in your head. Count as quickly or slowly as you need to. When you first begin this exercise, you might be counting quickly, but with practice you will be able to slow down your counting.</p>

<h2>Breathing exercise to release muscle tension</h2>

<p>With this breathing and relaxation technique, you <strong>start by closing your eyes</strong>.</p>

<p>While you breathe in and out slowly and deeply, scan your body from top to bottom. Check for any tension or discomfort. You will probably notice that you are feeling tension somewhere – perhaps in your neck, chest, legs or shoulders.</p>

<p>Now visualise breathing slowly into the areas of your body where you have noticed tension or discomfort. Think of it as a warm, healing breath.</p>

<h2>Breathing and stretching exercise</h2>

<p>Here’s a <strong>10-second breathing exercise</strong> that combines breathing and stretching:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stand up straight. As you breathe in through your nose, raise your arms up over your head and touch your palms together.</li>
	<li>As you release the breath through your mouth, turn the palms of your hands outwards.</li>
	<li>Slowly bring your arms down while stretching out your hands and fingers at the same time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Deep breathing exercises are not recommended if your stress levels put you at risk of hyperventilation (as in a ‘panic attack’). Speak to your doctor if you are concerned.</p>",4821,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3891, 3896, 3901, 781, 3906, 3911",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/anger-anxiety-stress/breathing-exercises"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/anger-anxiety-stress/breathing-exercises</a></p>",en,published
1901,Mindfulness,"Mindfulness is paying attention to what is happening right now, moment by moment. Mindfulness can boost emotional and physical wellbeing, and help with stress, anxiety and depression. Mindfulness can help children handle the stress of study, work and play as they get older.","<h2>Mindfulness: the basics</h2>

<p>Our minds are constantly active. You might be watching television – but also thinking about the past, or worrying about something, or wondering what you are going to have for dinner.</p>

<p>Mindfulness is about <strong>stilling your active mind</strong>. It has been defined in several ways, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>giving your complete attention to the present on a moment-by-moment basis</li>
	<li>paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, without judgment.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is about <strong>being more aware as you live and experience each moment</strong> – as the moment happens. It can be a useful way of calming yourself, focusing and concentrating on what you are doing.</p>

<p>You can be mindful of your internal world – for example, sensations, breath and emotions. Or you can focus on what is around you – for example, sights, sounds and smells.</p>

<p>You can be mindful anywhere and with anything. For example, you can be mindful while you are eating, walking, listening to music or sitting.</p>

<h2>Everyday mindfulness</h2>

<p>You can use everyday moments to build and practise mindfulness. The more you practise, the more benefit you will get.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>encourage your child to build mindfulness</strong>. In many ways, this is just about getting your child to do what she naturally does. Young children are naturally mindful because every new experience is fresh and exciting for them. </p>

<p>Encouraging your child to be in the here and now can give him <strong>skills to deal with the stress of study, work and play</strong> as he gets older.</p>

<p>There are many <strong>ways to help your child build and practise mindfulness</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Colouring in is a great way to get your child focused on a task.</li>
	<li>Walking through nature with the family can get your child interested in exploring the beauty of nature. Your child could collect and examine autumn leaves, or she could feel the sand beneath her toes during a walk on the beach.</li>
	<li>Taking photographs or drawing something interesting or beautiful – like a sea shell or an insect – encourages your child to look closely at details.</li>
	<li>Looking after a vegetable patch encourages your child to notice how plants grow.</li>
	<li>Listening to music and focusing on the instruments or lyrics is a great way for your child to focus on the present without distraction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mindfulness meditation</h2>

<p><strong>Mindfulness meditation</strong> is a highly focused type of mindfulness. It combines meditation, breathing techniques and paying attention to the present moment to help you notice the way you think, feel and act.</p>

<p>You can do mindfulness meditation with an instructor, or you can use a guided mindfulness meditation app or CD.</p>

<p>If you or your child is interested in mindfulness meditation, it is important to not focus on negative or upsetting thoughts while you do it. If you think this could be an issue for you, an experienced counsellor can help you understand how you think and help you focus on positive thoughts.</p>

<h2>Mindfulness: the evidence</h2>

<p>There is clear evidence that practising mindfulness can have health benefits for adults.</p>

<p>For example, studies suggest that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) can reduce stress and improve other mental health issues. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) can help people with depression stay well and stop them from getting depressed again. It can work just as well as an antidepressant.</p>

<p>Being ‘present’ and less anxious can boost social skills and academic performance. It can also help people manage emotions.</p>

<p>There is not as much research into mindfulness with children and teenagers yet, so we do not know how well it works with them. But there is <strong>growing evidence that mindfulness helps with learning, decision-making, emotional intelligence, self-confidence and connectedness</strong> to others.</p>",4796,4,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,3916,,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/looking-after-yourself/anger-anxiety-stress/mindfulness</p>,en,published
1906,Work-life balance: tips for your family,"It is worth thinking about the balance between your work and the other important things in your life, especially your children and family. A good work-life balance is good for your children and good for you too.","<h2>What is work-life balance?</h2>

<p>Work-life balance is the relationship between your work and the other important things in your life, like your family, sport and social life, household chores, volunteer commitments and so on. If you feel like you have enough time for all of these things in your life, you probably have a good work-life balance.</p>

<p>There is no universal formula for work-life balance. It is different for everyone, because every family situation is different and unique. And it is also likely to change as your work, family and other responsibilities change.</p>

<p>With realistic expectations, and some trial and error, you are likely to find an approach that helps you and your family achieve work-life balance in the long term.</p>

<h2>Work-life balance: why it is good</h2>

<p><strong>Good for you</strong><br />
Finding a work-life balance means you are likely to feel:</p>

<ul>
	<li>less stressed and tired</li>
	<li>more in control of your time</li>
	<li>better able to make decisions and meet commitments</li>
	<li>more healthy.</li>
</ul>

<p>And a well-balanced family life can actually help prevent burnout at work too.</p>

<p><strong>Good for children</strong><br />
To develop and learn, children need warm, loving attention and quality time with you. Quality time is when you are physically and emotionally present with your child. A work-life balance can help you make this time for your child.</p>

<p><strong>Good for your relationships</strong><br />
Quality time spent together is the building block of all relationships, so a good work-life balance gives you the time and energy to develop better relationships with your child and your partner.</p>

<h2>How work and family life can get out of balance</h2>

<p>Work can get in the way of spending enough time – and enough quality time – with your child.</p>

<p>The time you spend working is obviously time you are not spending with your children. Working long hours might mean that you get home after your children are in bed, or that you leave before they wake up. You might hardly see them during the week. And if you bring work home, this can affect how much time you have with your children too.</p>

<p>Work can also have a negative effect on the time you spend with your children. You might be at home, but your mind can really still be at work. You might be thinking about something that happened during the day, or still focusing on a problem, for example.</p>

<h2>Why children need you to switch off from work each day</h2>

<p>Children often need your attention most at the end of the day, just when it can be really hard for you to give it. They might want to tell you all the news of the day or ask for your help with something.</p>

<p>And children can have bad days too, perhaps at child care or school. They might need your sympathy or advice, or they might just want you to listen while they get something ‘off their chest’. Younger children are often tired, grumpy or hungry by the time you are all home. They might just need cuddles.</p>

<p>It can be a difficult juggle when you are preparing dinner and getting ready for the next day. But it can be worth taking the time to <strong>stop, listen and connect with your child</strong>. It reassures children that they are loved, safe and secure – and it might help you all relax and feel better.</p>

<p>When you are busy, stressed or stretched to the limit, you can easily slip into thinking that paying attention to your child is just another job or responsibility. Instead, it might help to think how wonderful it is to have a child to come home to and share the world with.</p>

<h2>New work arrangements for better work-life balance</h2>

<p>When you are a working parent, you might like to consider family-friendly work arrangements. Try to find out what family-friendly policies your employer has in place by looking at your workplace agreement or talking to your workmates. Then talk to your boss about it.</p>

<p>Options might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>working flexible hours – for example, you might be able to arrive late and work late or vice versa, which can make school drop-offs or family dinners easier</li>
	<li>working from home</li>
	<li>working fewer hours – for example, by working part time or job-sharing.</li>
</ul>

<p>It does not matter what your friends do or what other people think you should do – choose the option that is best for your family.</p>

<h2>Changing work habits</h2>

<p>When you have children, it might help to <strong>rethink your work habits to make it all fit</strong>. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review the work day in your mind before you leave work. This can help you shift gradually to thinking about home and family.</li>
	<li>If your family and care arrangements allow it, consider staying a little longer at work to finish up a task instead of taking it home. Longer hours might not be the best option in the long term, though.</li>
	<li>Try to arrange your work so you take on the most challenging tasks at the beginning of the day, instead of at the end.</li>
	<li>Take a moment in your work day to feel connected with your child. This could be as simple as looking at a photo or thinking about a special thing you have done together recently. This can help you remember the reason you are trying to achieve a work-life balance.</li>
	<li>Try to set some boundaries around how much work you will do at home, including limits on checking and responding to emails or phone calls.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making the daily switch from work to home</h2>

<p>You might feel more ready to connect with your children when you get home if you can <strong>‘put work to rest’ </strong>in your head between work and home. Try some of these ideas on the way home:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Turn off your work phone and tune out by listening to music, the radio or a podcast, reading or exercising – try walking or riding a bike home if you can.</li>
	<li>Think about ways to make travel time more relaxing. For example, join a car pool, use public transport or walk if your situation allows it.</li>
	<li>Switch your thoughts to your child as you go from work to home.</li>
	<li>Do a simple mindfulness exercise, perhaps before you leave work or in your parked car.</li>
</ul>

<p>And <strong>settling in for the evening</strong> might be easier with these ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Have a ritual or routine to mark the physical, mental and emotional move from work to home, from worker to parent. It can be something as simple as changing out of your work clothes.</li>

1911,Returning to work after a baby: 15 tips,"When you return to work after becoming a parent, there is a lot to think about, including how you will fit in extra responsibilities. These tips can help you get the most out of your time at home and at work.","<h2>Your return to work: how to make it go smoothly</h2>

<p><strong>1. Make changes before you return to work</strong><br />
One way to do this is to think about what your new daily routine will be like and whether there are things you can start doing now to ease the transition – for example, trialling a new child care routine or finding a back-up carer.</p>

<p><strong>2. Plan your child care well ahead of time</strong><br />
Choose the type of child care that you think will be right for your family, and then plan how you will settle your child into care.</p>

<p><strong>3. Talk with family, friends, other carers and educators about your plans</strong><br />
It can help to get advice from other people. Professionals, or people who know you well, might have ideas for saving time or might be able to help you spot potential problems before they arise.</p>

<p><strong>4. Plan some food and cooking shortcuts</strong><br />
You could try cooking more than you need and freezing leftovers for future meals. Cooking websites often have quick and easy family recipes.</p>

<p><strong>5. Try to leave work distractions at work</strong><br />
Now that you have less time with your child, you will want to make the most of the time you do have together. For example, it can help to set some boundaries around how much work you will do at home, including limits on checking and responding to emails or phone calls.</p>

<p><strong>6. Do what you can the night before</strong><br />
Things like laying out clothes or making lunches the night before all make the morning less of a rush.</p>

<p><strong>7. Stick to a routine if you can</strong><br />
Family routines help children know what to expect and help them behave better too. Routines can also help you keep family life organised, which might reduce any stress you are feeling.</p>

<p><strong>8. Take your child or family to social occasions at your work</strong><br />
This can be fun for you and your child. And meeting your child might make it easier for your colleagues to be understanding – for example, if you have to take parental leave because your child is sick.</p>

<p><strong>9. Stay briefly with your child at child care, if you can</strong><br />
Spending a few minutes together at the start of the session will help ease your child into the new routine and environment.</p>

<p><strong>10. Build a relationship with your child’s carer</strong><br />
This can really cut down on your stress and your child’s stress. It also helps you keep up with what your child is doing and learning. You could let your child’s carers know how much you appreciate their care. You could also keep a photo of carers in your home, as well as a photo of yourself in the care environment to help your child connect the two settings.</p>

<p><strong>11. Tackle any questions or worries about your child’s care quickly</strong><br />
If you are worrying about child care, it can be hard to concentrate at work. And talking to your child’s carer regularly – not just when you have concerns – is another way to build a relationship and make it easier to tackle any worries that do come up.</p>

<p><strong>12. Have a back-up carer for your child</strong><br />
This will really reduce pressure and worry for you. Somebody who can help out at short notice and who you trust is the key. Some options are friends, parents from playgroup, grandparents, other relatives and partners.</p>

<p><strong>13. Have a back-up plan for when your child gets sick</strong><br />
It is pretty common for children to get sick in their early years at child care, so it is a good idea to decide what you will do when this happens. For example, if you have a partner, can one of you change your hours or work from home for a day or so to care for your child? Or you might need to find somebody else who can help out with emergencies.</p>

<p><strong>14. Plan some family time</strong><br />
This can be a real help if you find your work responsibilities are making it harder for your family to spend time together. For example, you could plan to go for a walk with your partner and child a couple of evenings each week.</p>

<p><strong>15. Take time to relax and unwind when you can</strong><br />
This will help your stress levels and overall wellbeing. If you can, taking public transport to work can be a great way to have some time to yourself to read or listen to music. During your lunch break, take a walk around the park, do some window shopping, go to the gym, have coffee with a friend or read a book – whatever it takes to have some time with yourself.</p>",4776,4,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3961, 3966, 3971",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/work-child-care/going-back-to-work/returning-to-work-tips"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/work-child-care/going-back-to-work/returning-to-work-tips</a></p>",en,published

1921,Building relationships with early childhood educators and carers,"Building good parent-educator relationships is one of the best ways to support your child’s early learning at child care. You can build relationships by communicating regularly with your child’s educators – for example, greeting them each day. A good relationship makes it easier to raise difficult issues when you need to.","<h2>Strong relationships with early childhood educators and carers: benefits</h2>

<p>When you have strong and respectful relationships with early childhood educators and carers at child care, there are lots of benefits for you and your child.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits for your child</strong><br />
To start with, strong relationships put you in a great position to give educators the information they need to help your child get the most out of child care.</p>

<p>Strong relationships are also <strong>good for your child’s social and emotional development</strong>. If you have positive and respectful relationships with educators, it gives your child a great ‘model’ of how to be and behave with other people. And if your child sees kind and respectful relationships, he will learn to act this way in his relationships with others.</p>

<p>Finally, building good relationships with educators is a way of showing interest in this part of your child’s life. And when you show interest, <strong>it helps your child feel valued</strong> and important.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits for you</strong><br />
The benefits of strong relationships with educators at child care include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>feeling that the educator is interested and understands when you talk about your child</li>
	<li>feeling comfortable to raise concerns and work out solutions with educators</li>
	<li>knowing what is going on at the child care service</li>
	<li>being able to influence programs and feel that your opinion is valued.</li>
</ul>

<p>Letting your child see that you trust her educators is a great way of helping her settle in to child care. You could keep a photo of educators on the fridge at home, as well as a photo of yourself in the care environment to help your child connect the two settings.</p>

<h2>Getting started on strong relationships with early childhood educators and carers</h2>

<p>You can start building relationships with early childhood educators and carers before your child starts child care and also in the early days of care.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to help you get started:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Find out how the service is run. This will help you know what to expect and understand your educator’s perspective.</li>
	<li>Spend time in your child’s group and be a part of what is going on.</li>
	<li>Let educators know what you like about the centre.</li>
	<li>Ask educators how you can prepare your child for child care. Are there tasks your child needs to be able to do or rules she needs to be aware of and follow?</li>
	<li>Give educators some tips on how to care for your child. For example, ‘Ina eats best with a spoon’ or ‘Yuri loves his tummy tickled when I do a nappy change’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communicating with early childhood educators and carers</h2>

<p>Once your child starts child care, communication with early childhood educators and carers is key to strong relationships.</p>

<p>This can be as simple as introducing yourself to educators and saying hello and goodbye at drop-offs and pick-ups. Over time you will all learn and remember each other’s names.</p>

<p>This lays the groundwork for talking to educators about your child and her interests, likes, dislikes and special needs. When your educators get to know your child like this, they can better support her learning and development and give her quality care. They are also in a better position to let you know when your child has a really good or bad day at care.</p>

<p>You will not always be able to talk to educators face to face, but you might be able to phone, email or write notes instead.</p>

<p>And remember that educators are like everybody else – they will feel good if you tell them they are doing a good job!</p>

<p><strong>Things that educators want to know about your child</strong><br />
Your child’s carers and educators will want to know about:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>things your child is interested in so they can make learning engaging for your child</li>
	<li>things that make your child happy, sad, worried or afraid so they can support your child</li>
	<li>times when one of your child’s parents is away so they can reassure your child</li>
	<li>times when there are big changes in your family – a new baby, a death, a separation or divorce – so they can help your child adjust.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most families go through hard times at some stage. If you are having trouble at home, consider asking the staff at your child’s program for information or referral to someone who can help.</p>

<h2>When there are problems at child care</h2>

<p>Sometimes there might be problems you want to discuss with your child’s early childhood educators and carers – for example, problems with lost items or your child’s toilet training. If you already have a positive relationship with educators, these issues will be easier to raise and quicker to sort out.</p>

<p>Many problems will be easy to sort with a note, email or a phone call but some might be more serious. If a problem will nor go away or is more complicated, you might need to work on the problem with your child’s educator.</p>",4951,4,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"3976, 3981, 3986, 3991, 3996, 4001, 4006, 4011",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/loving-relationships/building-relationships-with-carers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/loving-relationships/building-relationships-with-carers</a></p>",en,published
1926,Starting child care: getting ready,"Give your child care service information about your child’s sleep, preferred learning and social activities, allergies and so on. Prepare yourself and your child by spending some time at the service in the days and weeks before you start. Get organised the night before starting child care. This will help the first day go smoothly.","<h2>Starting child care: why it is good to prepare for the transition</h2>

<p>In the weeks and days before your child starts child care, it is good to get your child and family ready for the transition.</p>

<p>You can use this time to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make sure your child care service has all the information it needs to care for your child well</li>
	<li>prepare yourself and your child for the change, both practically and emotionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before your child starts care: information to give early childhood educators and carers</h2>

<p>Think about what early childhood educators and carers need to know about your child, and let them know before your child starts. This is likely to include information about:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>your child’s wellbeing, including sleep patterns, emotional and social preferences, and any unusual family events that might affect her</li>
	<li>food allergies, intolerances or other medical conditions</li>
	<li>any help your child needs with toileting</li>
	<li>learning activities your child enjoys</li>
	<li>any concerns you have about your child’s development</li>
	<li>specific family circumstances that might affect your child’s care – for example, custody arrangements</li>
	<li>your child’s immunisation status.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In the weeks before starting child care: emotional and practical preparation</h2>

<p>It is a good idea to start preparing for child care several weeks before your child’s first day.</p>

<p>For example, if possible you and your child could make short visits to the child care service to <strong>get to know the setting</strong> <strong>and its early childhood educators and carers</strong>. Try to stay for about an hour each time and visit at different times of day. You might be able to meet some other parents and talk to them about their experiences.</p>

<p>You can also start getting your child used to the <strong>child care daily routine</strong>. Ask the service about its daily schedule and make this part of your child’s routine at home, if your child is an appropriate age to do this. Child care settings should follow babies’ personal routines. But for older children, it can be a good idea to introduce the setting’s lunch, play and nap times at home. Your child might take less time to adjust to the routine when care starts.</p>

<p>In the weeks before starting, you can find out who <strong>your child’s main educator</strong> will be. If you can get a photo of this educator and talk about the person by name, this person will be more familiar to your child.</p>

<p><strong>Reading or telling stories</strong> about starting child care or making new friends can be a safe way for your child to explore strong emotions and understand new events. It is good to include all the feelings your child might go through – for example, happiness, enjoyment, friendship, sadness, anxiety, apprehension and tiredness.</p>

<p>And talking positively with your child about the new environment, friends, educators and activities will help both you and your child feel positive too.</p>

<h2>The night before starting child care: practical tips</h2>

<p>If you get practical things organised the night before, it can save you from a last-minute rush in the morning. This can help take the stress out of the first few days and weeks at child care.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for the night before starting child care:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Try to ensure your child eats a healthy dinner.</li>
	<li>Get your child into bed in enough time for a good night’s sleep. If your child does not sleep well, this might affect his experience the next day, so let your child’s carers/educators know.</li>
	<li>Check that all items your child is taking to child care are labelled with your child’s name.</li>
	<li>Pack all the things your child needs, including bottles, formula, nappies, hat, spare clothes, medicines and medical record.</li>
	<li>Pack special comfort items if the setting allows them – like cuddly toys, blankets or books, or a family picture.</li>
	<li>Pack food if the child care service does not provide meals.</li>
	<li>Wait until the morning to pack any food or drink that needs refrigeration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you need to pack food for your child to take to child care? Transport meat, dairy products or breastmilk from home in an insulated cooler bag with ice. This should keep the temperature of the food below 5°C. At the service, the food or breastmilk should go straight into a fridge.</p>",4946,4,"49,50,51,52",59,60,"3976, 3981",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/work-child-care/planning-starting-child-care/starting-child-care"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/work-child-care/planning-starting-child-care/starting-child-care</a></p>",en,published
1931,Starting child care: feelings,Many children have separation anxiety and fear of strangers when starting child care. These are normal parts of child development. You might feel strong emotions like excitement or anxiety when your child starts care. Be positive around your child and share your worries with friends and families if you need to.,"<p><strong>Your child’s feelings about child care: separation anxiety and fear of strangers</strong></p>

<p>Many babies and children are happy and comfortable about starting child care.</p>

<p>But many babies and children have some <strong>less positive responses</strong> too:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Separation anxiety: this is when children get upset when you leave them. Separation anxiety peaks around 14-18 months, although older children can experience it too.</li>
	<li>Fear of strangers: this is when children get upset around other people. It usually peaks at around 7-10 months of age.</li>
</ul>

<p>Separation anxiety and fear of strangers are <strong>normal parts of child development</strong>, and many babies and children go through these feelings to some extent. This is the same whether children go to child care or not.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that the time in child development when separation anxiety and fear of strangers happen is often the time when parents are thinking about going back to work and starting child care.</p>

<p>So if your baby or child is starting child care and experiencing separation anxiety and fear of strangers, <strong>it is not your fault</strong> – it is just how babies develop.</p>

<p><strong>Separation anxiety and fear of strangers at child care: what you can do</strong></p>

<p>Try not to worry. Children usually adjust as the new faces in their care setting become familiar. It just might take some children a little longer than others.</p>

<p>You can help your child overcome anxieties by spending time together in the new child care setting when you are getting ready to start child care.</p>

<p>It is also good to spend some time with your child before you leave him alone. In the early weeks of child care, if possible try leaving your child for just short periods, and building up to a whole day.</p>

<p><strong>How children feel about starting child care: other factors</strong></p>

<p>There are a few other things that affect the way your child might feel about and respond to starting child care:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Trusting, caring relationship with educators and carers:</strong> these relationships help your child respond well to child care.</li>
	<li><strong>The child care setting: </strong>if the setting is like other places your child is familiar with, your child might feel more comfortable.</li>
	<li><strong>Your child’s experiences of being cared for outside your immediate family</strong>: these experiences give your child practice in building relationships and help her learn that you will always come back.</li>
	<li><strong>Your child’s temperament:</strong> this affects the way your child responds to change, including a new child care setting.</li>
	<li><strong>Your child’s personal preferences:</strong> for example, your child might feel more comfortable if the setting’s routines are a good fit for the way he likes to be fed, comforted and soothed.</li>
	<li><strong>Your child's age and stage of development:</strong> for example, babies younger than six months are often happy to be left with educators because they have not yet developed separation anxiety or fear of strangers.</li>
	<li><strong>The number of days your child is in care:</strong> children attending fewer days a week have less time to get familiar with and comfortable in their new setting.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p>If you think your child really is not settling in at child care it is important to share information and ideas with educators.</p>

<p><strong>Your feelings about starting child care</strong></p>

<p>Starting child care is a big change. It can be an exciting and emotional time for families – for both children and parents.</p>

<p>Even if you have mixed feelings about the changes in your family life, it’s important for you to <strong>be positive about child care with your child</strong>. Children have an amazing ability to pick up on when their parents are worried or anxious, so try not to share worries or anxious feelings with your child. If your child senses that you like the service and trust the educators, he will be more likely to feel these things too.</p>

<p>This does not mean you cannot show your feelings, though. You might like to share them with your partner, a friend or a family member who can give you some support during this emotional time.</p>",4921,4,"49,50,51,52,57",59,60,"3976, 3981, 4016, 4021",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/work-child-care/planning-starting-child-care/child-care-feelings"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/work-child-care/planning-starting-child-care/child-care-feelings</a></p>",en,published
1936,Settling in at child care: tips for the early weeks,Try to ease your child into the new child care routine. Make time to stay with your child for the first few mornings. Make sure your child has enough attention and time for rest and quiet play at home. A good relationship with early childhood educators can help children to settle in.,"<h2>The first few weeks at child care</h2>

<p>Child care is a whole new environment for your child, with new people and new routines. If you can, it is good to start slowly. Find out if you could start with short days at the child care service.</p>

<p>It is also important to be aware of how your child is coping with the change once he starts. Your child has probably settled in well if he:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is generally happy to go to his child care setting</li>
	<li>shows you things he has made or done at child care</li>
	<li>talks happily about his day.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any concerns about how your child is settling in at child care, it is best to start by talking to her early childhood educators and carers.</p>

<p>The practical and emotional transition to child care might be smoother for you and your child if you start getting ready for child care well ahead of time.</p>

<h2>Settling in at child care: tips</h2>

<p><strong>1. Get organised early</strong><br />
Taking care of practical things like lunches and clothes labels the night before (or earlier) will reduce the stress of leaving the house in the morning. This means you can focus on your child and how he is feeling on child care mornings.</p>

<p><strong>2. Allow plenty of down time at home</strong><br />
Child care is very stimulating. Your child will probably be tired and need recovery time at home. This might mean an earlier bedtime or longer naps. Or maybe just quiet play in a familiar environment.</p>

<p><strong>3. Make special time at home with you</strong><br />
Now that you have less time with your child, you will want to make the most of the time you do have together.</p>

<p>If your child is still breastfeeding, breastfeeding her before and after child care can be a good way to connect. You might also be able to build special time into your evening routine, with songs and play at bath time, or cuddles and stories at bedtime. Or plan for relaxed family time together on the weekends – for example, a regular play at the park.</p>

<p><strong>4. Make time to stay with your child the first few mornings</strong><br />
Try staying with your child for five minutes for the first few days. You could read a book together or watch your child do activities. As you and your child become more comfortable at child care, you might take your child in and leave more quickly.</p>

<p><strong>5. Say goodbye</strong><br />
When it is time to go, let your child know you are going and when you will be back. Give your child a hug and a kiss, say goodbye to your child’s early childhood educator and leave.</p>

<p><strong>6. Build a relationship with your child’s early childhood educators and carers</strong><br />
Your child is more likely to feel secure in the new child care setting if she sees that you have a good relationship with early childhood educators and carers. If your child can see you trust the educator, she’s more likely to trust the educator too.</p>

<p><strong>7. Plan for breastfeeding</strong><br />
If your child is still breastfeeding, and if it is possible for you, you might want to think about visiting the centre during the day to give your child a feed. Many centres encourage breastfeeding mothers to visit, and it might help your child settle into care.</p>

<p>Some children do not want to leave child care. This is completely normal. It does not mean they like the early childhood educators more than their families. It just shows that they feel safe in the care environment.</p>

<h2>Settling a child with additional needs into child care: tips</h2>

<p>More and more kindergartens are being encouraged to include children with special or additional needs.  There can be some extra practical and emotional challenges to settling in children with additional needs.</p>

<p>If you have a child with additional needs, these ideas might help your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tell the carers and educators about your child’s additional needs when you fill out the waiting list form. If you get a diagnosis after you have done the paperwork, let the setting know when it offers your child a place.</li>
	<li>Make time to talk with staff so they can prepare for your child – for example, by getting specialist equipment or training staff.</li>
	<li>Spend time with your child’s new early childhood educators and your child in the setting, so you can show the educators how to look after your child’s additional needs. You might need to support the educator to learn new skills.</li>

1941,Child care: when your child is not settling,Some children take longer or need more help to settle into child care. Share information with your child’s educators about your child’s feelings and experiences at child care. Work with the educators to help your child build a trusting relationship with them.,"<h2>About settling in at child care</h2>

<p>Some children settle happily in their new child care setting within a few days or weeks. Others get upset and cry, even after the first few weeks. And some children settle at first and then get upset later – often when the novelty of the new environment has worn off.</p>

<p>It might help to know that most children stop crying shortly after the parent goes. And most children settle eventually.</p>

<p>Separation anxiety is a normal part of child development. The difficulty is that it often starts about the time that families are starting child care. It will pass in its own time, and your child’s educators will probably have plenty of ideas for supporting your child.</p>

<h2>Sharing information: a key way to help children who are not settling at child care</h2>

<p>Sharing information with your child’s educators and carers is really important to helping your child settle into child care.</p>

<p>For example, you could say, ‘Natasha doesn’t like a blanket during nap time’. Or you could tell them about things you do at home, like a special song you sing when you change a nappy.</p>

<p>It is also a good idea to<strong> share what is going on at home</strong> and how your child is feeling. For example, your child might be excited about a birthday, or sad and not sleeping well because her mother is away.</p>

<p>A <strong>chat with educators</strong> at the beginning and end of each day gives you the chance to find out how your child is settling. It also helps you build relationships with your child’s educators.</p>

<p>You can check with the child care setting if it is okay for you to call during the day to ask how your child has settled. This can really help your peace of mind. Most care settings welcome these calls.</p>

<h2>Building your child’s relationships with educators</h2>

<p>Children feel safe with people they know well and trust. So one of the best things you can do is <strong>help your child build trusting relationships with her educators</strong>. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show your child that you trust the educators – for example, let him see you talking comfortably with them.</li>
	<li>Talk to your child about the educators in the same way you talk about friends of your family. Say positive things and use the educators’ names.</li>
	<li>Display photos of the educators at home and give them photos of yourself so they can talk about you with your child. Or you could put photos in a book for your child. This helps your child make a connection between home and child care.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Saying goodbye: tips to help children who are not settling at child care</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas you can try to make it easier for you and your child to say goodbye at child care:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Acknowledge your child’s feelings, give her words to help express herself, and comfort her. For example, ‘I know you feel sad. It’s hard to say goodbye. But Tanya has got some pretty leaves to show you’.</li>
	<li>Talk about an activity you and your child will do together when you get home or when you come to pick him up, like playing in the garden or reading a story.</li>
	<li>Have a goodbye routine, like three kisses and a big hug or some other special thing that is meaningful to your child.</li>
	<li>Let your child know that you or another familiar grown-up will be back to pick her up at a particular time, or after an event that your child understands, like sleep or snack time.</li>
	<li>Keep your goodbyes brief. Staying around to comfort your upset child can sometimes make things worse. But it is a good idea to make sure the educator is nearby to comfort your child when you go.</li>
	<li>Try to stay positive, both when you say goodbye and at home. Otherwise your child might pick up on your anxious feelings and feel more worried or unsafe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Always say goodbye, even if your child looks busy and happy when it is time for you to leave. Leaving without a goodbye can make children more upset when they realise you have gone. It is best to let your child know you are going and say that you will be back later.</p>

<p>If you find that your child is not settling in and that the care setting just is not right for your child, you may wish to explore other child care settings that may suit him better.</p>

If you’re multilingual, you use more than two.Raising multilingual or bilingual children has many benefits. It can create strong family and cultural bonds, and it has potential academic benefits as well.  Yet raising multilingual or bilingual children may have challenges in time and effort.","<h2>Benefits of raising multilingual and bilingual children</h2>

<p>Raising multilingual or bilingual children is good not only for your children, but also for your family and your community.</p>

<p><strong>Children: benefits of multilingualism and bilingualism</strong><br />
For children, speaking more than one language is often linked to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>better academic results – this is because multilingual or bilingual children can often concentrate better, are better at solving problems, understand language structures better, and are better at multitasking</li>
	<li>more diverse and interesting career opportunities later in life.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if your children grow up speaking more than one language, they might have <strong>a better sense of self-worth, identity and belonging</strong>. This comes from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>feeling good about their heritage</li>
	<li>feeling confident about communicating and connecting with extended family members and people speaking other languages</li>
	<li>being able to enjoy music, movies, literature and so on in more than one language.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Families: benefits of multilingualism and bilingualism</strong><br />
For your family, developing your home language with your children may:</p>

<ul>
	<li>improve communication among your family members</li>
	<li>enhance emotional bonds</li>
	<li>make it easier for you and your children to be part of your culture</li>
	<li>boost your family’s sense of cultural identity and belonging.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communities: benefits of multilingualism and bilingualism</strong><br />
For your wider community, when children speak more than one language, it means that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>everyone in the community gets a better appreciation of different languages and cultures</li>
	<li>children can more easily travel and work in different countries and cultures when they grow up</li>
	<li>children understand and appreciate different cultures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible challenges of raising multilingual and bilingual children</h2>

<p>Raising multilingual or bilingual children does have its challenges, including handling <strong>pressure to speak only the majority language</strong>. This pressure sometimes comes from other family members, who may want the family to speak only the majority language at home.  It will help if you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make sure your children get lots of chances to hear and use their second and other languages</li>
	<li>talk to your children’s teachers and get their support for your efforts</li>
	<li>get support for yourself – for example, by talking to friends and family who are raising multilingual or bilingual children and finding resources in your community, like bilingual playgroups.</li>

1956,Raising multilingual and bilingual children: Recommendations and options,"The best way to help young children learn broad vocabularies in languages other than the ""majority language"" is to consistently use the ""home language"" or ""heritage language"" with them in the early years.  However, some families use two languages at home; either way, you can support your child’s multilingual or bilingual development through play, community activities and everyday activities at home.","<h2>About raising multilingual or bilingual children</h2>

<p>If you and your partner speak languages other than your country's majority language, you might want your children to grow up learning these languages. Raising multilingual or bilingual children has many benefits. For example, it can improve communication and bonds in your immediate and extended family.</p>

<p>The best way to help your children learn broad vocabularies in languages other than English is to always use those languages with them, especially in the early years.</p>

<h2>Raising multilingual or bilingual children: your family’s options</h2>

<p>The decisions you and your partner make about helping your children learn to use your languages depend on your family situation.</p>

<p><strong>Heritage language as home language for young children</strong><br />
Most often, you and your partner speak the same ""heritage language."" If so, for young children it's best to use that at home, especially if you are most comfortable in that language.  This option gives young children a strong foundation that then can easily be transferred to the country's majority language later on.  Most likely others in your family--aunts and uncles, grandparents, etc.--use that language also, making a close language community.</p>

<p>As children enter school, they will more often use the country's majority language (language of instruction).  They may be less willing to speak to you in your heritage language then.   However, it will be good to keep using that language as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Raising multilingual or bilingual children: tips</h2>

<p>Here are some practical tips for supporting your child’s multilingual or bilingual development.</p>

<p><strong>Play and games</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Read and tell stories in your language, and encourage your child to join in. Use dress-ups and be creative!</li>
	<li>Play games in your language, especially games that focus on language, like ‘I spy’ or simple card games.</li>
	<li>Sing songs, dance and play music in your language. Children love music, and melody is a great way to help them remember words.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Community activities</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Look for schools, child care centres or multilingual and bilingual programs that support your child’s use of your home language.</li>
	<li>Organise playtime with other children who speak the same heritage language.</li>
	<li>Organise visits to or from speakers of your language--extended family members, members of the local community.</li>
	<li>If possible, go to the library and borrow CDs, DVDs, picture books, in your language.</li>
	<li>Look out for cultural activities that you and your child can do together to tap into your family’s cultural heritage and identity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other activities at home</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Listen to radio or television programs in your language, including popular music programs.</li>
	<li>If you have family and friends who live in your country of origin, if possible you could encourage your children to connect with them using a video-messaging app or online.</li>
	<li>Try incorporating your language into your child's interests. For example, if your child loves different foods you could find your child’s favourite recipe or a typical recipe from your community and cook it together using only your language.</li>

1961,Why play is important,"Play is key to your child’s learning, development, confidence and well-being.Unstructured, free play is the best type of play for young children.  There are many ways you can encourage playful learning at every age.","<h2>The importance of play</h2>

<p>Play is so important in your child’s learning and development. When your child plays, it gives her lots of different ways and times to learn and grow.</p>

<p>Play also helps your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>build confidence</li>
	<li>feel loved, happy and safe</li>
	<li>develop social skills, language and communication</li>
	<li>learn about caring for others and the environment</li>
	<li>develop physical skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child will love playing with you, but sometimes she might prefer to play by herself. She might just want you to give her ideas and let her know how her play and games are going. And sometimes she might want to play with other children.  Watch your child and follow her lead!</p>

<h2>Different types of play</h2>

<p><strong>Unstructured, free play</strong> is the best type of play for young children.</p>

<p>This is play that just happens, depending on what takes your child’s interest at the time. Free play isn’t planned and lets your child use his imagination and move at his own pace.</p>

<p>Examples of unstructured play might be:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>creative play alone or with others, including artistic or musical games</li>
	<li>imaginative games – for example, making cubby houses with boxes or blankets, dressing up or playing make-believe</li>
	<li>exploring new or favourite play spaces like cupboards, backyards and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can support your child’s unstructured play by making play materials available (these do not have to cost anything!).  Sometimes all you’ll need to do is point your child the jumble of toys on the floor, or to the table with crayons and paper. Sometimes you might make a few suggestions--for example, ‘How about we play pretend animals? What do you want to pretend to be today?’</p>

<p><strong>Structured play</strong> is different. It’s more organised and happens at a fixed time or in a set space. It’s often led by a grown-up or is part of fun family times, especially if the whole family is staying at home together.</p>

<p>Examples of structured play include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>family board games or card games</li>
	<li>a home project such as painting on a big piece of paper together</li>
	<li>backyard fun with balls or an obstacle course</li>
	<li>storytelling groups for toddlers and preschoolers at the local library</li>
	<li>dance, music or drama classes for children of all ages</li>
</ul>

<h2>How play develops with your child</h2>

<p>As your child grows, <strong>the way he plays will change.</strong>   Here are ideas for each age from babies through preschool. </p>

<h2>Babies and toddlers: play ideas to encourage development</h2>

<p>For babies, the best toy is you. Just looking at your face and hearing your voice is play for your new baby, especially if you’re smiling.</p>

<p>You might like to try the following play ideas and activities with your little one:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Music, songs, gentle tapping on your baby’s tummy while you sing, or bells: these activities develop hearing and movement.</li>
	<li>Peekaboo: this is great for your baby’s social and emotional development.</li>
	<li>Gentle tickles, or objects with different textures, like feathers, mud, metal or foam: these develop the sense of touch.</li>
	<li>Objects of different sizes, colours and shapes: these can encourage your child to reach and grasp.</li>
	<li>Sturdy furniture, balls, toys or boxes: these can get your child crawling, standing and walking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regular tummy time and floor play are very important. Tummy time helps your baby develop muscle strength and control. It also lets your baby see and experience the world from a different perspective.Toddlers: play ideas to encourage development</p>

<p>Here are some ideas your toddler might enjoy:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Big and light things like cardboard boxes, buckets or blow-up balls can encourage your child to run, build, push or drag.</li>
	<li>Chalk, rope, music or containers can encourage jumping, kicking, stomping, stepping and running.</li>
	<li>Hoops, boxes, or pillows are good for climbing on, balancing, twisting, swaying or rolling.</li>
	<li>Dress-up games with scarves, hats and so on are good for imagination and creativity.</li>
	<li>If you have outdoor space, hills, tunnels, or cozy nooks can encourage physical activities like crawling and exploring.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you put on some favourite music while your toddler plays, she can also experiment with <strong>different sounds and rhythms</strong>. You might also like to sing, dance and clap along to music with your child.</p>

<h2>Preschoolers: play ideas to encourage development</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas to get your preschooler’s mind and body going:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Old milk containers, wooden spoons, empty pot plant containers, sticks, scrunched-up paper, plastic buckets, saucepans and old clothes are great for imaginative, unstructured play. </li>
	<li>Simple jigsaw puzzles and matching games help improve your child’s memory and concentration.</li>
	<li>Crayons, scissors, paper, paste or glue, old magazines or advertising flyers--all of these encourage imagination and creativity.  </li>
	<li>Home-made playdough or clay help your child develop fine motor skills.</li>
	<li>Favourite music or pots and pans are great for a dance concert or to make up music.</li>
	<li>Balls can encourage kicking, throwing or rolling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your child doesn’t want to play</h2>

<p>There might be times when your child doesn’t want to play – for example, he could be tired or bored by doing the same activity for too long, or he could be reacting to stress at home or in your community. This is  usually nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>However, consider speaking with a health professional or your child’s educator if:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>your baby </strong>avoids interactive play like peekaboo;</li>
	<li><strong>your toddler </strong>has interest in only one toy or only does one thing with a toy – for example, is only interested in spinning the wheels of a toy car, over and over, instead of driving it around the room like other children the same age;</li>
	<li><strong>your preschooler </strong>has no interest in playing with other children, or is never interested in playing pretend games.  But keep in mind that some children are shy or slow to warm up, and children have different play interests. </li>

1966,Letting your child lead play: activities for children 0-6 years,Following your child’s lead is good because your child learns most when he’s interested in play.You don’t need any special equipment for child-led play.Child-led play starts with noticing what your child is interested in and then going along with it.,"<h2>Child-led play: why it’s good for babies and children</h2>

<p>Child-led play means following your child’s lead in play. It means watching your child and responding to what she says or does to keep her attention focused a little bit longer.</p>

<p>Following your child’s lead is good because your child learns best when he’s interested in an activity. When you follow your child’s lead in play, you can take advantage of things that interest him to help him learn something new through play.</p>

<p>Also, when your child leads, she builds communication skills and learns how she can influence things around her.</p>

<h2>What you need for child-led play</h2>

<p>You don’t need any equipment for child-led play.</p>

<p>All you do is <strong>follow whatever your child is interested in</strong> at the time. This might be a toy or something in the environment, like a bird or a fire truck. It might even be you, and the funny faces and sounds you’re making together. </p>

<h2>How to follow your child’s lead in play</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Start by noticing what your child is interested in. It could be something he’s playing with, like a ball, or something he’s doing, like jumping through puddles.  Older preschool children begin to have longer-lasting interests--for example, dinosaurs, or fire engines, or cats, or music--all sorts of things!</li>
	<li>Ask your child if you can join in.</li>
	<li>Go along with what your child is doing. If she rolls a ball to you, you might roll it back. Stay focused on the activity. Avoid distracting your child or changing the way the activity is happening.   If your child is building a castle with blocks, because she really loves castles now, you might watch and start building along with her, or handing her blocks.</li>
	<li>Ask questions or comment on what you’re both doing – for example, ‘That was a big roll – I nearly missed it!’ or 'This is a big castle; who should live in it, do you think?' Give your child time to respond.</li>
	<li>If your child changes to something new, let him be the leader. For example, if he stops rolling the ball and starts playing with blocks, move to the blocks with him.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting child-led play for babies and younger children</h2>

<p>Even babies can lead play. You can follow your baby’s eye direction to see what she’s interested in.</p>

<p>For example, ‘Is that Auntie there on the sofa? What’s she doing? Is she waving at you?’ If your baby responds with gurgles or babble, keep talking as though you’re having a conversation.</p>

<p>Or if you see your baby looking at a toy, like a brightly coloured rattle, move it closer to him, and let him try to hold it or shake it.</p>",10721,55,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57",59,60,"4831, 76, 226, 206",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/letting-your-child-lead-play"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/letting-your-child-lead-play</a></p>",en,published
1971,Movement and play: newborns,"Through play, newborns learn what their bodies can do and build their motor skills.Newborns gain more control of their bodies as they develop during the early weeks.Play ideas for newborn motor development include tummy time, floor time and, as they get a bit older, play with rattles and dangling objects.","<h2>Newborn play: why it’s important for movement and motor skills development</h2>

<p>Play gives newborns lots of practice at moving different parts of their bodies, which helps to develop gross motor skills and fine motor skills. As you play with your newborn, he’ll become stronger and more coordinated.</p>

<p>Through play, newborns and young babies also learn how to interact with their environment and discover what their bodies can do. For example, when you hold a toy close to your baby and he reaches for it (after the newborn period), your baby discovers that he can move his arms to touch nearby objects.</p>

<p>Give your baby lots of encouragement and praise, and be amazed at what she can do. This makes her feel loved and valued, and builds the confidence she needs to try lots of new movements.</p>

<h2>What to expect: newborn movement</h2>

<p>In the <strong>first four weeks of life</strong>, a lot of your baby’s movements are reflexes, so he can’t really control them. For example, when you stroke your baby’s cheek, by reflex your baby turns to that side to suckle.</p>

<p>In your baby’s first four weeks, she might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>look at your face and follow side-to-side movements with her eyes</li>
	<li>lift her head for short periods of time when lying on her tummy.</li>
</ul>

<p>As your baby starts to <strong>gain more control of his movements</strong>, he might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>uncurl his fists and swipe at dangling objects</li>
	<li>lift his head while lying on his tummy and lean on his elbows to look at a toy in front of him, at around 4-8 weeks</li>
	<li>follow your face or a toy that’s moving slowly from side to side or in a circle with his eyes. You might need to be quite close – about 30 cm away – for this to happen</li>
	<li>move and kick his legs, especially in the bath or when out of a nappy, at around 8 weeks</li>
	<li>wave and watch his hands and feet or move his hands towards your face or a toy, at around 12 weeks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your newborn is still learning to control her neck muscles, so it’s important to support her head when you lift her up.</p>

<p>Your baby will be keen to copy your facial expressions almost from birth. If you give your baby a big, bright smile, he’ll try to do the same. Frown – and you’ll see that coming back at you too!</p>

<h2>Play ideas to get your newborn moving</h2>

<p>Here are some play ideas to get your newborn moving and boost your baby’s motor skills development:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Put a toy or rattle in your baby’s hand for your baby to hold.</li>
	<li>Dangle some fun, bright objects above your baby to stimulate her to look and begin to reach. You can put toys within easy reach by attaching a frame over a pram or bouncer and hanging toys from it. Just make sure that your baby can’t get tangled in the strings.</li>
	<li>Sing nursery rhymes with simple actions that encourage your baby to move his body has he gets older.</li>
	<li>Give your baby time on the floor when she can easily move her body. Try not to rush her into doing things before she’s ready. Just enjoy watching her move.</li>
	<li>Give your baby tummy time. Put your baby on his tummy on a firm surface – like the ground – so he can practise pushing up on his elbows and lifting his head as he gets older. Start with 1-2 minutes and build up to 10-15 minutes a day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concerns about baby development</h2>

<p>In general, the key events in baby development happen in a similar order, but the age they happen might vary for each child and even for children in the same family.</p>

<p><strong>You know your baby best.</strong> If you have concerns about your baby’s development, including his movement and play, it’s a good idea to talk with your health care provider.</p>",3266,55,"43,44,45",59,60,"2441, 2446, 2451, 2456, 2461, 2466, 76, 2426, 2431, 2436",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/play-ideas/movement-play-newborns"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/play-ideas/movement-play-newborns</a></p>",en,published
1976,Thinking and play: newborns,"Play is important for newborn cognitive development.Through play, your baby begins to learn about you, their world, and concepts like movement and colour.  Newborn play ideas include talking, sharing books and pictures, singing, exploring outside and playing with soft toys.","<h2>About newborn play and cognitive development</h2>

<p>Play is important for your newborn’s cognitive development – that is, your baby’s developing ability to think, understand, communicate, remember, imagine and work out what might happen next.</p>

<p>This is because newborn play is all about interacting with your baby and responding to your baby’s cues. These responsive interactions stimulate your baby’s brain, creating millions of connections.</p>

<p>Through these interactions your baby also learns about the world – whether the world is safe and secure, whether they’re loved, who loves them and much more.</p>

<p>When your baby feels safe, secure and loved, your baby is likely to have the confidence to keep exploring and learning. And this lays the foundation for your baby’s brain and cognitive abilities to keep developing.</p>

<p>Your warm and loving relationship with your baby lays the foundation for all areas of your child’s learning and development. This means that your relationship with your baby is critical to development.</p>

<h2>What to expect: newborn cognitive development</h2>

<p>Newborn babies have lots to learn and you’ll be amazed at how fast this learning happens.</p>

<p>At first, your baby starts off not even knowing who you are. But by about four weeks, your baby will <strong>recognise and respond to your voice</strong>.</p>

<p>Your newborn will also be fascinated by your face and will gaze at you in wonder, especially when you talk. Your baby is learning to notice and <strong>remember </strong>what you sound and look like.</p>

<p>At this age, your baby might look at a brightly coloured mobile hanging above the cot or sleeping area for a long time. This might seem like a simple activity but your baby is learning to understand concepts like movement and colour.</p>

<p>Babies want to experience the world, but not all at once – too many people, sounds and activities might exhaust your baby. Sometimes too much stimulation will make your baby too tired to sleep, so watch out for those tired signs.</p>

<h2>Play ideas for encouraging newborn cognitive development</h2>

<p>Here are some play ideas to get you going:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Talk to your baby often, hold your baby, and make eye contact.</li>
	<li>Read with your baby, recite nursery rhymes, or sing songs. Repeating the same song, rhyme or story isn’t boring for babies – repetition is one of the ways they learn.</li>
	<li>Make faces with your baby. This is a game you can play together from birth. If you stick out your tongue or make an ‘O’ with your lips, some babies can do the same.</li>
	<li>Give your baby different things to look at, about 20-30 cm from their face. For example, you could use books or baby play gyms to show your baby different colours and shapes.</li>
	<li>Give your baby a soft toy or rattle to reach for and touch. You could try this when your baby is a few weeks old.</li>
	<li>Gently rock, stroke or massage your baby. You could also touch your baby’s toes and fingers and even play a naming game.</li>
	<li>Listen to wind chimes, birds or different types of music.</li>
	<li>Explore outside with your baby – you could go for a walk or visit the park with your baby in a sling or pram.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a good idea to <strong>follow your baby’s lead </strong>during play. For example, if your baby is fascinated by the feel of a teddy bear, join in with the experience. You could even say, ‘Yes, teddy feels soft’. But if your baby isn’t interested in an activity or is too tired to play, it’s probably time to try something else.</p>

<p>There’s a lot for your newborn baby to learn about the world. Depending on your baby’s temperament, you might need to introduce your baby to new play experiences slowly and gently so baby doesn’t feel overwhelmed.</p>",3276,55,"43,44,45",59,60,"4061, 4066, 4071, 4076, 4081, 4086, 76, 2426, 2431, 2436",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/play-ideas/thinking-play-newborns"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/play-ideas/thinking-play-newborns</a></p>",en,published

1986,Toys and games for children,Toys and games for children – how do you know what’s best? Finding toys that your child will enjoy and learn from is about understanding which play ideas suit which age. Toys don't need to be expensive.  Some of the best playthings cost little or nothing.,"<h1><strong>About toys and games for children</strong></h1>

<p><strong>You are the most interesting and important toy </strong>for your child – especially if your child is a newborn, baby, toddler or preschooler.</p>

<p>Making time for play with your child every day helps her/his learning and development – and play builds the relationship between you and your child too.</p>

<p>Parents and carers should be aware of the gender implications of the toys and games they select for their children. For example, girls are often encouraged to play with dolls while boys are encouraged to play outside – this initiates socialization of gender stereotypes of the roles they are traditionally expected to play in society as adults. Instead, parents and carers should aim to develop a holistic range of socio-cognitive and creative skills for children of all genders and ensure that equal play time is allocated for children of all genders.</p>

<p>Here are some more <strong>ideas for choosing toys and games </strong>to suit your child as she/he grows and develops.</p>

<p><strong>Toys and games for newborns</strong></p>

<p><strong>You’re the best ‘toy’ for your newborn. </strong>Newborns love watching your face, listening to your voice and just being with you. Both male and female carers must be encouraged to spend time playing and connecting with newborns.</p>

<p>Newborn play is simple. As your baby grows, she/he’ll enjoy looking at a brightly coloured mobile, listening to a wind-up musical toy or learning to reach for a rattle.</p>

<p><strong>Toys with contrasting colours</strong> like red, black and white are most interesting to newborns. Your baby will also enjoy toys with faces or with patterns like curves or checks.   At this age, things might need to be quite close to your baby for her/him to see them clearly.</p>

<p>Newborns also enjoy your singing--songs from your culture or family traditions, or anything at all! </p>

<p>If your baby looks tired or overwhelmed when you’re playing together, it’s time to take a break.</p>

<p><strong>Toys and games for babies and toddlers</strong></p>

<p>Your baby or toddler will probably enjoy playing with push-along toys, soft balls, cuddly teddies, board or cloth books that can’t be ripped, toy cars, and simple puzzles. You can make light blocks from small boxes or cleaned plastic containers with lids.  Pots and pans are also fun for banging.  Just be careful to check for sharp edges and other hazards</p>

<p><strong>Creative materials </strong>are good too – you could give your child crayons, paints and paper. Free catalogs and old magazines can be ripped and scribbled on.  Make-believe play with simple homemade hand puppets or dress-ups will also be popular.  Homemade playdough can be squeezed and shaped.  Supervise as children still put things in their mouths at this age.</p>

<p>Reading with babies and reading with toddlers is one of the most enjoyable and important things you can do. Try books with bright illustrations and fun rhymes, or make your own.</p>

<p>Outdoor play – for example, in the sandpit with a bucket and spade, or rolling a ball – will also be lots of fun for your toddler.</p>

<p>Children love <strong>playing with water</strong>. In the bath, your child will enjoy playing with just about anything – boats, toy fish, plastic books and coloured foam shapes. Measuring cups and empty plastic containers are fun for splashing, pouring, tipping and floating.  If you have space, a paddling pool will be hugely popular in warm weather.  Safety is key:  Maintain constant visual contact and keeping your child within arm’s reach at all times.</p>

<p>Children at this age start making connections between gender identities and specific characteristics, therefore, marking the beginning of gender socialization. Therefore, parents and carers are encouraged to be aware of the gender implications of the toys, games books and creative material for their children. Parents and carers must avoid material that encourage gender stereotypes, rather using gender neutral or diverse and empowering toys, games and books, and also encourage children to play with toys and games traditionally associated with the opposite gender. Male and female carers are encouraged to engage with children in a range of activities.</p>

<p><strong>Toys and games for preschoolers</strong></p>

<p>Your preschooler is likely to enjoy anything that can be used for <strong>pretending</strong>, like a toy tool box, old mobile phone or dress-up clothes. Your child’s imagination can turn cardboard boxes into lots of things, including a toy stove, letter box, car or boat.  You see that you don't need to spend money to help children play and learn!</p>

<p>You can make <strong>musical instruments</strong> with household objects – for example, plastic jars filled with rice or pasta can be used as shakers. Unbreakable bowls turned upside down become drums when your preschooler has a wooden spoon to bang with.</p>

<p><strong>Quiet play activities</strong> are good for you and your child. Try art activities like paints, crayons, pencils or cutting and pasting. Books and stories, simple board games and puzzles or construction toys are good for these times too.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor equipment</strong> will keep your preschooler busy and active. Balls are fun to throw, hit or kick.  If playgrounds are available, your preschooler will enjoy swings and climbers.  Your own garden can offer fun with boxes to crawl through or a homemade obstacle course--or just running and jumping!</p>

<p>By the age of three children develop a sense of gender identity. At roughly this age parents and carers begin differentiating children based on gender, for example encouraging girls to play with dolls and encouraging boys to play outside. As many children begin school at this age, additional influencers further advance gender socialization. Therefore, it is an important age to promote positive gender socialization through toys, games, and play activities and aim to develop a wide range of socio-cognitive skills. Parents and carers are encouraged to be aware of the gender implications of the toys, games books and creative material for their children. Parents and carers must avoid material that encourage gender stereotypes, rather using gender neutral or diverse and empowering toys, games and books, and also encourage children to play with toys and games traditionally associated with the opposite gender. Moreover, parents and carers should avoid violent or sexualized toys and games, including digital games, and encourage children to translate anger or frustration into problem-solving, positive communication and constructive physical activity.</p>

1991,Choosing toys for your child,There are so many toys out there and juggling your child’s needs and wants – along with advertising and peer influences – can be tricky. But the best toys for kids aren’t the most expensive or most complex – they’re the ones that stimulate your child’s imagination and thinking.,"<p><strong>The best toys for kids</strong></p>

<p>Toys can be a great way to support your child’s development. But your child doesn't need as many toys as you think.</p>

<p>The best toys for children are ‘<strong>open-ended</strong>’. These are the toys that your child can use in lots of different ways. They encourage your child to use her/his imagination, creativity and problem-solving skills. Moreover, the best toys are those that prevent gender stereotypes and instead encourage development of a broad set of socio-cognitive and creative skills.</p>

<p>Open-ended toys include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>blocks – one day your child uses them to build a tower, and the next day she/he might bring the block up to her/his ear and pretend it’s a phone</li>
	<li>balls – they’re great to bounce, look at, roll, hold and throw</li>
	<li>cardboard boxes – your child can pretend these are shop counters, ovens, cars, boats, doll houses and more</li>
	<li>role-playing – with some hand-me-down clothes and bits of fabric, your child can become anything or anyone she/he likes</li>
	<li>creative art materials – coloured paper, paste or glue, crayons and washable markers can spark your child's imagination.</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t always have to buy toys. Everyday household items like pots and pans, plastic containers, clothes baskets and blankets often make great open-ended toys. Just make sure that any household items your child plays with are safe, so avoid sharp objects or small objects that could cause your child to choke.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing toys for children</strong></p>

<p>Many toys have age-range information on their packaging. This can be useful it's only a guide. <strong>Your child’s interests and stage of development </strong>will probably give you a better idea of what to choose.</p>

<p>Age-range information can be important for safety, however – for example, when toys contain small parts that a baby could swallow. In these cases, it’s wise to follow the recommended age-range information.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For your <strong>baby</strong>, the best ‘toy’ is you, a carer or other close family member. Your baby will delight in watching your face, listening to your voice and simply being with you. Even play activities like looking at a brightly coloured mobile and learning to reach for a rattle are more fun when you and your baby do them together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toddlers</strong> love to play with boxes, and often have more fun with the wrapping a present comes in than the present itself. Other good choices for toddlers include building blocks (you can even make from empty milk cartons) and clothing for dress-ups. Toddlers also enjoy simple musical instruments that they can shake and bang, such as a drum made from an upside-down pot and a wooden spoon.</p>

<p><strong>Older children</strong> also love to play pretend. Very simple props around the house - such as a scarf, a cooking spoon, or a hat - give your child all kinds of ideas for make believe. Pre-schoolers usually love blocks and other construction toys, again with home-made options. Puzzles or games that get your child playing with others are also good choices.</p>

<p><strong>Toys and your family values</strong></p>

<p>You’re the person who decides what toys are OK for your child to play with in your home.</p>

<p>If you have strong feelings about certain toys, it can be a good idea to <strong>talk to your child</strong>, especially as she/he grows older. You could mention your family values. For example, ‘Guns can scare and hurt people very much. We don't allow play with toy guns in our family.'  </p>

<p>If you don’t want other grown-ups to give your child certain toys as presents, a short, calm explanation of your feelings should do the trick. In the end, it’s your decision.</p>

1996,Homemade toys and free activities for kids,"Young children don’t need special or expensive toys for learning and development. In fact, with a little imagination, you can turn ordinary things around the house into homemade toys and free activities for kids.","<h2>Homemade toys and free activities: why they’re good</h2>

<p>Homemade games and free activities at home are a great way to keep children entertained, and to help them learn and grow. They don’t cost any money, and they can really boost your child’s creativity.  Especially if you need to stay home because of pandemic quarantines, or your income has become unexpectedly limited, you can still find many wonderful things for children to do.</p>

<p>It’s easy to come up with ideas for children as they get older. There are lots of toys and games that you and your child can create together.</p>

<p>You can also give your child things from around your home for some open-ended play – for example, young children usually love putting on and taking off the lids of containers, and older children often enjoy playing make-believe with old tea towels. Make sure that the things you give your child are unbreakable and too big to be choking hazards.</p>

<h2>Playing with newborns</h2>

<p><strong>You’re the ‘toy’ that your newborn most enjoys.</strong> Your touch, the sound of your voice, being rocked in your arms, or staring at your face is more than enough entertainment for a new baby.</p>

<p>Your newborn will also love being outside when the weather is good, feeling the wind, hearing the sounds of birds, and experiencing new outdoorsy smells.</p>

<p>You could play gentle music to soothe your baby, or make bath time relaxing with a calm atmosphere and warm water, and a warm massage afterwards.</p>

<p>Newborn babies respond to music, but <strong>it’s your voice that they enjoy most</strong>. Hold your baby, sing, talk and make eye contact. These activities will keep your baby entertained, and help your baby learn and get to know you all at once.</p>

<p>All babies are unique and some babies take more time than others to enjoy new sensations, so watch how your baby responds, and see what he enjoys and is interested in. Your baby’s cues can help you know when your baby is happy to play or when he has had enough and wants a rest.</p>

<h2>Playing with babies</h2>

<p>Once your baby starts to move around more, she might enjoy more active play – especially with you.</p>

<p>Your baby will love to crawl all over you or grasp and shake objects to try out new movement skills. All young children need time for quiet play too, so watch for cues that your baby needs some downtime.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>play ideas for babies</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make time for one-on-one play every day – for example, talking with your baby or counting his toes. You can make this a part of routine activities like nappy-changing.</li>
	<li>Blow raspberries on your baby’s tummy and tickle little toes.</li>
	<li>Make a toy shaker. Fill an emptied, washed and dried juice or milk container with rice, pasta, peas, dried pulses or even old buttons (make sure the lid is secure to avoid choking hazards).</li>
	<li>Sing songs and nursery rhymes. Babies really love these when you repeat actions like clapping hands or doing twinkling star fingers.</li>
	<li>Read books as part of your baby’s daily routine – for example, before bedtime. Your <strong>local library</strong> is a great place to borrow books for free, or if the library isn't available, make up stories from your own childhood or traditions.</li>
	<li>Make a drum using upside-down boxes, pots or plastic tubs. Give your baby a wooden spoon to bang the drum with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Playing with toddlers</h2>

<p>Toddlers are like little scientists. Their play is often about experimenting, observing, testing, trying out ideas and figuring out how things work.</p>

<p>You could try the following homemade, free <strong>play ideas for toddlers</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your toddler some pegs and a peg container. Your child will happily move pegs in and out of the container – over and over and over again!</li>
	<li>Cut pieces of cardboard into small envelopes and decorate them. You could also make a ‘post box’ by cutting slits into the front of an old ice-cream container or cardboard box.</li>
	<li>Make some playdough and let her just squelch it between her fingers.  Together you can also build towers, pancakes, balls – whatever your toddler likes.</li>
	<li>Put together a box of old clothes for some dress-up or pretend play.</li>
	<li>Go for some outdoor play wherever space is now available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Find more creative ideas for homemade toys and free activities in our article on encouraging toddlers’ creative and artistic development.</p>

<h2>Playing with preschoolers</h2>

<p>Many of the ideas for toddlers are also wonderful for your preschooler,  Also, try some of the following <strong>play ideas</strong>. They’re fun and will also help with your child’s fine motor skills and gross motor skills:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show your child how to stuff old stockings with paper or material scraps to make creatures like a snake or caterpillar.</li>
	<li>Make a sock puppet using old socks. Sew on buttons or paste other bits of material for eyes, nose and hair.</li>
	<li>Fill a box with clean, old clothes for dressing up.You could use an ice-cream container to make a fun dress-up hat. Cover it with foil, and your preschooler is an astronaut. You can also paste material, fake flowers or pom-poms onto a container to turn your child into a fancy guest at a tea party.</li>
	<li>Fold newspaper into a pirate’s or magician’s hat. Let your preschooler cut out and paste on coloured pictures cut from old magazines.</li>
	<li>Let your child’s imagination turn old cardboard boxes into toys – a car, cubbyhouse, shop counter or kitchen stove.</li>
	<li>If possible now, visit the local park or a friend’s house, or just take a walk in your garden or local neighbourhood. These are all sources of adventure and fun for your child.</li>
	<li>Tape some scrap paper together to make a simple book. Let your child create the story and decorate the pages either by drawing the characters herself or cutting and pasting them out of old magazines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out our article on encouraging preschoolers’ creative and artistic development. It has lots of ideas for using everyday objects to make fun new homemade toys.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Play is the main way babies and young children learn. But if play isn’t fun, it’s not really play. Letting your child lead the play helps to keep things fun. For babies, this might be stopping play if they’re tired. For preschoolers, it might be letting them choose what they want to play with.</p>

2001,Learning in the baby to preschool years,"Right from birth, your child learns by playing and exploring in a safe and stimulating environment.Your child’s key relationships help her learn communication, thinking and problem-solving skills.Your child learns best by being involved in learning, playing actively, and trying lots of different activities with your support and encouragement.","<h2>About learning in the early years</h2>

<p>Babies are born ready to learn, and their brains develop through use. So your child needs a stimulating environment with lots of different ways to learn through play and activity.</p>

<p>Babies and young children learn best when they have warm, engaged and responsive relationships with their main carers. You are your child’s first teacher, but not in a formal ""school"" kind of way.  As you stimulate and encourage early exploration and play, and serve as a loving model, your child will keep learning from you as she gets older.</p>

<h2>How babies and young children learn</h2>

<p>Your child learns best by <strong>actively engaging with her environment, not just sitting passively</strong>. This includes:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>observing interesting things in her world, watching faces and responding to voices</li>
	<li>listening to sounds, making sounds and singing</li>
	<li>exploring – for example, putting things in her mouth--safely!, shaking things and turning things around</li>
	<li>asking questions – for example, ‘But why?’</li>
	<li>experimenting with textures, objects and materials like water, sand or dirt</li>
	<li>doing things that stimulate all of her senses – touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child also learns by being <strong>involved in his learning</strong>. This could be as simple as:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>choosing books to read</li>
	<li>pointing to pictures in books</li>
	<li>choosing objects and toys to play with</li>
	<li>picking out vegetables for dinner</li>
	<li>measuring out flour for muffins.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child has the opportunity to try <strong>lots of different everyday activities</strong> (inside, outside, physically active, quiet, and so on) she has lots of ways to learn and practise what she’s learning.</p>

<p>Your child needs <strong>your support for learning</strong>. For example, he might sometimes need you to show him what to do, and praise and encouragement are always motivating. But it's also important to let your child make mistakes and find out for himself how the world works is a big part of learning.</p>

<h2>How you and your family help your young child learn</h2>

<p>You and your family have a vital role in what your child learns in these early years.  This happens every day, in small ways:</p>

<p><strong>Self and relationships</strong><br />
From you and your family, your child learns that she’s loved and important. She learns trust – for example, ‘I know you’ll be there if I fall over’.</p>

<p><strong>Language and communication</strong><br />
When you talk and listen with your child, and read and sing together, you’re helping him learn about language, written and spoken communication, and conversation skills like taking turns and listening.</p>

<p><strong>Space, place and environment</strong><br />
At home with you, your child learns about her own size and shape – for example, ‘I’m bigger than our stool but not as big as our table’. She also learns about her place in her community and her influence on the world around her. For example, ‘My home is in this street, the park is down the road, and my friend lives in a different street’, or ‘The plants grew because I helped to water them’.</p>

<p><strong>Health and physical fitness</strong><br />
When it comes to healthy eating and physical activity, you’re a key role model for your child. If you choose to have an apple rather than a snack bar for morning tea, your child is more likely to do the same. If you go for a walk rather than watching the TV, your child learns that exercise is a good, fun way to spend time together.</p>

<p><strong>Numeracy, literacy, handwriting and music</strong><br />
You help your child build early numeracy skills with everyday counting – for example, ‘How many bears are on the bed?’ or ‘Can you put all the red pegs into this basket?’ Or you can sing nursery rhymes with your child that include counting.</p>

<p>And your child develops early literacy through reading and storytelling with you, playing simple sound and letter games like listening for words that begin with the same sound, and looking at pictures, letters and words in the environment – for example, on signs and in catalogues.</p>

<p>Your child’s handwriting skills are supported when you encourage him to draw, scribble and pretend to write. For example, if you’re writing a shopping list, you could give your child some paper and a pencil so he can join in. ‘Writing’ also helps your child understand the connection between letters and spoken sounds.</p>

<p>Singing with your child, putting on music for her to dance to, giving her musical instruments to play (homemade is just fine), and finding dress-up clothes for her to use are all great ways to get her started on learning about <strong>music, drama and dance</strong>.</p>

<p>By encouraging your child to try lots of new things, you help her learn more about who she is and what she’s good at.</p>",10716,55,"44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57",59,60,"206, 2411, 2416, 2421",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/learning-ideas/learning-baby-to-preschool"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/learning-ideas/learning-baby-to-preschool</a></p>",en,published

For example, try singing number songs.","<h2>About numeracy and maths skills</h2>

<p>Numeracy is the <strong>ability to apply maths concepts in all areas of life</strong>.</p>

<p>Numeracy skills involve understanding numbers, counting, solving number problems, measuring, sorting, noticing patterns, adding and subtracting numbers and so on.</p>

<p>We all need numeracy and maths skills to do everyday things like:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>solve problems – for example, which brand and size of tinned beans is the cheapest?</li>
	<li>analyse and make sense of information – for example, how many wins does my team need to get to the top of the competition?</li>
	<li>understand patterns – for example, what number would the next house in this street be?</li>
	<li>make choices – for example, which bike is the best value?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child’s everyday experiences are full of learning opportunities that lay the foundations for numeracy, and at the same time create positive attitudes toward numbers, shapes, and all kinds of math concepts.  Help your child find the joy in maths, right from the start!</p>

<h2>How your child starts learning numeracy</h2>

<p>Children start learning numeracy skills from the time they’re born. This learning happens from watching and experiencing numeracy in action, especially in <strong>everyday play and activities</strong>. For example, it happens when you encourage your child to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>count fingers, toes and toys</li>
	<li>recognise numbers and shapes on objects like clocks and phones or in books</li>
	<li>decide how many slices of apple she wants.</li>
</ul>

<p>As your child gets older, he learns <strong>more numeracy and maths skills</strong>, including size and measurement. For example, this happens as he starts to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>compare things of different sizes – ‘big’, ‘small’ and ‘medium’</li>
	<li>group things together and talk about same and different</li>
	<li>use words to describe where things are – ‘over’, ‘under’ and ‘next to’</li>
	<li>help set the table</li>
	<li>fill a water bottle</li>
	<li>help with the shopping and use money to buy things</li>
	<li>divide food into equal shares.</li>
</ul>

<p>And when you talk with your child about maths concepts in your everyday activities, it helps her <strong>understand how and why maths is useful</strong>. For example, this happens when you point out:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>big and small (size)</li>
	<li>high and low (height)</li>
	<li>heavy and light (weight)</li>
	<li>fast and slow (speed)</li>
	<li>close and far (distance)</li>
	<li>first, second and last (order).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Babies: tips for building numeracy skills</h2>

<p>Your baby loves hearing your voice and enjoys stories and songs with repetition, rhyme and numbers. Some things you might already be doing or could start doing with your baby to build numeracy skills include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>reading stories with numbers – for example, ‘Goldilocks and the three bears’</li>
	<li>playing counting games</li>
	<li>singing number songs and rhymes</li>
	<li>changing your tone of voice to describe concepts – for example, a big voice to describe something big, or a little voice to describe something little.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also <strong>talk about</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>everyday activities – for example, ‘Let’s put half of the bird seed here and half over there’ or ‘Let’s find matching socks’</li>
	<li>the environment – for example, ‘Look at the little bird over there’ or ‘That’s a tall tree’</li>
	<li>food – for example, ‘Let’s have two pieces of banana’ or ‘How many cups do we need?’</li>
	<li>time – for example, ‘7 pm, time for bed’</li>
	<li>shapes and patterns – for example, ‘Let’s look for all the triangles’.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s best if you can make these everyday numeracy activities and experiences <strong>playful and relaxed</strong> so that they’re fun for your child.</p>

<h2>Toddlers and preschoolers: tips for building numeracy skills</h2>

<p>Playing with your toddler or preschooler helps your child develop communication, imagination and other skills that help him understand maths concepts. Here are some <strong>ideas to help you and your child enjoy play together</strong> – and learn early maths skills along the way!</p>

<p><strong>Ideas for talking</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Use maths concepts to describe what you and your child are seeing and doing together. For example, ‘Look at the fast cars’ or ‘This bag is heavy’.</li>
	<li>When you’re preparing food, talk about what you’re doing. For example, ‘I’m cutting this orange in half’ or ‘Let’s share these sultanas – one for me and one for you’.</li>
	<li>Point out and name the numbers in your phone number and address.</li>
	<li>When you’re out and about, talk about what’s near or further away. For example, ‘Let’s sit on that bench nearby to have our snack’ or ‘It’s quite far to the lake. Would you like to ride in the stroller?’</li>
	<li>Talk about activities that happen at certain times of the day. For example, ‘We eat breakfast at 7 am’, or ‘Let’s go to the park before we have dinner at 6 pm’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ideas for everyday activities</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Make counting part of your everyday life. For example, count shells at the beach, fruit at the shop and trees on the street, or count toys with your child as he packs them away.</li>
	<li>When you’re out and about, encourage your child to describe or compare shapes of leaves, colours of flowers or sizes of birds.</li>
	<li>Go for a walk down your street and point out how each house or block has a number in a series. Count the steps between one house and the next.</li>
	<li>Use a growth chart or marks on a wall to measure your child’s growing height, and describe to your child what you’re doing.</li>
	<li>Involve your child in cooking. Your child can help stir, pour, fill and mix. This helps your child become familiar with concepts like counting, measuring, adding and estimating.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ideas for play</strong></p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Go for a nature walk and let your child gather a mix of leaves, sticks, pebbles and other natural items. Your child can sort them into groups based on size, colour, shape or what they do.</li>
	<li>Sing songs and read books that have numbers in them that repeat, rhyme and have rhythm. This will help your child understand patterns.</li>
	<li>With preschoolers, play simple board games, card games and puzzles with shapes and numbers, like ‘snap’, or matching pairs or dominoes.</li>
	<li>With preschoolers, play outside games like ‘I spy’, hopscotch, skittles and ‘What’s the time Mr Wolf’.</li>
	<li>Play or sing music at different speeds. Your child can dance, jump or shake musical instruments to slow or fast songs. Sing nursery rhymes slowly and then speed up.</li>
	<li>Race toy cars and talk about which came first, second or third.</li>
	<li>Help your child to arrange her favourite toys in order from shortest to tallest.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children learn best when they’re interested in something. If your child is doing something he’s particularly interested in – whether it involves dinosaurs, dolls, cars, building, insects or whatever – you can use and explore maths concepts with him while he plays.</p>

<p><strong>Using books and reading</strong><br />
Look at the books you have at home or are in your library for maths ideas.  There are many books that include counting, size, shape, and other maths concepts.  Advertising flyers or catalogs also have lots of numbers, sizes (little shirt, bigger shirt, which size?). </p>",4741,55,"49,50,51,52",59,60,"4141, 4146, 4151, 4156",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/learning-ideas/early-numeracy"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/learning-ideas/early-numeracy</a></p>",en,published
2011,Reading and storytelling with babies and children,"Reading and storytelling with your child promotes brain development and imagination, teaches your child about language and emotions, and strengthens your relationship.You don’t always need to read books. Try looking at picture books, singing rhymes and songs, or telling stories from your culture. Try to share at least one book or story each day.","<h2>Why reading is important for babies and young children</h2>

<p>Sharing stories, talking and singing every day <strong>helps your child’s development in lots of ways</strong>.</p>

<p>Sharing stories with your child doesn’t mean you have to read. Just by <strong>looking at books with your child</strong>, you can be a great storyteller and a good model for using language and books.</p>

<p>Reading stories with children has benefits for grown-ups too. The special time you spend reading together <strong> helps to build your relationship</strong>.</p>

<p>You can start reading aloud to your baby as early as you like – the earlier the better. Your baby will love being held in your arms, listening to your voice, hearing rhyme and rhythm, and looking at pictures. </p>

<h2>Storytelling and songs</h2>

<p>Reading isn’t the only way to help with your child’s language and literacy development.</p>

<p>Telling stories, singing songs and saying rhymes together are also great activities for early literacy skills – and your child will probably have a lot of fun at the same time.</p>

<p>You might like to make up your own stories or share family stories. Your child will learn words and develop language skills from the songs, stories and conversations you share together.</p>

<h2>Reading to your child in other languages</h2>

<p>You can read, sing and tell stories with your child in <strong>whatever language you feel most comfortable speaking</strong>.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if the country's majority language isn’t your child’s home language language. A good foundation in a while's first language actually helps your child learn the second language more easily later.</p>

<p>If you like, you can talk about the pictures in the book instead of reading the words. Could you and your child make up a story together? Do what you can and as much as you’re comfortable with.</p>

<h2>When to read, sing and tell stories with your child</h2>

<p>Bedtime, bath time, potty time, on the train, on the bus, in the car, in the park, in the pram, in the cot, when you’re in the GP’s waiting room ... any time is a good time for a story! <strong>You can make books part of your daily routine</strong> – take them with you to share and enjoy everywhere.</p>

<p>Knowing when to stop can be just as important as finding the time to share a story in the first place. Pay attention to your child’s reaction to the story, and stop if he isn’t enjoying it this time. You can always try a book, song or story at another time.</p>

<p><strong>If you don’t have a book or can’t make up a story on the spot, don’t worry.</strong> There are many other ways you and your child can share letters, words and pictures. For example, you can look at:</p>

<ul>
	<li>packages at home or in the supermarket, especially food packaging</li>
	<li>clothing – what does it say on the t-shirt? What colour is it?</li>
	<li>letters and notes – what do they say? Who sent them?</li>
	<li>signs in shops, or on buses and trains if you can travel, or in magazines or catalogs if not – point out signs that have the same letters as your child’s name</li>
	<li>menus in restaurants or online – it can be fun for older children to look at menus and work out what they want to eat.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for sharing books with babies and young children</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make a routine and try to share at least one book every day. Children who are read to become better readers!  Find a reading chair where you’re both comfortable.</li>
	<li>Turn off your devices and find a quiet place to read.</li>
	<li>Hold your child close or on your knee while you read, so she can see your face and the book.</li>
	<li>Try out funny noises and sounds – play and have fun!</li>
	<li>Make the book-reading ""interactive""--stop and say things like ""Ooh, what do you think will happen next?"" or ""Do you see the cat?  Who has a cat in our family?"" Involve your child by encouraging talk about the pictures, and by repeating familiar words and phrases.</li>
	<li>Let your toddler choose the books when he’s old enough to start asking – and be prepared to read his favourite books over and over again!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have older children, they can share books with your younger children, or you can all read together. Taking turns, asking questions and listening to the answers are all <strong>important skills </strong>that will help your child when she starts learning to read.</p>

<p>Even reading for a few minutes at a time is effective – you don’t always have to finish the book.</p>

<h2>What sort of books to read with your child</h2>

<p>There are so many books to choose from that it can be hard to know where to start.</p>

<p>As a broad rule, young children often enjoy books, songs and stories that have <strong>good rhyme, rhythm and repetition</strong>.</p>

<p>Choose books that are the right length for your child and that match your child’s changing interests.</p>

<p>For a guide to what might suit your child, you might like to look at the following articles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reading with babies from birth</li>
	<li>Reading with babies from 12 months</li>
	<li>Reading with toddlers</li>
	<li>Reading with preschoolers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to try new books or magazines without much cost, perhaps you could arrange book swaps with friends who have children the same age.</p>

<h2>Using a local library</h2>

<p>If you are able to get to a free library in your community, you'll find that libraries have a lot to offer for you and your child.  Borrowing books, if that is possible in your situation, means you will always have new things to read with your child. </p>

<p>Taking your child to the library and letting her choose her own books can be a fun adventure.</p>

<p>Many libraries offer <strong>story times</strong> and activities for young children.</p>",3306,55,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"246, 4161, 4166, 4171, 4176, 4181, 4186, 4191, 4196, 4201, 4206, 4211, 4216, 4221, 4226, 4231",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/play/reading-storytelling"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/play/reading-storytelling</a></p>",en,published
2016,Reading with babies from birth,"Reading, storytelling, talking and singing with your baby helps her learn about sounds, words and language.Babies enjoy listening to books with good rhyme, rhythm and repetition.","<h2>Why reading with your baby is important</h2>

<p>Sharing stories, talking and singing <strong>helps your baby’s development in lots of ways</strong>.</p>

<p>Doing these activities every day helps your baby get familiar with sounds, words, language and, eventually, the value and joy of books. This good start actually helps him be a successful reader later in life.  It’s a great time for you to <strong>bond with your baby</strong> and share time together, too.</p>

<p>As your baby grows, reading stories also stimulates her imagination and helps her learn about the world around her.</p>

<p>You can start reading aloud to your baby as early as you like – the earlier the better. Our articles on reading stories with babies and children and developing literacy have more information to get you started.</p>

<h2>Sharing books with your baby</h2>

<p>Even young babies can enjoy and benefit from reading books with you. For example, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>read slowly and spend time on each page after you read the words – this lets your baby focus on the shape of words and pictures</li>
	<li>point out and name familiar and new things your baby sees on the page, instead of reading the words</li>
	<li>change the tone of your voice as you read – make it interesting for you and your baby</li>
	<li>Set up a special reading space at home – for example, a cozy chair that’s big and comfortable enough for you and baby (like a nursing chair), with a box of books or bookshelf nearby.</li>
	<li>Make a routine, and try to share at least one book every day. For example, sharing a book can be a relaxing way to end the day.</li>
	<li>Turn off your devices, and find a quiet space so your baby can hear your voice.</li>
	<li>Try out funny noises and sounds – play and have fun!</li>
	<li>Hold the book fairly close to your baby so she can see. You can hold your baby close, on your knee or sit in front of her while you read, so she can see your face too.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>What to read with your baby</h2>

<p>In general, babies enjoy books that have <strong>good rhymes, rhythm and repetition</strong>. This repetition and rhyming helps children learn.</p>

<p>From when your baby is born, you might look for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>books with bright colours or simple, large and high-contrast pictures like black and white pictures  – these are interesting and easy for babies to focus on</li>
	<li>books with different textures so your baby can hear, see and feel the book</li>
	<li>books with pictures of babies and faces</li>
	<li>soft, waterproof plastic and cloth books that can go in your baby’s mouth and into the bath.</li>
</ul>

<p>And remember, if you don't have books, tell your baby stories, sing songs you love, look at and talk about family pictures--anything that brings you together is great!</p>",4831,55,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"246, 4161, 4166, 4171, 4176, 4181, 4186, 4191, 4196, 4201, 4206, 4211, 4216, 4221, 4226, 4231",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/reading-stories/reading-from-birth"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/play-learning/reading-stories/reading-from-birth</a></p>",en,published

2026,Screen time: babies and toddlers,It’s best for children under two years to have no screen time other than video-chatting with family.You can begin to help your baby or toddler learn healthy screen habits by role-modelling healthy screen habits.Be aware of what your child might be seeing on screens in your home. Some media and other images can be distressing.,"<h2>Screen time for babies and toddlers</h2>

<p>Current international guidelines recommend <strong>that children under two years don’t have screen time other than video-chatting with family</strong>.</p>

<p>Very young children learn best from real-world experiences like physical play, playing outside, reading, creative play and social time with family and friends.</p>

<p><strong>Video-chatting</strong> is OK because your child is interacting with another person. Video-chatting can support your child’s social and language development. It can also help to create bonds with family and friends, especially when the pandemic limits in-person connections.</p>

<p>If your baby or toddler is going to be exposed to media like apps or TV programs (perhaps because older children are watching), it’s important to strictly limit time and to use age-appropriate, quality content.</p>

<h2>Role-modelling healthy screen time habits</h2>

<p>Even if you are not exposing your baby or toddler to screens, he sees how you use them and begins to learns screen time habits from you.</p>

<p>Even when your child is very young you can start modelling healthy screen use for the future. For example, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>switch your phone off during dinner</li>
	<li>turn the TV off when you’ve finished watching a program</li>
	<li>balance your screen use with activities like being outdoors, reading and doing physical activity</li>
	<li>give your child your full attention and avoid checking your phone when you’re playing with her or feeding her.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exposure to screens</h2>

<p>Your family may have a number of devises like mobile phones, televisions, computers, and tablets. This means that your baby or toddler might see images on these screens when others are using them.</p>

<p>It’s good to be aware of what your child might be seeing.  For example, some images on the news or in video games can be quite violent and distressing, even for very young children who might not fully understand what they’re seeing.  Protect young children from these kinds of images and consider their effects on older children as well.</p>",4826,55,"47,48,49,50,51,52",59,60,"406, 3531, 3536, 3541, 3546",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/media-technology/healthy-screen-time-0-2-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/media-technology/healthy-screen-time-0-2-years</a></p>",en,published
2031,Playing with premature babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit,"Playing helps you and your premature baby bond. It also helps your baby develop.You can use sight, touch and sound to play with your baby.Watch your baby’s body language so you know when she’s had enough play.","<h2>Playing with premature babies</h2>

<p>If your baby is premature, she probably will spend extra time in a special part of the hospital such as a NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit).  You will need to talk with the staff to learn when are the best times and best ways to play with your baby during this time.  Playing with your premature baby is important!  It helps:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>you and your baby get to know each other</li>
	<li>your baby’s brain develop</li>
	<li>your baby feel loved and secure</li>
	<li>your baby learn about relationships and comfort</li>
	<li>your baby learn about the physical environment he can see, hear, feel and smell</li>
	<li>your baby learn new skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>At first your premature baby will be able to play for only a few minutes at a time. She might be easily overwhelmed by everything that’s going on around and inside her. As your baby grows and gets stronger, she’ll be able to play for longer.</p>

<p>When you first start playing with your baby, it’s a good idea to <strong>stimulate only one of his senses at a time</strong> – for example, just sight or just hearing. And you should stop playing if your baby’s body language tells you he’s had enough. He might show this by looking away, shutting his eyes or getting fussy.</p>

<p>Don’t worry if play doesn’t go well every time. Some days your baby might get agitated or overstimulated or just not respond.</p>

<h2>Play ideas for the NICU: things to look at</h2>

<p>Your baby might enjoy having <strong>something to look at</strong>, especially if it’s your face. In fact, very young premature babies might not want to look at anything other than faces.</p>

<p>After a while, your baby might like watching you gently waggle your fingers or move your head slowly from side to side. And as your baby gets stronger, she might like having new things to look at. Some NICUs have prams that you can use to take babies for walks to look at new things.</p>

<h2>Play ideas for the NICU: touch and massage</h2>

<p>Touching your baby is another way to start playing together.</p>

<p>And when your baby is a bit older and your doctor says it’s OK, you could massage him. Massage is a great way to bond with your baby, and it may also help your baby gain weight.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to avoid using your fingertips to touch your premature baby. This can be too stimulating and even slightly painful for young preemies.</p>

<h2>Play ideas for the NICU: songs, stories and books</h2>

<p>Your premature baby might enjoy hearing your voice and love being talked to, read to and sung to. You can do this from very early on with your baby. Try singing or talking softly to keep the noise level down in the NICU.</p>

<p>You might hum to your baby, or sing the same song over and over. Or you could make up a song using your baby’s name or what’s happening around you. If you want to play music to your premature baby in hospital, just check with the medical staff first.</p>

<p>Babies learn to recognise songs and tunes quickly and also learn that they can mean certain things. For example, some songs mean it’s time to go to sleep, some might mean it’s nappy change time, and so on.</p>

<p>When singing matches how your baby is feeling, it can improve your baby’s heart rate, sleeping, calorie intake and sucking. This can be as simple as singing softer and slower when baby is unsettled.</p>

<p>Singing is good for you too. It helps you breathe deeply and can help you feel more relaxed at this important time in your, and your baby's, life.</p>

Make sure preschoolers balance screen time with other activities, and use quality digital media. Get answers to your questions about screen time.","<h2>Screen time and screen use: part of a healthy lifestyle</h2>

<p>Screen time is never advised for children under age two (except video chats with family), and limited time across the early childhood years.  For preschool children, it is possible for some screen time and screen use to be a normal part of life. </p>

<p>It’s all about <strong>making sure of</strong> <strong>two things</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Young children's routines emphasize lots of healthy, fun activities, including physical activity, reading, creative play and social time with family and friends.</li>
	<li>When children do use screens, they watch or use quality content.</li>
</ul>

<p>And<strong> don’t forget sleep!</strong> A healthy, balanced lifestyle for children includes enough good-quality sleep.</p>

<h2>Checklist for a healthy approach to screen time</h2>

<p>These questions can help you check whether your preschool-aged child is using screens in a balanced and healthy way.</p>

<p>Is your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>sleeping enough?</li>
	<li>physically healthy?</li>
	<li>engaged with child care or school?</li>

	<li>having fun and learning while using screens?</li>
	<li>using quality content?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you <strong>answer yes to most or all of these questions</strong>, your child is probably using screens in a balanced way as part of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Questions or concerns about screen time</h2>

<p>It’s important to have questions or concerns about whether your family has a healthy and balanced approach to screen time.   Some articles in this app, and other resources, may help with these concerns.  Most important is to notice your child's development, emotional state, and breadth of interests, and react to those thoughtfully.</p>

2041,Posting photos and blogging about your child online,"Posting photos of or comments about your child can be a nice way to share your child’s special moments, especially when you cannot be with family in person. But be aware of privacy concerns, as images and comments can’t be entirely removed from the internet.  With older children, also ask how your child feels about you posting photos, videos and comments about her.","<h2>Why parents post photos of and information about children</h2>

<p>Many families share photos of and information about children online. For example, you might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>share family holiday photos on social media</li>
	<li>share baby pictures</li>
	<li>contribute to Facebook groups – for example, if your child plays on a local team</li>
	<li>contribute to advocacy websites – for example, if your child has a disability or other special needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Especially in the time of the coronavirus pandemic, many families connect digitally, through photos, videos, and writings about family doings.  These can be important ways to keep family and friends up to date with how your child and family are doing.  However, there are things to think about.</p>

<h2>Posts about your child: things to think about</h2>

<p>If you write about your child or post photos of him online, remember that the information can never be fully erased from the internet.  Others whom you do not know may have access to information you wish to keep private.  Child exploitation is a real concern.</p>

<p>For many reasons, when your child is a bit older, it is also important to <strong>find out how your child feels </strong>about the photos and information you share about him.</p>

<h2>Talking with your child about posting and blogging</h2>

<p>To start with, it’s always a good idea to ask your child if she’s happy for you to post a particular photo or video of her. Children as young as three can say whether they like a photo of themselves. If your child is too young to give a preference, just use your own judgment.</p>

<p>Even if your child is OK with you posting about her now, she might ask you to delete a photo or post of her in the future.  But remember that even when you delete photos, you can’t entirely remove them from the internet if other people have shared them.</p>

<p>By asking your child about his preferences and respecting those preferences, you’re modelling good digital etiquette for your child, which helps him become a good digital citizen.when he gets older.</p>

<h2>Balancing privacy and sharing in blogs and posts about children: tips</h2>

<p>If your child is OK with you sharing some information or images of her, it’s still a good idea to try to find a balance between protecting your child’s privacy and safety, and sharing your family life, especially on public sites.</p>

<p>Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoid mentioning your child’s name on advocacy sites or other public sites.</li>
	<li>Avoid posting photos that might identify where your child lives or goes to school.</li>
	<li>Avoid posting personal information that could identify your child, like date of birth or address.</li>
	<li>Be aware that the photos you post could be modified and shared.</li>
	<li>Use email or message apps to send photos to family and friends.</li>
	<li>Create private ‘virtual family albums’ to share with close family and friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most important things you can do is make sure that the images and information you post <strong>send a positive message about your child</strong>. For example, you might decide not to post a video of your child crying and choose something positive instead.</p>",4866,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"406, 341, 4906",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/media-technology/posting-photos-of-children"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/media-technology/posting-photos-of-children</a></p>",en,published

<p>If your family has a healthy relationship with screens, you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>all try to use screens in ways that are good for your family relationships</li>
	<li>avoid screen use for the youngest family members</li>
	<li>each get to use screens to meet your individual needs and interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can achieve a healthy family relationship with screens by talking about screen time together and agreeing on basic rules and principles for family screen use.</p>

<p>Our five-step guide below can get your family off to a good start.</p>

<h2>Step 1: role-model healthy screen use</h2>

<p>Your screen use and how you talk about it sends powerful messages to your child about the place screens should have in family life. For example, if you always have your phone with you at home, your child learns that phones are very important.</p>

<p>Keeping track of your screen use can help you understand the messages you might be sending. If your phone has a tracking feature, you could use this to track your use. With older children, you could ask them to keep track as well. You and your child could compare your usage and talk about whether there’s anything you’d like to change.</p>

<p>It’s also good to talk with your older child about the apps you use, the people and groups you follow, or interesting things you’ve read. This helps to create a safe, trusting environment at home where it’s OK to talk openly about screen use.</p>

<h2>Step 2: get to know your child's development and potential as a technology user</h2>

<p>Remember, children under age 2 should not be using technology for any purpose, except video calls to keep connected with family.  Preschoolers' use, too, should be limited and balanced with lots of physical and social play.  Getting to know your child as a current and potential technology user will help you understand his technology interests, needs and worries. You can do this by asking your older child to talk about how he uses screens and what he uses them for.</p>

<p>You might find that your child uses screens in ways that you just don’t understand. You could ask your child to teach you a game so that you get a sense of why she likes it so much.</p>

<h2>Step 3: use good-quality content</h2>

<p>Good-quality content is essential for your developing child.  The content has extra value if it ties in with his interests, sparks his imagination or adds depth to something he’s learning at school.</p>

<p>Encourage your older child to use good-quality apps, games, TV shows, movies and YouTube videos by talking with her about the information, ideas and activities in the media she’s using. You can also help your child make informed choices by showing your child how to find reliable reviews of digital media and content.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to let your child see you making good-quality choices about what you use or watch. Talking about your choices with your child is important too.</p>

<p>Many families have multiple devices in their home--phones, computers, and so on.  Be aware of what even very young children might be seeing. For example, some images on the news or in video games can be quite violent and distressing, even for young children who don’t understand what they’re seeing.</p>

<h2>Step 4: negotiate family screen use rules</h2>

<p>Rules are a way of managing screen time. They can help everyone understand your family’s expectations about screen use. Here are some <strong>questions to help you negotiate family screen use rules</strong>:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Who is allowed to watch devices?  (keep ages and development in mind)</li>
	<li>When and where can devices be used in your home? For example, in family rooms but not bedrooms?</li>
	<li>Are any particular websites, games or apps off limits? Which ones, and why?</li>
	<li>What information is OK to share online?</li>
	<li>Are there some games or movies that need to be saved until younger children have gone to bed?</li>
	<li>What happens if someone breaks the rules?</li>
</ul>

<p>Your rules about screen use should be flexible enough to cover school days, weekends and holidays. The rules also need to take into account your child’s changing needs and interests as he grows.</p>

<p>It’s a good idea to revisit the rules every few months and whenever you introduce a new screen into your home. This helps you ensure the rules are still meeting everyone’s needs.</p>

<h2>Step 5: use screens together</h2>

<p>While avoiding screens for your younger ones, using screens with older children can be fun as long as you are doing many other things together.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for occasionally sharing screen time:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Search online with your child for something that you’re both interested in – for example, a weekend activity, or a new recipe to cook for dinner.</li>
	<li>Play an ongoing game with your older child, like online Scrabble. This is fun and can be something special that just the two of you do.</li>
	<li>Download a music app, then share and discuss the music you’re listening to.</li>
	<li>Get your child to teach you how to play an online game she enjoys, or take you on a ‘tour’ of her apps and favourite websites.</li>
	<li>Get active while using technology together – for example, go for a hike using a mapping app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any time you spend with your child sharing his interests is a good opportunity to build trust, connection and communication. That’s true online as well as offline – look for opportunities to enjoy your child’s enthusiasm for all aspects of the world.</p>",4811,55,"50,51,52,57,58",59,60,4236,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article:<a href=""//raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/media-technology/family-technology-use""> https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/media-technology/family-technology-use</a></p>",en,published
2051,Parents and screen time: role-modelling for children,"Healthy screen use is about how long you spend on screens and what you use screens for. Your child is strongly influenced by the way you use screens and is likely to copy what you do. When you take a healthy and responsible approach to screen time, you set a powerful example for your child.","<h2>What is healthy screen use?</h2>

<p>Healthy screen use is <strong>using technology in balanced and positive ways</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s about <strong>what you use your screens for as well as how much time you spend using them</strong>. It’s also about making sure that screen time is just one of the ways that you relax and entertain yourself – not the only way.</p>

<h2>How your approach to screens influences your child</h2>

<p>Your child is <strong>strongly influenced by the way you use screens</strong> and is likely to copy what you do, especially as he/she gets older.</p>

<p>For example, if you enjoy scrolling through social media for a little while and then going for a family walk, it sends your child the message that social media is just one option for entertaining yourself and relaxing. It also gives your child ideas for other ways to spend his/her time.  Especially for preschoolers, create an environment with lots of creative, active options and materials--see the this app's many articles for no-cost tips.</p>

<p>But if you get agitated about being offline for an hour, this sends a different message. Likewise, taking your phone into the bathroom when you shower might send the message that you really can’t live without a phone.</p>

<p>Screens can get in the way of interactions between parents and children – for example, if parents interrupt conversations with children to check text messages. If this happens often, children might feel they’re not important. This can also lead to behaviour like whining or tantrums because children can’t get their parents’ attention with positive behaviour.</p>

<h2>Role-modelling healthy screen time: tips</h2>

<p>Here are some ideas for healthy screen time that you can use to set a good example for your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Set aside some phone-free time each day, so you can be ‘in the moment’ with your child. This could be when your child gets home from child care or school or you get home from work, during family mealtimes, when you’re outside with your child and so on.</li>
	<li>If you get a text message or social media update while you’re talking to someone, especially your child, wait until the conversation is finished before you check it.</li>
	<li>Try not to have your phone, tablet or laptop in your bedroom at night. Charge your devices overnight in a family area.</li>
	<li>Switch off the TV at family mealtimes or when it’s ‘on in the background’. You could try listening to some music instead.</li>
	<li>Work with your children to create a family media plan. Different parts of the plan will apply to different ages. This must include avoidance of screens entirely until age 2, and very limited exposure for preschoolers. You could include things like no mobiles phone at mealtimes. Then make sure you follow the guidelines in the plan too!</li>
	<li>Use screens in a positive way – for example, to keep in touch with family and friends by sending texts, making video calls or using social media.  This is the only kind of screen use that's recommended for babies and toddlers.</li>
	<li>Take breaks and move around regularly when you’re using screens. And use your device at eye level for good posture.</li>
	<li>Avoid always using screens to entertain your child in situations like long car journeys or appointments. Try mixing it up with things like guessing games, reading or drawing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep track of your screen time for a week. Include all your screen use – TV, video games, social media, texts and so on. If you think you’re using screens more than you’d like to, reduce your use.</p>

<h2>Role-modelling healthy social media use: tips</h2>

<p>Healthy social media use can keep you connected with friends and interests, the latest news, your child’s school and sports activities, and so on.</p>

<p>If you use and enjoy social media, there are plenty of ways you can be a role model for your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Regularly check the privacy settings on your social media accounts.</li>
	<li>Be careful about the photos and comments you post and the photos and comments you’re tagged in. Make sure you’re always respectful in your posts.</li>
	<li>Talk about your social media use with your older children child. This will encourage him to be open about his social media use too. If you share fun content with each other, it can be a great way to talk about the things you both like and think are important.</li>
	<li>Ask your older child for permission before you post a photo of her or share information about her in a public way.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your screen time feels out of control, try to change the ways you use technology.  Friends can support one another if the habit is hard to break. If your child sees you trying to manage your screen time, this sets a good example for him too.</p>",4806,55,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"4236, 4911, 406, 3531",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/media-technology/parent-technology-use"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/grown-ups/family-life/media-technology/parent-technology-use</a></p>",en,published
2056,Emotions and play: babies,Your baby often expresses and learns about emotions through play. Here are some play ideas for helping your baby express his feelings and explore the world around him.,"<h2>Baby emotions and play</h2>

<p>Babies are only just starting to learn about their emotions and how to express them. <strong>Play</strong> is the natural way that babies learn and develop, and play gives them a chance to explore and express feelings like happiness or frustration.</p>

<p>And that’s where you come in. Through play with your baby, you can help your baby learn to communicate emotions.</p>

<p>Play with your baby is mostly about back-and-forth interactions with you – it’s not all about toys. Just making faces with you is a game for your baby. And as you gaze into each other’s eyes, you build your relationship too.</p>

<p>Babies can tell you a lot about what they’re feeling using body language. Our Baby Cues video guide shows you common baby cues to help you understand what your baby might be saying.</p>

<h2>What to expect from baby emotions</h2>

<p>Your baby is likely to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>laugh aloud at 2-4 months</li>
	<li>begin to withdraw from strangers and be more anxious with new people from about eight months – this is called stranger anxiety</li>
	<li>prefer you to any other adult and be clingy towards you from about eight months</li>
	<li>show signs of separation anxiety from about eight months, even when you just walk out of a room in your own home</li>
	<li>give loving cuddles from 10 months.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage baby emotions</h2>

<p>Here are some play ideas to help your baby explore and express emotions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Make music with your baby. </strong>Musical play like singing or making sounds with toys or simple instruments can help children let their emotions out.</li>
	<li><strong>Use touch when you play with your baby. </strong>This can help your baby express emotions. You could try rhymes like ‘This little piggy went to market’ and tickle your baby’s feet as you sing.</li>
	<li><strong>Try messy play</strong> with sand, mud, paints and other gooey substances. This can help your older baby get used to the way different things make her feel. For example, your baby can slap mud around happily, or slosh water angrily.  Just supervise closely.</li>
	<li><strong>Use puppets or toys to begin to explain simple emotions.</strong> For example, you can use puppets or toys and say things like ‘The car is happy because the bus is going for a drive with him’ or ‘The mouse is sad so the cat will give him a cuddle’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although play is important for learning and development, it’s mostly about having fun. If it isn’t fun, it isn’t play. So it’s important to follow your baby’s lead when it comes to play. Your baby’s body language will let you know when she’s interested in playing and when she’s had enough.</p>

<h2>When to seek help for baby emotions</h2>

<p>Children grow and develop at different rates. In general, the key moments in development happen in the same order, but the age they happen might vary for each child, even for children in the same family.</p>

<p>You might want to talk with your health provider if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your baby regularly turns his face away from you and won’t look into your eyes</li>
	<li>your baby rarely uses his face to communicate feelings – for example, he doesn’t show you when he’s happy or upset.</li>

2061,"Exploring, imagining, creating and play: babies","Play helps babies develop their ability to explore, imagine, and be creative. Between birth and 12 months, your baby will be fascinated by you, by herself and by the world around her. Play ideas to develop baby imagination and creativity include peekaboo, books, treasure boxes, nature walks, messy play and more.","<h2>Baby play: why it’s important for imaginative and creative development</h2>

<p>Between birth and 12 months, your baby becomes more interested in the world all the time. Play is the main way that babies develop, learn and explore the world.</p>

<p>As babies explore through play, their imaginations develop. And as their imaginations develop, they can experiment with new sounds, sights, objects and activities. They also learn to solve simple problems, and they start being able to understand their own and other people’s feelings.</p>

<h2>What to expect as your baby’s imagination develops</h2>

<p>Your baby is likely to be <strong>fascinated by you</strong>. Your face, facial expressions, voice and touch spark his imagination and help him learn.</p>

<p>At the same time, your baby will <strong>enjoy looking at pictures in books</strong>.</p>

<p>Babies are <strong>naturally curious about the environment</strong> and are keen to explore, especially once they can crawl. Your baby might look into cupboards, under beds and around the house. When she does this she’s imagining what she might find there and what she can do with whatever she finds.</p>

<p>At 5-6 months, <strong>touching and tasting</strong> are how your baby explores, which is why he seems to put everything in his mouth.</p>

<p>Around this age, your baby will also enjoy seeing <strong>what happens when she bangs things together</strong> or uses her voice. From about seven months, she might try to copy you if you make different sounds.</p>

<p>And from about eight months, your baby will start using his imagination to copy what he’s seen you do. Your baby might use a block as a mobile phone or play peekaboo by hiding his face behind a cushion.</p>

<h2>Play ideas and creative activities to help your baby’s imagination grow</h2>

<p>Here are some <strong>indoor play ideas for your baby</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Play peekaboo with objects like scarves or tea towels.</li>
	<li>Sit your baby in front of a mirror. Young babies can look at the mirror while lying on their sides or tummies.</li>
	<li>Put toys, open books or different objects in front of your baby.</li>
	<li>Look at photos of different people and places. Talk to your baby about what he sees.</li>
	<li>Read book and share stories or sing nursery rhymes using actions together. For example, do twinkly star fingers while singing ‘Twinkle, twinkle little star’.</li>
	<li>Listen to different types and styles of music and get your baby involved. You could use a bucket and wooden spoons for a drum. A plastic jar full of uncooked rice can be a shaker – just make sure the lid is on tightly.</li>
	<li>Make a treasure box for your baby, full of everyday items and natural objects for your baby to touch and feel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some <strong>outside play ideas for your baby:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Look outdoors for new and interesting natural objects. Let your baby explore them with her senses. She could feel the roughness of a tree trunk or smell a flower.</li>
	<li>Go for a nature walk in your own yard, or (if you can) at a playground or beach--anywhere there are different things to see, hear and feel.  Even a city street has nature.  Look for grass growing in pavement cracks!</li>
	<li>Give your baby tummy time on a mat outdoors. This lets your baby see the world in a new way.</li>
	<li>Try messy play using sand, mud, clay, playdough or paints. Just make sure these materials are non-toxic,  and that you supervise carefully, because your baby’s fingers are likely to end up in his mouth at some stage.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Open-ended play </strong><br />
Open-ended play is good for your baby’s imagination. Blocks, including homemade blocks from milk cartons or plastic containers, are great for open-ended play.  Your baby can use them for all sorts of things--banging, building, piling up.  As she gets older, she'll pretend: block can be a car, a phone, and much more.</p>

<p>Getting your baby moving through play is good for all areas of his development, especially his physical development.</p>

<p>Play helps your baby:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>strengthen the neck and upper body muscles that she needs to hold her head up and move around</li>
	<li>practise reaching and grasping</li>
	<li>strengthen muscles for movements like rolling, crawling and pulling to stand.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re the ""plaything"" that interests your baby most. Playing and moving with your baby is a great way to bond with your baby.</p>

<h2>What to expect: babies and movement</h2>

<p>At <strong>3-6 months</strong>, your baby might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>reach for toys and roll on to her back during tummy time</li>
	<li>bring her hands to her mouth and reach for her legs and toys when lying on her back</li>
	<li>try rolling from tummy to back and back to tummy.</li>
</ul>

<p>By <strong>6-9 months</strong>, many babies like lying on their tummies rather than on their backs. When babies lie on their tummies, they can reach for toys and move around in a circle. When they’re ready, they might even try to crawl. Other things your baby might do at this age are:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>roll from tummy to back and back to tummy</li>
	<li>sit with your help or by himself</li>
	<li>push up onto his hands and knees</li>
	<li>stand on his legs with your support.</li>
</ul>

<p>From <strong>9-12 months</strong>, your baby might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>crawl, roll and pull to stand</li>
	<li>sit by herself and reach for toys without falling</li>
	<li>move from a sitting position onto her tummy and back again</li>
	<li>play using both hands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key moments in baby development generally happen in the same order, but when they happen might vary from child to child. You can find out what to expect each month in our Baby development tracker.</p>

<h2>Tummy time</h2>

<p>Tummy time is time your baby spends on his stomach while he’s awake. Doing tummy time from soon after birth helps your baby build neck, head and upper body strength to crawl and pull to stand when he’s older.</p>

<p>At first, <strong>your baby might not like tummy time</strong> – You might first try tummy time on your chest or across your lap. This position also lets your baby see your face.</p>

<p>You could also get down on the floor with your baby. Let him know you’re there by singing, talking, stroking his back or tickling his hands.</p>

<p>You can <strong>start with 1-2 minutes of tummy time</strong>, and build up to 5-10 minutes a few times a day as your baby gets used to it.</p>

<p>If your baby just doesn’t like tummy time or keeps being sick from lying on her tummy, it’s a good idea to see your family health provider for a check-up.</p>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage movement</h2>

<p>From <strong>0-6 months</strong>, you could try the following play ideas:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Encourage your baby to move her body by singing songs and rhymes or shaking rattles.</li>
	<li>Place your baby on his tummy to play for short periods several times a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Babies aged <strong>6-12 months</strong> might like the following activities, depending on what parts of her body she's developing as the months go on:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Place toys just out of your baby’s reach to encourage reaching and moving. You can also use simple toys like rattles to encourage touching and holding.</li>
	<li>Give your baby wooden spoons to bang on pots and pans, or sealed containers with beads inside to shake.</li>
	<li>Sit and support your baby upright on the floor, and move a ball or toy in front of her. This encourages your baby to follow the toy with her eyes, reach for it and grasp it.</li>
	<li>Encourage your baby to pull to stand. Sit him near furniture and encourage him to pull himself up. Make sure that your furniture is sturdy and won’t fall over.</li>
	<li>Encourage your baby to squat from standing. Place some toys on the ground in front of your standing baby so she has to squat to pick them up.</li>
	<li>If your baby can stand with support, try push-and-pull toys like block wagons. If the wagon goes too fast, put some heavy books or a bag of rice in it to slow it down.</li>
	<li>Make tunnels out of chairs or cardboard boxes for your baby to enjoy crawling and moving through.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quiet, gentle activities</strong> are also important, especially for developing your baby’s fine motor skills. For example, picking up small objects or putting pegs into a bucket is good for practising small finger movements. And when your baby spends time just looking at things like colourful books or pictures, it helps him get better at moving his eyes.</p>

<p>Current national and international guidelines recommend that children under two years don’t have screen time other than video-chatting with people they know, like grandparents. </p>

<p>Babies learn how things work and what they can do by practising and making mistakes. It’s normal for babies to sometimes get a few small bumps and bruises when they play. When you make your home safe, your baby can play without hurting herself.</p>

<h2>Baby equipment and movement</h2>

<p>Baby equipment like <strong>highchairs, car seats, strollers, and playpens</strong> are all useful, but they can restrict some of your baby’s movements. You might want to think about using them only when you really need them, and try to avoid seating your baby for long periods.</p>

<p>Baby walkers and baby jumping equipment are not recommended. They can delay walking, crawling and sitting without support. They can also cause injuries if babies move into dangerous areas without supervision, like near the oven, toilet, bath and stairs.</p>",3421,55,"45,46,47,48",59,60,"2441, 2446, 2451, 2456, 2461, 2466, 76, 2426, 2431, 2436",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/play-baby-development/movement-play-babies"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/play-baby-development/movement-play-babies</a></p>",en,published
2071,Talking and play: babies,"From 3 to 18 months, your baby’s speech develops dramatically. Simple, enjoyable interactions and play ideas – like reading and singing – will encourage your baby’s talking and language skills.","<h2>What to expect from baby talking and language</h2>

<p>Babies develop language at different rates – some learn quickly and others might need a bit more time.</p>

<p>As your baby starts to learn about language you might hear him:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cooing, gurgling and babbling</li>
	<li>putting together simple sounds – for example, ‘ba-ba’</li>
	<li>copying words</li>
	<li>communicating ‘no’ with a shake of the head.</li>
</ul>

<p>At 12-18 months, most babies say their <strong>first words</strong>. But at this age, you and other close family members might be the only people who know what these words mean! Even though your baby’s words might not sound quite right yet, she still enjoys babbling happily when you talk. She also likes pointing out familiar objects when you name them.</p>

<p>By birthday number two, your baby has become better at talking but some sounds might still be hard for him to say correctly, like the letter ‘r’. He might say it as ‘w’ instead – for example, it might sound like your child is saying ‘wed’ instead of ‘red’.</p>

<p>Encouraging talking skills is as easy as listening and responding to your baby. Sharing stories, songs, rhymes – even talking about your day – will all help your baby learn and practise language. Sharing these experiences with your baby also helps to build your relationship.</p>

<h2>Baby's home language</h2>

<p>If you speak your heritiage language at home, your baby will have a great start!  Listening to you speak in that language will build a foundation that actually helps her to learn a second language (your country's majority language, for example) later on.  The play ideas below will work just as well in your heritage language and will begin to develop her sense of her cultural identity.</p>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage talking</h2>

<p>The more words children hear, the more words they can learn.</p>

<p>Here are some fun things to do together to encourage baby talking and language:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chat to your baby about the things you’re doing around the house, even if you think they’re boring – for example, ‘Daddy’s vacuuming the carpet to get rid of the dust that makes you sneeze’.</li>
	<li>Repeat your baby’s attempts at words to encourage two-way conversation. For example, if she says ‘mama’ you could say ‘mama’ back to her. You can also repeat and build on your toddler’s words. For example, when baby says, ‘train’, you say, ‘Yes, it’s a big red train’.</li>
	<li>Show interest in your baby’s babbling and talking by looking him in the eye and giving lots of smiles.</li>
	<li>Respond to and talk about your baby’s interests. For example, if your baby starts playing with a toy train, you could say ‘Toot, toot’.</li>
	<li>Read and tell stories with your baby.</li>
	<li>Share songs and nursery rhymes.</li>
	<li>Praise your baby’s efforts to talk. For example, if your baby points to a dog and names it, you could say, ‘Well done for pointing out the dog, Georgie!’</li>
</ul>

<p>Nappy-changing is a great time for some face-to-face conversation with your baby. You could try talking, singing and looking at baby’s face as you change nappies.</p>

<h2>Concerns about baby talking</h2>

<p>If you have concerns about your child’s language development – for example, your baby doesn’t babble or doesn’t seem to hear you or listen when others are talking – it’s a good idea to talk to your family health provider.</p>

The key thing is interacting with your baby.Baby play ideas include playing peekaboo, making noise or music, singing nursery rhymes, reading and talking.","<h2>Baby play: why it’s important</h2>

<p>Play is essential for your baby’s overall development, learning and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Through play, your baby learns about the world around him, as he explores and figures out how things work. For example, when your baby shakes a rattle, it shows him that he can make things happen.</p>

<p>Active play that gets your baby moving strengthens muscles and builds gross motor skills and fine motor skills. And any play that involves looking at each other, talking, singing and reading is great for helping your baby learn about emotions, language and communication.</p>

<p>Playing with your child sends a simple message – you’re important to me. Play strengthens your relationship with your child. And a strong relationship with you is essential to development, because it gives your baby the confidence to keep exploring and learning.</p>

<h2>What to expect from baby play</h2>

<p>Babies enjoy playing with people – touching faces and listening to voices.</p>

<p>Babies love moving their arms and legs and they’ll reach out to touch everything – toys, pets and brothers and sisters! In fact, <strong>play becomes more active</strong> as your baby grows. Your baby might start pulling out drawers, dropping cereal onto the floor, and pushing any button she can find.</p>

<p>Sometimes your baby wants to be in charge when he’s playing and likes you to <strong>follow his lead</strong>. Other times your baby might want to try something on his own. It’s good to encourage your baby to take the lead in play, but you’ll need to take control if play puts him in danger or at risk of injury.</p>

<p>Your baby isn’t aware of danger so dangerous things can look like fun to her. Now’s the time to think about making your home a safer place for a baby on the move.</p>

<h2>Baby play ideas and baby games</h2>

<p>The best toy for your baby is you, and the best baby game is playing with you. This means that <strong>baby play is simple</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are some fun play ideas for you and your baby:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Blow raspberries, poke out your tongue, make faces or try a game of peekaboo. Babies love faces, so these are all good ways to play with your baby.</li>
	<li>Make some noise together. Sing all kinds of songs, both loud and soft, and fast and slow. You can hit pots and pans loudly or shake rattles or bells.</li>
	<li>Make a safe place in your home that encourages movement and play. This lets your baby practise skills like sitting up, crawling, pulling up, cruising and walking.</li>
	<li>Give your baby different things to touch – smooth-skinned apples, rough toy blocks or a cold ice cube. Babies also love touching different parts of your face, and having you touch theirs.</li>
	<li>Sing simple nursery rhymes like ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star’. Your baby will also enjoy hearing nursery rhymes and traditional songs from your own culture and language. Rhymes or songs that involve actions or touch are particularly enjoyable for babies.</li>
	<li>Have a ‘conversation’ with your baby. Talk or make other sounds, and wait for him to respond – your baby might surprise you with how much he has to say!</li>
	<li>Read with your baby. Reading together can be a special time with your baby, even if your baby wants to read the same story over and over again. Hearing the same story many times is a way for your baby to learn about language.</li>
</ul>

<p>Play is about having fun. Your baby will use special baby cues to tell you whether she wants to keep playing or when she’s tired and wants quiet time.</p>

It’s great fun too!Encourage your child to play outside several times a day.Outdoor play ideas include tummy time, ball play, nature walks, bike rides and more.","<h2>Why outdoor play is important</h2>

<p>Playing outside gives your child the chance to explore the natural environment and have adventures. She can play games, test her physical limits, express herself and build her self-confidence.</p>

<p>Outdoor play can also mean more mess – and more mess often means more fun!</p>

<p>When your child is outside, he probably has more space and freedom for big movements, like running, jumping, kicking and throwing. Physical activities like these are good for your child’s health, fitness and physical development.</p>

<p>Spending time outdoors might lower your child’s chances of developing short-sightedness. And a bit of safe play in the sun can be good too – small amounts of sunlight exposure can help boost vitamin D levels.</p>

<h2>Getting your child into outdoor play: ideas</h2>

<p>It’s a good idea to encourage your child to <strong>play outside several times a day</strong>.</p>

<p>Outdoor play doesn’t have to be a big deal, particularly if you have an outdoor space at your home. Especially with older children, sometimes all you need to do is send them out the door and<strong> let them come up with their own games.</strong> When younger children are playing outside, though, they need your help to stay safe around outdoor hazards.</p>

<p>Many younger children love to ‘help’. This means that outdoor play can include <strong>working with your child on everyday tasks </strong>like weeding, sweeping the driveway, watering vegetables or hanging clothes on the line.</p>

<p>Making time to <strong>visit your local park, oval or playground</strong> is a low-cost and easy option, especially if you don’t have a yard. Your child will probably have even more room to run around there and might meet other children.</p>

<p>If you can walk to the park, you can also teach your child about road and pedestrian safety on the way. Even younger children can get out of the stroller and walk for a little while. Walking together shows that you value and enjoy outdoor activity too. Other outdoor, active transport activities include riding bikes or scooters.</p>

<p>As your child gets older, you could encourage her to try a structured outdoor activity like junior sport.</p>

<h2>Outdoor play for different ages</h2>

<p>Outdoor play helps <strong>your baby</strong> learn about different surroundings and can make him feel more comfortable with the world around him. Some ideas for outdoor play with your baby include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>enjoying tummy time on a blanket, towel or picnic rug</li>
	<li>crawling on grass, under outdoor furniture or through old boxes</li>
	<li>watching tree leaves and branches move and listening to birds</li>
	<li>looking at different coloured cars, street signs or traffic light signals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toddlers</strong> are keen to explore the world around them and test out their growing physical skills. Outdoor play for your toddler might include:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>throwing and chasing balls</li>
	<li>wheeling, pushing or pulling different toys and objects</li>
	<li>walking, running or jumping around trees, over stones or cracks in the footpath, into puddles or towards favourite objects</li>
	<li>blowing bubbles and chasing them as they float away</li>
	<li>playing in sand, mud or small amounts of water – but always supervise water play to prevent drowning accidents.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preschoolers</strong> are learning to play with other children. They also like make-believe. You can help your child make the most of this stage with outdoor play ideas like:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>playing games of chasey, hide-and-seek or kick-to-kick</li>
	<li>crawling through tunnels or climbing over fallen trees</li>
	<li>moving in different ways with colourful leaves, flowers, scarves or streamers</li>
	<li>making mud pies with dirt and old cooking utensils</li>
	<li>going on a nature walk together and naming all of the different sounds you hear</li>
	<li>building a cubbyhouse out of boxes, clothes baskets or outdoor play equipment or furniture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your <strong>school-age child</strong> is becoming more involved in structured play, like sport, but it’s still important to make time for free play outside. At this age, children still enjoy:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>building and creating with equipment, furniture or other things they find outside</li>
	<li>playing tiggy, chasey or tag</li>
	<li>climbing trees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wet or wintry weather doesn’t mean you and your child have to stay inside – in fact, it can fire up your child’s imagination and creativity. You could try walking with an umbrella and raincoat, watching leaves float after rain, and jumping into or over puddles in gumboots.</p>

<h2>Bumps and bruises when playing outside</h2>

<p>It’s natural to worry that your child could hurt herself when playing outside. Sometimes your child might be worried about trying something new. This is all a normal part of outdoor play, and these worries shouldn’t keep your child from playing outside.</p>

<p>It’s OK for your child to push the play boundaries outside, where he has room to run faster, climb higher and jump further.</p>

<p>It might mean some tears, a scrape or a fall, but ‘risky play’ helps your child learn from mistakes and bounce back.</p>

<p>Children who have been kept away from these outdoor experiences are more likely to get seriously hurt when they have outdoor experiences.</p>",4736,55,"47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"4316, 4321, 4326, 4331",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/play/outdoor-play"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/play/outdoor-play</a></p>",en,published

As preschoolers reach school age, look for words in catalogs, billboards, signs and food items. Encourage your child to try writing words. And keep on reading!","<ul>
</ul>

<h2>About literacy activities</h2>

<p>Talking, singing, playing sound and word games, reading, writing and drawing with your child are great ways to set up a good literacy foundation.</p>

<p>The great news is that <strong>everyday activities</strong>, at home and--when possible--in local shops or library, all offer lots of fun opportunities for literacy development.</p>

<p>And <strong>you don’t need lots of time for literacy activities</strong> – five minutes a few times a day is often enough. The key is to use different times and opportunities to help your child learn. It can be as simple as writing a shopping list, playing a rhyming game or reading a story before bed.</p>

<p>It’s never too early to start getting your child involved with literacy activities – even babies enjoy listening to stories and being part of conversations.  Here are activities for different ages.  If you have several young children of different ages, you can combine or adapt activities to fit their interests and skills.</p>

<h2>Babies, toddlers and preschoolers: literacy activities</h2>

<p><strong>Talking and singing activities</strong><br />
Talking and singing with young children helps them to develop listening and speaking skills. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use rhyme whenever you can. Use phrases like ‘snug as a bug in a rug’ or make up nonsense rhymes about things you’re doing – for example, ‘putting fish in the cat’s dish’.</li>
	<li>Sing traditional nursery rhymes with your child. Nursery rhymes teach your child language, rhyme, repetition and rhythm.  Think about what you heard as a child--in the majority language or your heritage language. </li>
	<li>For babies, repeat sounds your child makes, or make up sounds and see whether your child can copy them. For example, ‘Cows say moo. Can you say moo?’</li>
	<li>At mealtimes, talk about the food you’re preparing, what you’re doing to it, how it tastes and what it looks like. </li>
	<li>Talk about objects outside the house – for example, the rustling of leaves, or the sounds of the birds or traffic. Ask your child if she can make the sounds for wind, rain, water, airplanes, trains and cars.</li>
	<li>Play games like ‘I spy’ using colours. This can be lots of fun, especially for preschoolers. For example, ‘I spy with my little eye, something that’s green. What’s something green I might be looking at?’.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reading and book-based activities</strong><br />
Even with babies, reading aloud develops their vocabulary, ability to listen and understand, and the beginning of an ability to connect sound and words. Your child might like these activities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try books with rhyme, rhythm and repetition.</li>
	<li>With preschoolers, encourage your child to turn the pages and talk about what he sees. Sometimes use your finger to guide your child’s eyes from left to right across the page as you read, and point out certain words or phrases--make sure it is fun.</li>
	<li>Especially for toddlers, choose lift-the-flap books or touch-and-feel books to appeal to their need to feel and explore. You could even make your own book with objects your child likes to look at and touch.</li>
	<li>Use ""interactive story reading.""  Ask conversation-starting questions like ""What do you think will happen next?"" or ""Do you remember when we rode on the bus?"" </li>
	<li>Link books with real life. For example, if you’ve read a book about playing under a tree, you might take your child to sit under a tree in your yard and point out leaves, branches, etc. like the ones in the book.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to act out the story that you’re reading. For example, you can ask your child to hop like the kangaroo in the book.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drawing and writing literacy activities</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Scribbling and drawing help young children develop skills they'll need later in childhood for writing with pencils and pens. Here are some activities to try with toddlers and preschoolers:</p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Encourage your child to draw and write using pens, pencils, crayons and markers. She’ll probably be excited to add a scribble or drawing on birthday cards or letters in a big swirl of colour.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to try some letters or write his name on all the artwork he creates. You can write out letters in one colour and ask your child to trace them in another colour.</li>
	<li>Help your child use playdough to make the letters of the alphabet or numbers.</li>
	<li>Give your child opportunities to use letters of the alphabet in different forms – on blocks, magnetic letters that stick on the fridge, and puzzle pieces.</li>
	<li>Cut out or draw pictures of basic household items – chair, table, TV, wall, door and so on – then write the items’ names on separate pieces of paper. Ask your child to match the name of the item to the picture.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to tell you about her drawings and help your child write down the words she uses to describe them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Older preschool children: Additional literacy activities</h2>

<p>Besides the activities just listed, as your child gets closer to school age, and when she's interested, you could try some of these activities also:</p>

<p><strong>Talking activities</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Play word games that encourage your child to learn sounds. For example, ‘I spy with my little eye something beginning with f-f-f. What do you think I’m looking at that starts with that sound?’.</li>
	<li>Ask your child about words that rhyme. For example, ‘What other words sound like car?’</li>
	<li>Ask your child to make a sound or sound combination, then think of words with that sound. For example, ‘What’s a funny sound? Mo? What sounds can you make with mo? Moan, mope, moat … ’.</li>
	<li>Talk about the past. Ask your child to tell you something he enjoyed doing at child care or preschool that week.  Sometimes you could write it down.</li>
	<li>Talk about the future. Tell your child what you’re going to do on the next day or on the weekend, or ask her to tell you what she needs to do before she goes to bed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reading and book-based activities</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Read stories and then talk about them. Ask, ‘What was that story about?’ or ‘Did you like that character? Why?’</li>
	<li>Older children love alphabet books – ask your child to tell you words that start with the same sound as the letter you’re looking at.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to make a storybook with his own pictures. With your help, he can do this on a computer or with pens and paper. If he's interested, help him write at least some of the letters in the story.</li>
	<li>If you are out walking, ask your child to pick out or sound out letters or words on billboards, shop fronts, street signs or items at the supermarket.  You can do the same thing at home with catalogs and advertising flyers.</li>
	<li>If you are able to visit your library with your child, encourage her to choose books to take home.  Many libraries also have story sessions and book clubs for children.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drawing and writing literacy activities</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Encourage your child to write his name and the names of other family members in greeting cards or on pictures. Once your child can use all the letters well, he’ll be ready for upper case and lower case (capitals and small letters).</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to write pretend shopping lists or restaurant menus for pretend play. </li>
	<li>Ask your child to make you a book, with a word on one side of the page, and a picture of that word on the other side.  With all of these, help as needed and make these enjoyable activities.</li>

Babies enjoy books with good rhyme, rhythm and repetition. Your baby might also like board books and textured books. See suggestions below.","<h2>Why reading with your 12-18-month-old baby is important</h2>

<p>Sharing stories, talking and singing every day <strong>helps your baby’s development in lots of ways</strong>.</p>

<p>You can start reading to your baby as early as you like – the earlier the better. Our articles on reading stories with babies and children and developing literacy have more information to get you and your baby started.</p>

<h2>Sharing books with your young toddler</h2>

<p>From 12-18 months, your baby is at an important time for developing language.  Her ability to say and understand words is growing so quickly.  These suggestions will help you and your baby have fun with books, storytelling, talking and singing and spend special time together.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>tips to help you and your baby</strong> make the most of reading time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Share a ‘goodnight’ book or family story after dinner or at bedtime every night.</li>
	<li>Let your child choose a book and get him to hold it and help turn the pages.</li>
	<li>Use the rhythm of the book’s words to bounce your child on your knee, or pat her on the back in time to the rhythm.</li>
	<li>Build on your child’s love for a favourite book by offering to read it regularly, as well as new or different books.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are <strong>some general tips</strong> for reading with most young children, whatever their age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make a routine, and try to share at least one book every day. The routine could include a special reading space – for example, a chair that’s big and comfortable enough for you and your child, with a box of books or bookshelf nearby.</li>
	<li>Turn off your devices and find a quiet space to read so your child can hear your voice and focus on the book.</li>
	<li>Hold your child close or on your knee while you read, so she can see your face and the book.</li>
	<li>Slow down to give your child time to look at the pictures.</li>
	<li>Try out funny noises and sounds, and use different voices for different characters – play and have fun!</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to read with your 12-18-month-old baby</h2>

<p>In general, young children often enjoy books that have <strong>good rhyme, rhythm and repetition</strong> – and this rhyming and repetition helps them learn. Also, your baby’s interests will guide you when you’re choosing new books. Your baby learns best when he’s interested in what you’re reading together.</p>

<p>Once your baby is <strong>about 12 months old</strong>, you could start looking for the following kinds of books--but follow your child's own interests:</p>

<ul>
	<li>books about food, transport, animals and other babies and toddlers</li>
	<li>board books, which are easier to handle and very sturdy</li>
	<li>books that have pictures or illustrations of simple objects</li>
	<li>books that include textures like fabric or collage in the illustrations.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it's possible with coronavirus restrictions, visit your local library.  There may be books to borrow that are free and perfect for your young toddler.</p>",3426,55,"48,49",59,60,"246, 4161, 4166, 4171, 4176, 4181, 4186, 4191, 4196, 4201, 4206, 4211, 4216, 4221, 4226, 4231",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/literacy-reading-stories/reading-12-18-months"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/play-learning/literacy-reading-stories/reading-12-18-months</a></p>",en,published
2136,Emotions and play: toddlers,"Along with empathy and pride, children start feeling frustrated when they reach the toddler years. In fact, frustration is an emotion you’ll probably see a lot of at this age!","<h2>Toddler emotions and play</h2>

<p>Toddlers are <strong>little people with big feelings</strong> that they don’t always have the words for.</p>

<p>That’s where you come in. Because <strong>play is the natural way children learn and develop</strong>, playing with your toddler gives him a chance to express his feelings and practise managing them.</p>

<p>You can also help your toddler recognise what she’s feeling and why. For example, if she’s sad because her toy is broken, you can name that feeling for her by saying something like ‘I can see you’re sad that your toy is broken. It’s OK – we can fix it’.</p>

<p>Toddlers watch how you express your feelings, and you can set a good example when you manage your feelings well. For example, you send a powerful message when you respond to your frustrated toddler with calmness and understanding.</p>

<h2>What to expect from toddler emotions</h2>

<p>Your toddler will probably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>become more aware of being an individual at 1-2 years</li>
	<li>start to feel fear, embarrassment, empathy and envy around 1-2 years</li>
	<li>begin to be more independent and want to do things without your help</li>
	<li>be able to wait his turn and control some emotions at 1-2 years</li>
	<li>start to say how he feels – for example, he might say ‘ow’ for pain or ‘I did it!’ for pride at 1-2 years</li>
	<li>start to compare his behaviour with other children’s – for example, he might tell you that he waited his turn but others didn't.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your toddler is also learning about a big new emotion – <strong>frustration</strong>. Your child is likely to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>get frustrated and cry, yell or hit out when she doesn’t get her way</li>
	<li>not understand why she can’t have what she wants, when she wants it</li>
	<li>be quite bossy about what she does want</li>
	<li>find it hard to wait for things or stop playing</li>
	<li>struggle to keep her frustration under control sometimes – you might see some tantrums.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the age of <strong>three years</strong>, most toddlers start to feel emotions like guilt and shame. Your toddler needs lots of reassurance and support from you to help him understand these new feelings.</p>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage toddlers to express, understand, and manage emotions</h2>

<p>Play is one of the best ways for young children to practise expressing, understanding, and managing their feelings--although as you know, it's still a big challenge for them. Great ways to encourage this include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>playing and sharing with children of all ages, if this is possible.  If not, you can be a playmate!</li>
	<li>imaginative play with puppets, toys or old clothes – for example, your child could pretend to care for a baby doll or bravely rescue toys from a tree</li>
	<li>singing and dancing – play happy music, music that feels a bit sad--move with your child the way the music makes you feel.</li>
	<li>messy play with sand, playdough, or paint – your toddler can happily slap sand, smoosh a big pile of playdough,  or make big angry paint strokes if she wants to.  Releases tension and is calming for many children.</li>
	<li>water play, at bathtime or just in a pan outdoors, is always relaxing.</li>
	<li>reading stories with characters who are experiencing feelings that your toddler is also going through.  Is the child in the story mad?  Why?  What is she doing?  Pause and talk about the pictures and story.</li>
	<li>outdoor play in an open space where your toddler can run, tumble or roll around to let out her emotions.</li>

It’s a great way for toddlers to learn.Play ideas to develop toddler imagination include reading, drawing, dress-ups, nature walks, treasure boxes, messy play and more.","<h2>Toddler play: why it’s important for imaginative and creative development</h2>

<p>Toddlers are at an age when their imagination and creativity burst forth!  Play is so important in this development.   Imagination and creativity help your toddler to: </p>

<ul>
	<li>explore the world and their place in it</li>
	<li>better understand themselves and other people</li>
	<li>explore and express feelings</li>
	<li>test out different ideas and ways of solving problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to expect as your toddler’s imagination develops</h2>

<p><strong>Dressing up and pretend play </strong>start at around 15-18 months. Your toddler will enjoy pretending to be a grown-up, using props like old clothes and hats. For example, she might imagine she’s driving a bus or serving in a shop.</p>

<p>Your toddler learns by <strong>copying what others do</strong> – For example, by the time your toddler is two years old, he might pretend to cook dinner using leaves and grass he’s found in the backyard.</p>

<p>At the same time, your toddler may also start creating her own <strong>pretend play stories and games</strong>. These might be from books you’ve read together or experiences she’s had, like going to the doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Music</strong> of all sorts can have your toddler imagining fantastic things like flying like a bird. And he’ll express himself by singing, dancing and moving to his favourite songs and rhymes.</p>

<p>At this age, your toddler will probably also enjoy <strong>messy play</strong>. Digging sand or squeezing playdough may be popular activities.</p>

<p>Your toddler will probably enjoy <strong>playing and splashing in the bath</strong> too. She might test what her toys can do by pouring water from one to another, or dunking them underwater. Remember to always supervise your child around water. Toddlers are naturally curious and often fearless, so they’re at particular risk of drowning.</p>

<p>You’ll see your child expressing his imagination and ideas in all kinds of creative ways.</p>

<h2>Play ideas and creative activities to encourage toddler imagination</h2>

<p>It’s good to let your child come up with her own ideas for play. This gives your child a great opportunity to use her imagination.</p>

<p>You can try the following <strong>inside play ideas</strong> to encourage your toddler to put her imagination into action:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Read books and tell stories together about wonderful places and creatures. Talk about the stories with your toddler or ask him what he thinks might happen next.</li>
	<li>Sing nursery rhymes that you remember from your childhood.  Remember, if you have a home language different than your country's majority language, it's wonderful to use this with your toddler.  </li>
	<li>Make some sounds and rhythms with homemade or bought musical instruments.</li>
	<li>Draw and scribble with crayons and paper and let your toddler draw from his imagination.  It doesn't matter what it looks like!</li>
	<li>Visit and explore favourite or new places in your home, like the saucepan drawer or a cupboard.</li>
	<li>Set up a special play space in your home. This can be as simple as draping a cloth over two chairs or cutting an opening into the side of a large cardboard box. Add some dress-up clothes or a pile of blocks to encourage your toddler to come up with stories and games.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even if you are restricted in where you can go in your community, there are many <strong>outdoor play ideas</strong> to stimulate your toddler’s imagination:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Go for a nature walk, even if it is just in your own yard– anywhere with interesting sights and sounds to inspire your toddler.</li>
	<li>Look up! Describe the different things you see in the sky – the moon, stars and clouds are fascinating to your toddler.</li>
	<li>Make a treasure box for your toddler, full of natural objects for your toddler to touch, feel and use. You could include objects like small leaves, colored stones, or seed pods.  Just watch for todders' putting things in their mouths!</li>
	<li>Try messy play using sand, playdough or paints. Just make sure these materials are non-toxic, because your toddler's fingers are likely to end up in her mouth at some stage.</li>
	<li>Set up water play. A bucket of water with a few plastic cups are all your toddler needs.  Bubbles may be fun for a change.  Always supervise your toddler for safe fun with water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Toddler screen time and imaginative play</h2>

<p>Current national and international guidelines recommend that children under two years shouldn’t have screen time other than video-chatting with people they know, and preschoolers should have very limited screen time with quality materials. This is because very young children learn and grow best through real-world experiences like physical play, playing outside, creative play and social time with family and friends--this is how their imagination blossoms.</p>",3376,55,"50,51,52",59,60,"76, 2426, 2431, 2436, 2586, 2591, 2596, 4241, 4246, 4251",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/play-learning/play-toddler-development/imagining-play-toddlers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/play-learning/play-toddler-development/imagining-play-toddlers</a></p>",en,published
2146,Movement and play: toddlers,"Play is good for toddler movement and motor skills development.Toddlers are naturally active, especially as they get better at climbing, running and jumping.Play ideas for toddler movement include music play, riding toys, outdoor play and more.  Adaptations can help all toddlers, including those with disabilities, be active.","<h2>Toddler play: why it’s important for movement and motor skills development</h2>

<p>Play is one of the main ways that children learn, develop and grow. Play is good for all areas of your toddler’s development, including her physical development.</p>

<p>Playing with your toddler each day helps him move about and strengthens his muscles and bones. It’s also good for your toddler’s confidence, as he tests his abilities and discovers that he can climb higher, run faster and jump further all the time.</p>

<p>And when your toddler gets lots of physical activity into her day through play, it’s good for her overall health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Toddlers need hours of active play every day--but this can include quiet physical play-- for example, building with blocks on the floor – as well as walking, running, jumping and climbing on play equipment.  And for toddlers with physical disabilities, your health provider and specialists can help you think how to adapt suggestions to create many ways for your child to use her body and strengthen her motor skills. </p>

<h2>What to expect: toddlers and movement</h2>

<p>At this age, your toddler will probably be able to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>pick up small pieces of food between his pointer finger and thumb</li>
	<li>hold a pencil in a basic writing position at 2-3 years</li>
	<li>walk up and down stairs using alternate feet at 2-3 years – but he’ll probably still need to hold a handrail or an adult’s hand</li>
	<li>throw a ball without falling over</li>
</ul>

<p>Your toddler is becoming more coordinated and is better at <strong>doing simple things for himself</strong>. For example, toddlers can start dressing independently, eating independently with a spoon and fork, and drinking from a cup. By three years they can manage toilet training.</p>

<p>Your child will probably want to test physical limits, climbing as high and running as far as possible – small bumps and falls are common. Supervise, but understand that this is a normal part of how children learn and develop.</p>

<p>If your child isn’t running smoothly by three years, or shows little interest in exploring actively, it’s a good idea to talk with your family health provider.</p>

<h2>Movement and play ideas for toddlers</h2>

<p>Here are some play ideas to get your toddler moving in different ways:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Listen to music that gets your toddler moving to the beat. Add some simple props – like ribbons or homemade shakers – to encourage her to shake, sway or twirl. You can sing simple songs and rhymes with actions for your toddler to copy.  If you use a heritage language at home, this is a great chance to teach words through physically active play.</li>
	<li>If you have access to ride-on toys, try these from 12 months.  If not, it is fun even to push a cardboard box across the room.</li>
	<li>If you have access to scooters or tricycles, your child may enjoy these from 2-3 years. You can try this even earlier if your toddler shows he’s interested.</li>
	<li>Give your toddler different-sized containers so she can put the small ones into larger ones – this helps her practise skills with hand, eye, and brain coordination.</li>
	<li>Do puzzles and Duplo together.</li>
	<li>Go for outdoor play anywhere your toddler can safely walk, run and explore. If you cannot get out, even your own yard or porch gives him the chance to practise gross motor skills on different kinds of surfaces.</li>
	<li>If playgrounds are open, let your toddler use simple playground equipment. It’s a good idea to supervise your child to help her avoid injury, and teach her how to climb safely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screen time and physical play</h2>

<p>Current guidelines recommend that children under two years shouldn’t have screen time other than video-chatting with people they know. This is because very young children learn and grow best through real-world experiences like physical play, playing outside, creative play and social time with family and friends.  After two years, preschoolers should still have very limited involvement with screens.  Let's move!</p>

2151,Collage: activity for children 2-6 years,"Collage is pasting things like leaves or photographs onto paper.Collage is great for developing imagination, fine motor skills, and awareness of colour and texture. For collage, you need paper, glue or paste, scissors, and anything that will stick!","<h2>Collage: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Collage is a simple craft activity that involves pasting items like leaves or photographs onto a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>Making a collage helps your child use her hands and fingers to develop fine motor skills. It’s also a fun way to encourage your child’s awareness of colour and texture and to stimulate imagination. And if you talk with your child about his collage, it helps his language development too.</p>

<h2>What you need for collage</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Paper</li>
	<li>Glue or paste</li>
	<li>Scissors (small, child-safe scissors--or youngest children can tear paper)</li>
	<li>A collection of collage items</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Collage items</strong> are anything that will stick to your paper! You could try:</p>

<ul>
	<li>pictures cut out of magazines or catalogues</li>
	<li>scraps of paper of different colors (some can be pages from catalogs or magazines), ribbon or fabric cut into small pieces</li>
	<li>foil, bumpy cardboard from boxes, pieces of paper towels.</li>
	<li>natural objects like leaves, feathers and small sticks</li>
	<li>pipe-cleaners, paperclips, ice-cream sticks or buttons (watch the youngest children as they may still put objects in their mouths).</li>
</ul>

<p>You could take a box and keep it filled with materials for collage and other possible craft activities? Just make sure that your ‘busy bits’ are safe – again, watch out for choking  and other hazards.  Keep the box on a special shelf for rainy-day activities or other times when your child complains ""there's nothing to do.</p>

<h2>How to do collage:  There is no one right way!</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Work at a table</strong>, and keep the collage items in plastic tubs or on a tray. This can help you keep any mess under control.  A plastic sheet under the table may help if your child often drops things.</li>
	<li><strong>Follow your child’s lead.</strong> There is no right way to do collage.  <strong>Toddlers</strong> will love just tearing and pasting.  Let them!  They may stay with it for a long time, or finish quickly.  That's fine.  Your <strong>older preschooler </strong>might want to make a picture with the collage – sticking down leaves and cut-out brown paper to make a forest, for example. Let your child choose, and admire the effort. Talk with your child as he creates.   You can say things like ""You're using so many pieces of cloth.  Can you tell me what you're doing?""  or ""I see that you are thinking hard about what to do next.  Did you look at these leaves?""</li>
	<li><strong>If possible, sit with your child while he creates.</strong>  Even if you're busy, stay nearby and notice your child's creations.  Just your presence shows that you value her work.  You might have a special place in your home to hang up collages and other creative efforts.  If coronavirus restrictions have limited your time with grandparents or other family, you might be able to show and talk about the finished collage in a video chat.</li>

<p>Cubbyhouses are a great way for children to enjoy imaginative play and role play. For example, a simple cubbyhouse can turn into all sorts of places – a shop, hospital, school, castle and much more.</p>

<p>Also, making or building a simple cubbyhouse encourages children to think creatively and solve problems.</p>

<p>And a cubbyhouse can be a safe place for children to spend quiet time alone with their thoughts.</p>

<h2>What you need to make a cubbyhouse</h2>

<p>You can build a cubbyhouse using things around your home. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build a tent using chairs placed back to back, 1-2 metres apart, with a sheet or blanket hung over the top. You can use pillows to hold the edges to the floor so the cubbyhouse doesn’t collapse.</li>
	<li>Hang a blanket over a table.</li>
	<li>Tie a rope between two very stable objects, with a sheet draped over the rope, to make a tent. You can set up this type of cubbyhouse between two trees or across the corner of a balcony that’s safe for your child to play on.</li>
	<li>Use a big cardboard box with holes cut out for doors and windows. Your child can paint or decorate it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re using ropes and furniture to make a cubbyhouse, be aware of strangulation and suffocation risks, as well as the risk of furniture toppling over.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Decide what sort of cubbyhouse to make and then build it with your child. Be led by your child’s ideas. For example, ask your child where to put the cubbyhouse. Or if you’re cutting out windows from a cardboard box, see whether your child can mark where they want the windows.</li>
	<li>When the cubbyhouse is ready, encourage your child to set it up the way they want it. Your child might like to bring some pillows, toys and books into the cubbyhouse.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to make the cubbyhouse into an imaginary place, like a fort, ship, office and so on. You could help your child to find supplies and equipment from the toy box or the kitchen.</li>
	<li>Have fun together. A cubbyhouse is a good place for having imaginary adventures or sharing a quiet story.</li>
	<li>Give your child time to play in the cubbyhouse alone, if that’s what they want. Some children really enjoy having a special private space that’s just for them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some children might be more interested in playing with the cubbyhouse than building it, and that’s OK.</p>

<h2>Adapting cubbyhouse play for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Your younger child might enjoy crawling in and out of the cubbyhouse and peeking out at everybody. It’s best to follow your child’s lead and enjoy the play.</p>

<p>Your older child might want something more complicated than a simple sheet over a table. Your child can also take an active role in designing and constructing the cubbyhouse. For example, you could work together to join a few large boxes.</p>",4716,55,"51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/cubbyhouse-activity"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/cubbyhouse-activity</a></p>",en,published
2161,Guess the animal game: activity for children 1-6 years,"Playing a guess the animal game gets children using imagination and thinking skills.If you move like the animal you’re pretending to be, this game can be good exercise too.You can play this game anywhere.","<h2>Guess the animal game: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>This game involves guessing what animal the other person is pretending to be.</p>

<p>Playing this guess the animal game gets children using their imaginations. It also encourages thinking skills as children try to work out what animal you’re pretending to be. It’s good exercise too, as you hop, crawl, or wriggle around.</p>

<p>And it’s a fun way to connect with children.</p>

<h2>What you need to play guess the animal</h2>

<p>You can play this game anywhere, but an open space like your own yard, a porch, or (if you can) a park will give you lots of room to move. Books with pictures of animals can spark ideas for your child.</p>

<h2>How to play guess the animal</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Ask your child to choose an animal.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to think about the way the animal moves. Look at pictures in a book together, if your child isn’t sure. </li>
	<li>Encourage your child to move like the animal they’ve chosen.</li>
	<li>Try and guess what the animal is.</li>
	<li>Take turns to move like different animals. You could crawl like a spider, hop like a rabbit, slither like a snake, or gallop like a horse.</li>
	<li>Ask each other questions to help you guess. For example, ‘What noise does it make?’, ‘What does it eat?’, ‘Is it fast or slow?’, ‘Is it little or big?’ or ‘Do I like it?’</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adapting a guess the animal game for children of different ages</h2>

<p><strong>For younger children, </strong>you might begin by pretending to be an animal yoursef.  Make it easy--a dog or cat or bird?  Then help her choose--the same animal or a different one.  If your <strong>younger child</strong> doesn’t want to stop pretending to be the animal when it’s your turn, that’s OK. Just follow your child’s lead, and join in.</p>

<p>Your <strong>older child</strong> might enjoy trying to ‘trick’ you with obscure or very specific animals, like an armadillo or a jaguar. If the game is going on too long, you can try setting a limit on the number of questions you can ask before the other person has to tell you the answer.</p>",3981,55,"49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"4831, 226",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/guess-the-animal-game"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/guess-the-animal-game</a></p>",en,published
2166,Costume games: activity for children 3-6 years,"Costume games let your child play different roles, explore ideas and develop imagination. Old clothes, accessories and simple props are great for costume games. Let your child take the lead with costumes but join in if she/he asks you to.","<h1><strong>Costume games: why they’re good for children</strong></h1>

<p>From around the age of three years, your child might enjoy costume games.</p>

<p>Costume games let your child act out different roles, explore ideas about the real world and develop her/his imagination. For example, she/he might choose to be a pirate stomping around and scaring people, or a doctor giving her/him teddy a check-up.</p>

<p>Costume games and pretend play also allow your child to explore and express emotions in a safe way. For example, your preschooler could pretend to be kind like a teacher or brave like a police officer.</p>

<h2><strong>What you need for children’s dress-up games</strong></h2>

<p>Collect a box of clothes and other things your child can use for dress-up games. Your collection might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>old clothes, especially fun and colourful clothes</li>
	<li>shoes and boots – especially shoes that let your child walk differently, like platforms or heavy boots</li>
	<li>hats, belts, handbags and jewellery</li>
	<li>pieces of fabric and scarves – these make great capes, turbans, veils and shawls</li>
	<li>simple dress-up props – you can buy these from a bargain store or make your own.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to play costume games with your child</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Step back and let your child take the lead. Avoid telling your child what she/he should be or wear. Creating an outfit and a character is part of the fun for your child. For example, she/he might use her/his imagination to create a superhero outfit from a towel and swimmers.</li>
	<li>Get into the moment with your child by asking her/him if you can play too. Follow her/his lead. If she/he wants to be a doctor, maybe you can be a patient. Extend the game by asking questions and inventing new scenarios. For example, ‘You’re bandaging my broken arm? Will that fix it? Ow! It still hurts. What else can you do?’</li>
	<li>Give your child a mirror so she/he can see herself/himself dressed up as another character. She/He might enjoy doing different poses or pulling faces. For example, she/he could be a scary monster or a silly clown.</li>
	<li>Sometimes your child might want to dress up and play imaginary games by herself/himself, or with her/his toys. You might hear her/him talking to herself/himself in different voices as she/he plays. It’s OK if she/he doesn’t want you to join in – you can just ask her/him another time.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Adapting costumes for children of different ages</strong></h2>

<p>Your younger child might just enjoy putting on and taking off different things. For example, she/he might want to try on different hats or clothes without getting into a character or an imaginary game. You can still join in – for example, ‘You look like a rodeo rider in that hat. Can I try it on next?’</p>

<p>You can involve your older child in making her/his own costumes. Try a pirate patch made out of a piece of black cardboard and some elastic, or a pair of wings made from an old pair of stockings stretched over some bent coat hangers.</p>

2171,Playing with cardboard boxes: activities for children 2-6 years,Cardboard boxes are great for imaginative play and physical play.Children can have fun with cardboard boxes of any size.  You can also give your child tools and materials to change or decorate boxes.,"<h2>Playing with cardboard boxes: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>A big empty box is <strong>a great starting point for creative and imaginative play</strong>. Children can decide how to change the box into something they can use for pretend play, like a house, shop, cave and so on. Then they can use their imagination and problem-solving skills to turn ideas into reality.</p>

<p>Cardboard boxes can also encourage <strong>physical play</strong>. Often the first thing children want to do with a cardboard box is to climb into it – and perhaps jump out to surprise you!</p>

<h2>What you need for playing with cardboard boxes</h2>

<p>Boxes of any size are fun to play with and will get your child’s imagination working. If you can find a really big cardboard box, your child can fit inside it and create something amazing. You might be able to get cardboard boxes from shops.  Because of Covid 19 restrictions on shopping, many families are ordering items for delivery.  Remember to save those boxes also, even if they are smaller--you and your child might be able to tape some together.</p>

<p>If you r older preschooler wants to be able to change or decorate the box, some of these might be useful:</p>

<ul>
	<li>scissors or a craft knife (adult use only)</li>
	<li>tape and glue</li>
	<li>paints, marker pens or thick crayons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on how your child wants to use the box, your child could also use things like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>colourful paper, foil, cellophane or fabric to decorate the box</li>
	<li>paper plates to use as the wheels of a car, bus, truck or train</li>
	<li>puppets and a bit of fabric for a curtain to make a puppet theatre.</li>
</ul>

<p>Work with your child to make any changes to the box that will make it fun to play in.</p>

<h2>How to play with cardboard boxes</h2>

<p>There’s no ‘right’ way to play with a cardboard box, so <strong>let your child decide what they want to do and follow their lead</strong>.  Depending on the child's age, you could ask:  ""Can you fit inside?  Let's see!"" or ""What can it be? A house? A car?""</p>

<p>If your child needs suggestions to get started, you could <strong>try these ideas</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make a house. Cut open a window and a door and let your child add cushions and other ‘furniture’. Your child could bring in some toys for a tea party.</li>
	<li>Make a plane or a car. Use paper plates for wheels and steering wheels. Cut off the box flaps and stick them back on as the wings and tail of a plane. Let your child draw or paste markings and racing stripes.</li>
	<li>Make a puppet theatre. Cut a doorway and a window on opposite sides of the box. Let your child put on a show for the family from inside the box.</li>
	<li>Decorate the box. Cut holes for your child to stick colourful cellophane over. Let your child draw or paint on it, and stick on paper or scraps of fabric.</li>
	<li>Especially for toddlers, use the box to encourage active play. For example, turn it sideways to make a tunnel. Or your child could be a jack-in-the-box – crouching low inside the box and then jumping up like they’re on a spring.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting cardboard box play for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Let your <strong>younger child</strong> take the lead with cardboard boxes, and keep it simple. Your child can climb in and out, or make scribbles on the box with markers.</p>

<p>Encourage your <strong>older child</strong> to get involved in construction. But help your child to solve problems rather than giving them all the solutions. For example, let your child work out whether glue or sticky tape works best, or which way up the box should be for a puppet show.</p>",4706,55,"51,52,57",59,60,"4831, 4321, 226",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/playing-with-cardboard-boxes"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/playing-with-cardboard-boxes</a></p>",en,published
2176,Reading activities: children 2-4 years,Reading and storytelling help your child’s development in many ways.Start with picture books that have rhyme and rhythm or that are about your child’s interests.Try to share at least one book with your child each day.,"<h2>Reading: why it’s good for children ages 2-4</h2>

<p>Reading and storytelling help your child’s development in many ways. These activities promote brain development and imagination, teach your child about language and emotions, and lay the foundations for literacy. Reading is also a great way for you to  share time together. </p>

<h2>What you need for reading with your child</h2>

<p>Reading with your child is all about having fun with books and spending special time together. All you need is a picture book that you and your child can enjoy together. You don’t need to buy lots of books.  If a local library is open, borrow books there.  Or swap with friends and other family.</p>

<p>Your child might enjoy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>books that have good rhyme, rhythm and repetition</li>
	<li>books about a favourite topic, like cars, fairies, insects or dinosaurs (your child may have other interests)</li>
	<li>pop-up, alphabet, shape, size and counting books</li>
	<li>books that use humour and have a sense of fun – for example, a character who uses a funny word, or who is silly or even ‘naughty’.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to enjoy reading and book time with your child</h2>

<p>Here’s how you and your child can make the most of book time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Help your child choose a book. It’s OK if he chooses the same one over and over. If it’s one you haven’t read together before, look at the cover and ask him what he thinks it might be about.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to hold the book and turn the pages.</li>
	<li>Read the story together.</li>
	<li>Vary the pace of your reading, as well as how loud you read. Changing your voice and expression for different characters can also be fun.</li>
	<li>Chant or sing repetitive phrases and words together.</li>
	<li>Point to things in the pictures and name them, or ask your child to name them--""Oh, what's this animal?  Your grandmother has one!"" Talk about the pictures and ask your child questions – for example, ‘What do you think happens next?’ or ‘Why is the baby happy?’  This is just for fun, not a test!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some general tips for reading with your child</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make a routine, and try to share at least one book every day.</li>
	<li>Be guided by your child’s interest. If your child wants to spend more time reading, that’s great. And if she sometimes wants only one book or story, that’s OK too.</li>
	<li>Turn off the TV or radio so your child can focus.</li>
	<li>Hold your child close or on your knee while you read so he can see your face and the book.</li>
	<li>Use other kinds of books if you cannot get to a library or buy new books.  For example, you can make a book with pictures cut from a magazine or drawn simply, adding words that tell the story.  Or invite your child to tell you a story as you write it down.  You could start by giving the first sentence:  ""One day, X went for a walk with her mother.  First she saw . . ."" (child fills in).</li>

2181,Looking for words: literacy activity for children 2-5 years,"Looking for words is a simple everyday literacy activity. Try it at home, looking for words on signs and labels.  If you are able to take your child for a walk in the neighborhood or grocery shopping, do the activity there.","<h2>Looking for words: why it’s a good literacy activity</h2>

<p>Everyday activities like going to the local shops are fun ways to help your child’s literacy development.  Many of these activities can also happen at home if you are not able to get out of the house often.  These kinds of everyday literacy activities don’t cost extra money or take up extra time.</p>

<p>For example, looking for words is a simple literacy activity.</p>

<h2>What you need for looking for words: literacy activity while shopping or at home</h2>

<p>You don’t need any special equipment. <strong>Just look for the words all around you</strong> and share them with your child.</p>

<h2>How to do looking for words: literacy activity</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If you are planning to buy food, sit with your child while you write a shopping list. If he’s old enough, he can write a list too. Or he can pretend to write a list by scribbling on paper.</li>
	<li>Talk about what you plan to buy, including any foods your child likes. For example, ‘Let’s put milk on the list. Milk starts with an “m”. M-ilk’.   (You can do this even if you must shop alone)</li>
	<li>If your child is with you at the shops, point out words on shop signs and product labels. Show your child how you use the list so you don’t forget anything. Your child can help by crossing things off the list as you pick them up.</li>
	<li>If you are staying inside at this time, look on your kitchen shelves with your child.  Look at boxes and cans of food and find words to say.  Many packages have pictures that can be clues.  Depending on your child's age, encourage her to identify some words or letters. Ask your child to guess what words mean by looking at the first letter and the picture on a packet. See whether your child can find an item that begins with the first letter of her name.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting this literacy activity for children of different ages</h2>

<p><strong>Your younger child</strong> might not be able to recognise letters, but he can still have fun with words and sounds. For example, you might say ‘B-bananas. We need bananas’. Hold things up for your child to see when you name them, and make sure he watches your face while you’re talking. Encourage him to try to make the sounds or say the words too.</p>

<p><strong>Your older child</strong> will be better at recognising letters and signs. She might even be able to read some. See whether your child can tell you what something is by reading a label. You could look more closely at a label and point out where you can read the ingredients or the country where the product came from.</p>",4701,55,"51,52,57",59,60,"4831, 4926, 2416",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/looking-for-words-literacy-activity"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/looking-for-words-literacy-activity</a></p>",en,published

<p>Visiting a public library with your child is a great way to encourage a love of books and reading.</p>

<p>You can <strong>borrow great children’s books for free</strong> from your local library. Libraries often have audio books, dual-language books, ebooks and magazines too. This means you can have lots of books and things for your child to read – and it won’t cost you anything.</p>

<p>Your child will have fun choosing her own books from the library. Library staff can recommend books for you and your child to enjoy too.</p>

<p>Libraries also offer story times, activities and school holiday programs for children.</p>

<h2>What you need to visit the library</h2>

<p>You just need to <strong>find out where your local library is</strong>! Phone your local council or look at its website.</p>

<p>If you live in a rural, regional or remote part of Australia, you can check whether your council offers a mobile or remote library lending service.</p>

<p>If you have access to more than one local library, you could ask around to find out which library has a good selection of children’s books. Some libraries might be more child friendly than others.</p>

<p>When you join a library, the library staff will tell you how many books your child can borrow and when you have to return them.</p>

<h2>How to make the most of visiting the library</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Talk to your child about the library before you go. For example, ‘It’s a place where we can choose some books to borrow for a while. We take the books back when we’ve finished so someone else can read them. Libraries are quiet places. We can’t run around or shout’.</li>
	<li>Practise using quiet ‘library voices’ at home.</li>
	<li>At the library, go to the children’s section and encourage your child to browse the books. Give her some quiet time to look through the books.</li>
	<li>Notice what books your child is interested in, and talk about the books that he looks at. For example, ‘That looks like an interesting book – what do you think it might be about?’</li>
	<li>Sit with your child and read some books together. Decide together which ones to borrow and which ones you’ll put back on the shelf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Trying different books is all part of learning. It doesn’t matter if some of the books your child chooses turn out to be too hard or aren’t as interesting as she thought they would be. You can just return them and get something else next time.</p>

<h2>Adapting library visits for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Most libraries run story times where a staff member or volunteer chooses a book and reads to a group of younger children. A little bit of noise and talk is usually OK at story time, so these sessions can be good for <strong>younger children</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Older children</strong> might enjoy looking for books in their areas of interest – for example, puppies, ballet or volcanoes. You could show your child how to use the catalogue to search for a topic area or a favourite author.</p>",4696,55,"52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article:<br />

Ask your child to fill in the words in stories she knows, and name what she sees in the pictures.Your toddler might enjoy books with animals, stories about playtime, and lift-the-flap and pop-up books. See book suggestions below.","<h2>Why reading with your toddler is important</h2>

<p>Sharing stories, talking and singing every day <strong>helps your child’s development in lots of ways.</strong></p>

<p>You’re getting your child familiar with sounds, words, language, print and, eventually, the value and joy of books. This all builds your child’s early literacy skills and helps him go on to read successfully later in childhood.</p>

<p>Reading stories also stimulates your child’s imagination and helps her learn about the world around her.</p>

<p>And reading together creates a precious time for bonding with your child.</p>

<p>You can start reading to your child as early as you like – the earlier the better. Our articles on reading and storytelling with children and developing literacy have more information to get you and your child started.</p>

<h2>Sharing books with your toddler</h2>

<p>At this age and stage, reading with your child is all about having fun with books, spending special time together and modelling a love of books.</p>

<p>Here are some tips that can help you and your budding reader make the most of book time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Help your child choose a book, then ask him to hold the book and turn the pages.</li>
	<li>Get your child to fill in the words in a story she knows. Also try pausing and letting her finish sentences for you.</li>
	<li>Ask your toddler to name what he sees in the pictures.</li>
	<li>Talk with your toddler about the sounds animals make.</li>
	<li>Sing nursery rhymes and fun songs together.</li>
</ul>

<p>These <strong>general tips</strong> are helpful for reading and storytelling with most young children:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make a routine, and try to share at least one book every day. The routine could include a special reading space – for example, a chair that’s big and comfortable enough for you and your child, with a box of books or bookshelf nearby.</li>
	<li>Make reading and storytelling relaxed and fun so that your child looks forward to it. There’ll be days when she doesn’t want to spend a long time reading, and that’s OK. Just be guided by her interest.</li>
	<li>Turn off your devices, and find a quiet space to read so your child can focus and listen to your voice.</li>
	<li>Hold your child close or on your knee while you read so he can see your face and the book.</li>
	<li>Involve your child in reading by encouraging talk about the pictures, and by repeating familiar words or passages. Try out funny noises and sounds – play and have fun!</li>
	<li>If she wants to, let your child choose the books. She might have favourite authors and illustrators. Be prepared to read your child’s favourite books over and over again!</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>What to read with your toddler</h2>

<p>There are so many books to choose from that it can be hard to know where to start.</p>

<p>In general, young children often enjoy books that have <strong>good rhyme, rhythm and repetition</strong> – and these qualities can help children learn. Books that are the right length for your child will keep him engaged.</p>

<p>Toddlers might especially enjoy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>books with animals and animal noises</li>
	<li>books about a favourite topic, like cars, trucks, fairies, pets, stars and planets, music, castles, the ocean, princesses or trains.  You know what your child might like.</li>
	<li>books about playtime that relate to their experiences</li>
	<li>pop-up books – at this age, children can have fun with books with moveable pieces.</li>

2211,Talking and play: preschoolers,"By your child’s fourth birthday, his language skills have developed a lot. He enjoys talking and asking questions, even if he makes some mistakes. Here are some play ideas to help preschoolers with talking and language.","<h2>What to expect: preschoolers and talking</h2>

<p>At <strong>3-4 years</strong>, your preschooler will probably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>be able to ask more complex questions and speak with better but not perfect grammar</li>
	<li>say sentences with 5-6 words.</li>
</ul>

<p>By <strong>five years</strong>, your preschooler will probably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>be able to say her name and address</li>
	<li>be able to speak clearly using sentences of up to nine words</li>
	<li>have meaningful conversations and tell you detailed stories.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your preschooler is likely to be keen to talk to you, his friends and other family members as much as possible in these years. It’s really good for your child’s language if you listen and talk with him.</p>

<p>In fact, children at this age often have so much news to share that they sometimes stumble over the words and get frustrated – this is OK. Just give your preschooler time and keep listening. <strong>Your child will get the words out eventually.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re raising children who speak your heritage language at home, you can expect their language development to be similar to preschoolers who speak only one language--and later on, bilingualism can be an advantage! Going to child care or preschool can help bilingual preschoolers get extra practice speaking and listening to the majority language of your country.</p>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage preschoolers with talking</h2>

<p>At this age children still need lots of practice and support to develop speech and language. The more often you talk with or around your preschooler, the more words she’ll learn and use to communicate.</p>

<p>The best way to encourage your child’s language skills is to focus on fun activities like <strong>singing songs or reciting nursery rhymes</strong>, rather than getting pronunciation or grammar right.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to encourage talking through play:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you talk with your child, respond to your child’s interests. If your preschooler is interested in cars passing by, take a moment to talk about them.</li>
	<li>Play with puppets or make-believe with your child.  Children usually talk more when they can pretend to be a character (animal, baby, fire fighter, etc.)--even children who are usually quiet.</li>
	<li>Read aloud together. If the library is open, you could also take your child to story time.</li>
	<li>Tell stories together: your child will enjoy hearing stories. She’ll also like remembering and telling you simple stories. What stories do you remember from your childhood?  Does your culture have traditional stories?  Leaving out words in stories and asking your preschooler to fill in the words is fun too.</li>
	<li>Sing songs together.</li>
	<li>Tell simple jokes and riddles. Preschoolers usually enjoy simple word games like finding rhyming words and even making up words.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Screen time for preschoolers</strong><br />
Children aged 2-5 years should have no more than one hour of screen time a day. Too much screen time can affect language development and limits your child's time in activities that support all areas of her development.</p>

<p>All children develop at different rates. But if you’re concerned about any aspect of your child’s development, including his talking and language development, it’s a good idea to talk with your child’s educator or visit yur family health provider for advice.</p>",3991,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"3781, 3786, 3791, 196, 4256, 4261, 4266, 4271, 4276",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/connecting-communicating/communicating/talking-play-preschoolers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/connecting-communicating/communicating/talking-play-preschoolers</a></p>",en,published
2216,Emotions and play: preschoolers,"Your child is learning to express and manage emotions. This is great news for your child and for you, because it means less frustration and impatience and fewer tantrums.","<h2>Preschoolers, emotions and play</h2>

<p>Preschoolers are learning more about emotions all the time, especially during play.</p>

<p>Play is the natural way children learn and develop. <strong>Play gives preschoolers a chance to express their feelings</strong> and practise managing them.</p>

<h2>What to expect from preschoolers and emotions</h2>

<p>At around <strong>3-4 years </strong>your preschooler will probably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use words to describe basic feelings like sad, happy, angry and excited</li>
	<li>feel sorry and understand she should apologise when she has done something wrong – although you’ll probably need to give plenty of reminders</li>
	<li>feel generous and show that she understands the idea of sharing – but don’t expect her to share all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>4-5 years</strong>, your preschooler will probably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use words to describe more complex feelings like frustration, annoyance and embarrassment, particularly if you’ve been encouraging him to do this</li>
	<li>hide the truth about something if he feels guilty, embarrassed or frightened. He might even say ‘I didn’t do it’ even when he did</li>
	<li>be better at managing strong emotions like anger, frustration and disappointment and have fewer tantrums</li>
	<li>be very attached to you – for example, your child might feel anxious about going somewhere unfamiliar, like a birthday party.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the time she’s <strong>five</strong>, your child will probably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use words to describe complex feelings like disappointment, guilt and jealousy</li>
	<li>be more aware of her feelings towards others and act on them – for example, your child might be kind to friends and family and want to help you more</li>
	<li>try hard to follow the rules to avoid getting in trouble</li>
	<li>have more patience when she’s waiting for things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Play ideas to encourage preschooler emotions</h2>

<p>Playing with you and with other children helps preschoolers explore and understand their feelings. Here are some play tips for you and your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child <strong>opportunities for messy play</strong>, like playing with sand, mud or paints. This is a great way for children to express feelings like happiness or sadness.</li>
	<li>Look for imaginative and creative ways for your child to play. Your child could act out feelings with puppets or toys, or use old clothes for dress-ups and pretend play. For example, your preschooler could pretend to be kind and concerned like a teacher or a doctor.</li>
	<li>Take your child outside to play in a park or open area with lots of space for running, tumbling and rolling. This can help your child let out emotions.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to <strong>paint and draw</strong> as a way of expressing himself. Painting and drawing can soothe and calm your child if he’s frustrated or sad.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to <strong>jump around and ‘act out’ music</strong> or make music with simple instruments.</li>
	<li>Read stories that feature characters who are experiencing similar situations and emotions to your child. This can really help your child understand new emotions like grief about the death of a pet or worry about starting school.</li>
	<li>Give your child chances to <strong>play with children of all ages</strong>. By playing with other children, your child can learn how to recognise, manage and respond to emotions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your child might find it easier to express feelings if she feels in charge. Letting your child choose what and how to play can help with this.</p>

<p>All children develop at their own pace. If you’re concerned about any aspect of your child’s development, it’s a good idea to talk to your child and family health nurse or GP or your child’s preschool teacher.</p>",4786,55,"52,57",59,60,"511, 76, 2426, 2431, 2436",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/play-preschooler-development/emotions-play-preschoolers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/play-preschooler-development/emotions-play-preschoolers</a></p>",en,published

<p>Your child will be happier and cope better with problems if she knows how to recognise and understand her own emotions.   This is a gradual process as children develop.</p>

<p>When your child can recognise, understand and talk about strong emotions like excitement, frustration, anger or disappointment, he’s less likely to express these emotions through challenging behaviour, like tantrums.</p>

<p>Being able to recognise and understand how other people are feeling can help your child get along with others too.</p>

<h2>What you need to help your child learn about emotions</h2>

<p>You can do this activity anywhere and anytime you play with your child. You just need your face!</p>

<h2>How to help your child learn about emotions</h2>

<p>This activity gives your child <strong>practice with naming emotions in a fun, playful way</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose an emotion.  With younger preschoolers, start with basic ones – for example, ""sad,"" and with older i, something like ""frustrated"" or ""excited.""</li>
	<li>Talk with your child about a time you felt that emotion and when she might feel it too – for example, ‘I get excited when it’s my birthday. When do you get excited?’</li>
	<li>Show your child the emotion with your face and body. For example, show your child an excited face, clap your hands, jump up and down, and so on.</li>
	<li>Say the emotion while you show it – for example, ‘I’m feeling excited’.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to show you the same emotion with his face and body.</li>
	<li>You can take turns showing and guessing different emotions and talking about times when you felt those emotions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other ideas for learning about emotions</h2>

<p>If you have been taking about an emotion, see if you and your child can find an examplein a book you are reading.  ""Look at the picture of the boy.  Does he look sad?  Why, do you think?""</p>

<p>Try drawing emotion faces and guessing what they represent.  Your older preschooler can draw with you.</p>

<p>Use favourite puppets or toys to act out emotions and then talk about the emotions the toys are ‘feeling’. For example, a toy might be feeling too scared to play or feeling excited about a party.</p>

<h2>Adapting this emotions activity for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Keep the emotions and emotion words very simple for <strong>your younger child</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Your older child</strong> will be able to understand and learn words for more complex emotions, like ‘confused’ or ‘jealous’. He’ll probably find it easier to connect the names of emotions with his own experiences.</p>",3946,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"4831, 2416, 4921, 156",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/learning-about-emotions"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/learning-about-emotions</a></p>",en,published
2226,"Imagining, creating and play: preschoolers","Play fosters creativity and imagination in preschoolers, which is important for overall development.Preschoolers have vivid imaginations. They often enjoy pretend games, and making art, craft and music.Play ideas to stimulate preschooler imagination include reading, nature walks, busy boxes, dress-ups, puppet play and more.","<h2>Preschooler play: why it’s important for imaginative and creative development</h2>

<p>Play fosters creativity and imagination in preschoolers, and the preschool years can be one of the most creative times in a child’s life.</p>

<p>As their imaginations grow, play gives preschoolers opportunities to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>build confidence</li>
	<li>express feelings and learn communication skills</li>
	<li>develop, practise and improve coordination and motor skills</li>
	<li>practise decision-making, problem-solving and critical thinking</li>
	<li>explore ideas in a safe environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all very important skills for the preschooler years and beyond.</p>

<h2>What to expect as your preschooler’s imagination develops</h2>

<p>From around three years your child might enjoy using puppets and dress-ups, tell you very detailed stories about things that never happened, or have an imaginary friend. She might pretend to be a grown-up, a doctor or an astronaut.</p>

<p>Your preschooler will probably be very keen on any chance to <strong>scribble, draw, paint and paste</strong>. At around four years, your child can draw places, things and people with lots of detail from his imagination.</p>

<p>By five years, your child can express thoughts and ideas through drawing. She might also start to use art to tell stories, show feelings or describe things that she’s seen.</p>

<p>Remember, children at this age <strong>can’t always tell what’s real and what’s made up</strong>. This might mean that any scary monsters from stories become real to your child. If your child has nightmares, reassure him that he’s safe--monsters are only make-believe.</p>

<h2>Play ideas and creative activities for preschoolers</h2>

<p>Allow your child to play in her own way, without your always being involved.  But remember that your child still needs you to encourage and help him if he’s having trouble.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>play ideas </strong>to encourage your child’s imagination:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Tell stories and read books. Your preschooler might enjoy making up new endings for familiar stories. Also try sharing silly rhymes and riddles. Preschoolers especially like word games and enjoy making up their own jokes or rhymes.</li>
	<li>Go for a nature walk or play outside in different kinds of weather. This a simple, low-cost way to let your child experience new and stimulating environments--even if it is just your yard.</li>
	<li>Make time for outdoor play.</li>
	<li>Get your child to help you with simple household chores. She could be a waiter who helps to set the table. Or she might like to pretend that she’s a chef and help you with some basic cooking.</li>
	<li>Set up a special play space within your home. Large cardboard boxes or cloths draped over chairs provide endless possibilities for pretend play. Include plenty of toys like blocks or balls, which allow for open-ended play.</li>
	<li>Take the time to rest and dream. Lie on your backs together and look at the clouds and the sky. Imagine what the various shapes could be.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also make up some simple, low-cost play activities for your child. For example:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Give your child crayons or pencils for drawing and scribbling.</li>
	<li>Make a ‘busy box’ for your child, full of things like coloured papers, string, glue and other used items like pieces of cardboard and plastic bottles. The special box can also include natural items found outdoors like twigs, petals, stones or feathers. Many creative projects will result!</li>
	<li>Collect a box of old clothes, shoes, jumpers, boots, handbags and other things for dress-up games. </li>
	<li>If you have the space, set up a messy play area with playdough, paints, sand, or water.  Outdoors may be best.</li>
	<li>Keep old magazines and catalogues. Your child can cut out pictures of people, animals and objects use them for collage.</li>
	<li>Enjoy puppet play with your child. All you need to get started is a sock or even just a paper bag!  Make it be anything you want.</li>
	<li>Listen to music or make musical instruments from everyday objects like empty milk cartons filled with uncooked rice or pebbles, or rubber bands stretched over an opened box.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screen time and imaginative play</h2>

<p>Preschoolers should have an hour of screen time a day, at most.  However, there can be ways to use that time creatively.</p>

<p>For example, drawing or painting on a screen can develop your child’s ability to use shape and colour in imaginative ways. Or your child might get new play ideas to explore at home from something he sees in a quality TV show or other digital medium.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In general, the key events in development happen in a similar order, but the age they happen might vary for each child. If you’re concerned about any aspect of your child’s development, it’s a good idea to talk with your family health provider or your child care educator.</p>",3966,55,"52,57",59,60,"2586, 2591, 2596, 76, 2426, 2431, 2436, 4241, 4246, 4251",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/play-preschooler-development/imagining-play-preschoolers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/play-preschooler-development/imagining-play-preschoolers</a></p>",en,published
2231,Movement and play: preschoolers,"Play is key to all areas of children’s development, including movement and motor skills development.Preschoolers generally enjoy being active, although different children prefer different activities.Play ideas for preschooler movement include play with balls, boxes and pegs, outdoor play, rough-and-tumble play, and nature play.","<h2>Preschooler play: why it’s important for movement and physical development</h2>

<p>Play is one of the main ways that children learn, develop and grow. Play is good for all areas of your preschooler’s development, including his physical or motor skills development.</p>

<p>Playing with your preschooler each day strengthens her muscles and bones and gives her the chance to practise physical skills. It’s also good for your toddler’s confidence, as she tests her abilities and discovers that she can climb higher, run faster and jump further all the time.</p>

<p>And when your preschooler gets lots of physical activity into his day through play, it’s good for his overall health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Preschoolers need hours of active play every day.  However, this play can range from running and jumping to quieter activities like helping with everyday household tasks and going for walks.</p>

<h2>What to expect: preschoolers and movement</h2>

<p>Children of this age generally enjoy being active, although different children prefer different types of play and physical activity.</p>

<p>At <strong>3-4 years</strong>, your preschooler will probably:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>start to dress on her own</li>
	<li>use scissors quite well</li>
	<li>ride a tricycle by four years and start trying to ride a bike</li>
	<li>jump over small objects and swing independently on the swing</li>
	<li>walk up and down stairs without using a hand rail</li>
	<li>be more coordinated – for example, she might be able to kick a ball using her right or left leg</li>
	<li>be able to stand on one foot for short periods of time (both right and left).</li>
</ul>

<p>At <strong>five years</strong>, your preschooler is more coordinated and stronger. You might find your child can:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>hop well on both his left and right foot</li>
	<li>learn to skip</li>
	<li>dress himself without your help</li>
	<li>learn to tie shoe laces</li>
	<li>throw, hit a ball, and bounce and catch a ball.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this age, your preschooler might want to play organised games with simple rules with other children, but they'll still have difficulty remembering the rules. </p>

<p><strong>Small bumps and falls </strong>are common as your child pushes physical skills to the limit. This is a normal part of how children learn and develop.</p>

<p>If your child doesn’t seem interested in interacting with other children or avoids physically active play, it’s a good idea to talk with your health provider about your child’s development.</p>

<p>Preschoolers with physical disabilities will have different milestones in some areas of their motor skills development.  Your health provider and other professionals will help you support your child's progress.</p>

<h2>Play ideas to get your preschooler moving</h2>

<p>Here are some play ideas to develop your preschooler’s movement skills – and to help you have fun together!</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Give your preschooler some child-friendly like balls, throwable beanbags.</li>
	<li>Give your preschooler some large cardboard boxes. Your child can climb on top of them, crawl through them and push them around.</li>
	<li>If possible, help your child learn to ride a small bicycle.  Keep safety in mind, of course.</li>
	<li>If possible, make time for outdoor play at a park or playground--or if not, in your own backyard. </li>
	<li>Listen to music that your child can dance to. You can also learn or make up actions to the songs together. Give your child some fabric to wave and move with the music.</li>
	<li>Go for a nature walk, even close to home. This gets your child moving, and he can also collect leaves, sticks or pebbles for craft or pretend play.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quiet, gentle activities</strong> are just as important for your preschooler’s development as play that’s loud or energetic and encourages bigger movements. For example, preschoolers can practise coordinating the small movements of their fingers through play activities like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>play with small building toys or puzzle pieces</li>
	<li>playdough play</li>
	<li>drawing, scribbling and writing activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children learn from watching their parents. So if you want your child to be active, it’s good for you to be active too.</p>",4791,55,"52,57",59,60,"2441, 2446, 2451, 2456, 2461, 2466, 76, 2426, 2431, 2436",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/play-preschooler-development/movement-play-preschoolers"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/play-preschooler-development/movement-play-preschoolers</a></p>",en,published
2236,Playdough activities: children 3-6 years,"Playdough is a great sensory and learning experience for children.Playing with playdough is good for creativity, muscle strength and fine motor skills.You can buy playdough or use homemade playdough.","<h2>Playdough activities: why they’re good for children</h2>

<p>Playdough is a wonderful sensory and learning experience for children.</p>

<p>As your child shapes the playdough into a ball or a snake, they’re thinking creatively. The squeezing, pinching and pulling movements also strengthen your child’s hand muscles and develop fine motor skills.</p>

<p>And if you give your child some tools and toys to add to the playdough activity, you can really spark your child’s imagination and creativity.</p>

<h2>What you need for playdough activities</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Bought or homemade playdough – see the recipes below</li>
	<li>Tools for cutting, shaping and making patterns – for example, ice-cream sticks, plastic knives and forks, rolling pins, cookie cutters and so on</li>
	<li>Things for imaginative play – for example, plastic animals, toy cars, natural objects like sticks and seashells, or pretend baking equipment like muffin trays or cake tins</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to play with playdough</h2>

<p>Your child can play with playdough anywhere, but it’s best to sit your child at a table. This gives your child a good work surface and can stop things from getting too messy. You can use a plastic placemat if you want to keep the surface clean.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s how to get started:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Let your child experiment with the playdough.</li>
	<li>Show your child how to roll, stretch and flatten playdough.</li>
	<li>Talk about how the playdough feels, and what your child is making.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are <strong>ideas to help your child get creative</strong> with playdough:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child objects to make patterns in the playdough. For example, your child could use a fork to make a dot pattern. Your child could press a seashell into the playdough, or make tracks with a toy car.</li>
	<li>Encourage imaginative play with muffin trays and pretend baking equipment. For example, your child could pretend they’re making a cake with the playdough.</li>
	<li>Give your child plastic animals to use with the playdough. For example, your child could make a lake for the ducks, or roll some playdough into balls to make apples for a horse.</li>
	<li>Make playdough people with your child. Your child can bend them into different poses. Or your child can squish them up and start again if they want to.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re making your own playdough, you can get your child involved. Let your child measure, pour and mix the ingredients. Your child will feel excited and proud that they’re making their own toy.</p>

<h2>Adapting for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Your <strong>younger child</strong> might just want to enjoy the sensation of playdough or stick to making shapes and textures.</p>

<p>Your <strong>older child</strong> might like to make things like animals or people.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to follow your child’s lead, and let your child use the playdough in a way that suits their interests.</p>

<h2>Homemade playdough recipes</h2>

<p><strong>Cooked playdough</strong><br />
This playdough keeps well in the fridge. Its high salt content makes it taste unpleasant. It isn’t safe to eat.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>2 cups plain flour</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons cream of tartar</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
	<li>1 cup salt</li>
	<li>food colouring</li>
	<li>2 cups water</li>
</ul>

<p>Method:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mix the ingredients in a saucepan.</li>
	<li>Stir over a medium heat for about five minutes until mixture binds and congeals.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Salt-free playdough</strong><br />
This playdough is best for younger children. It won’t last as long as cooked playdough.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>2 cups plain flour</li>
	<li>½ cup of oil</li>
	<li>food colouring</li>
	<li>water</li>
</ul>

<p>Method:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mix oil and flour.</li>
	<li>Add food colouring.</li>
	<li>Slowly mix in water until you get the consistency you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>Playdough isn’t a food, but sometimes children are tempted to taste it. If it’s hard to stop your child putting things into their mouth, use salt-free playdough, which is safer.</p>",4631,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"4831, 4826, 4836",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/playdough-activities"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/playdough-activities</a></p>",en,published
2241,Memory game for kids: 3-6 years,"Memory games for kids build thinking skills, concentration, attention and persistence.In this memory game, your child tries to remember objects you’ve hidden under a cloth.All you need is a collection of small household objects, a tray and a cloth.","<h2>Memory games for kids: why they’re good</h2>

<p>Memory games for kids are fun and challenging. They:</p>

<ul>
	<li>build thinking skills, concentration and attention span</li>
	<li>build persistence</li>
	<li>give children the chance to try new things without fear of failure.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this memory game, your child tries to remember objects you’ve hidden under a cloth. When you reveal the objects at the end of the round, your child gets instant feedback on how their remembering. It’s rewarding and just a little bit frustrating, which encourages your child to try again.</p>

<h2>What you need for this memory game</h2>

<p>You can <strong>play this game with things you already have at home</strong>. You need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a tray, like a baking tray or serving tray</li>
	<li>a collection of small objects that will fit on the tray</li>
	<li>a cloth to cover the tray, like a small towel</li>
	<li>something to time with, like a watch or your phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s better if you <strong>choose plenty of different things for the tray</strong> – for example, a teaspoon, a small toy, a leaf, a packet of tissues, a ring, a coin, a plastic animal, a pair of glasses, and so on.</p>

<h2>How to play this memory game with your child</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Spread the objects out on the tray and cover them with the cloth.</li>
	<li>Set the timer for one minute. You can adjust the time to be longer or shorter – just do what works best for you and your child.</li>
	<li>When your child is ready, remove the cloth and give your child one minute to look at the tray and memorise the items.</li>
	<li>When the time is up, cover the items with a cloth.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to name the items or write them down if they can.</li>
	<li>Uncover the items again and let your child see which ones they remembered and which ones they forgot.</li>
	<li>Count how many items your child remembered.</li>
	<li>Repeat the game. This time your child can time you, and see how many items you can remember.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can <strong>play as many times as you like</strong>. You could use the same items, or replace them with new items. You and your child can also take turns to be the ‘rememberer’.</p>

<h2>Adapting for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Adjust the number of objects on the tray for older and younger children.</p>

<p><strong>Your young child</strong> will cope better with fewer objects, because this gives your child a better chance of success.  </p>

<p>You could try showing <strong>your older child</strong> the items for a minute. Then remove one or two items and ask your child to pick which ones are missing.   Your older child may also enjoy directing the game entirely--finding objects to put under the cloth, and so on.</p>",3176,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"226, 156, 4831",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/memory-game"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/memory-game</a></p>",en,published
2246,Noticing nature walk: activity for children 3-6 years,A noticing nature walk is about observing the environment with all senses.All you need is somewhere to walk.Going at your child’s pace and asking questions can encourage your child to notice things.,"<h2>A ‘noticing’ nature walk: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Going on a nature walk and deliberately noticing things encourages children to observe with all their senses. Children can learn to focus their attention and take in the details of things around them. It can be a peaceful, reflective experience for you and your children.</p>

<h2>What you need for a noticing nature walk</h2>

<p>All you need is <strong>somewhere to walk</strong>.</p>

<p>You can even do a nature walk in your own backyard or garden.  If you are able to go further at this time, you could:</p>

<ul>
	<li>walk around your local area if you live near a forest or other natural environment</li>
	<li>go to a local park</li>
	<li>plan a longer family excursion to a nature reserve or beach.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to do a noticing nature walk</h2>

<p>Walk with your child, at your child’s pace.</p>

<p>Encourage your child to pay attention to the environment with all their senses. You can do this by asking questions as you go. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Seeing questions</strong>: what can you see? Look all around you, up at the sky and down at the ground.</li>
	<li><strong>Smelling questions</strong>: what can you smell? Can you describe the smell? Leafy? Like mud?</li>
	<li><strong>Hearing questions</strong>: what can you hear? Birds? The wind? Other people?</li>
	<li><strong>Feeling and touching questions</strong>: what can you feel? Is the sun warm? Is the ground rough or smooth?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can collect small items, if you’re allowed to, like leaves, pebbles and feathers. Talk about them – for example, ‘What kind of bird do you think this came from?’ and ‘What a pretty pattern on that leaf!’</p>

<p>Take as long as your child wants. You don’t have to finish the walk if something catches your child’s interest along the way. Let the walk be about connecting with the environment and enjoying time together, rather than getting to the end.</p>

<p>When you get home, make some time for your child to reflect on the walk. Your child could draw pictures of it, write a story about it, or perhaps make a collage with leaves and feathers.</p>

<h2>Adapting a noticing nature walk for children of different ages</h2>

<p>You can adapt this activity to your child’s age in the way you talk, the questions you ask, how far you walk and how fast or slow you go.</p>",3171,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"226, 4316, 2421, 156, 4831",,1,0,<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/noticing-nature-walk-activity-for-children-3-6-years</p>,en,published
2251,Listening walk: activity for children 4-6 years,"On a listening walk, your child tries to focus on sounds. A listening walk helps your child learn to pay attention. A listening walk can also be a mindfulness activity.","<h2>Listening walk: why it’s a good activity for children</h2>

<p>On a listening walk, your child tries to focus on the sounds h/she hears around him/her. When your child really listens to background sounds, he/she’ll realise how much she can notice when he/she pays attention.</p>

<p>A listening walk is also a great way for you and your child to pay attention to what’s happening right now, moment by moment. This kind of attention is known as mindfulness. Mindfulness can help your child skills deal with the stresses of life right now and also with life stresses as he/she gets older.</p>

<h2>What you need for a listening walk</h2>

<p>You just need somewhere to walk. You can go for a listening walk anywhere. Familiar places are often good to start with, because your child can listen and hear things she hasn’t noticed before. Right now, many families' walks are limited to their own yard and perhaps the nearby neighborhood. That's fine for this activity.</p>

<h2>How to do a listening walk</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Ask your child where he’d like to walk, considering the choices that are available. You can choose somewhere nearby. Or if you have time and it is possible, you could plan a listening walk in a forest or a botanic garden, or in a wildlife sanctuary. Natural sounds like leaves rustling, sounds of small animals, the crunch of gravel, and birdsong can be enjoyable and relaxing for you both.</li>
	<li>Talk to your child about how to listen very carefully while you’re on your walk. You could ask your child what sounds he/she expects to hear.</li>
	<li>Stop often, and in different places. Close your eyes together. Ask your child what he/she can hear.</li>
	<li>Notice sounds, both near and far away. Talk about how loud the sounds are. Talk about what’s making the sounds. Are they made by people or machines, or are they natural noises like wind or birds?</li>
	<li>Keep it fun. Let your child take the lead. Stop when your child has had enough. Have fun walking home together.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting a listening walk for younger and older children</h2>

<p>You can make this fun for your younger child by encouraging him/her to copy some of the noises he/she hears. See whether your child can make a sound like a bird or a car engine, or make her footsteps sound louder or softer.</p>

<p>With your help, your older preschool child could write a story about the walk or draw a sound map afterwards, showing where he has walked and what he has heard along the way.</p>",4636,55,"57,58",59,60,"4831, 4316, 226, 2421",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/listening-walk"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/listening-walk</a></p>",en,published
2256,Playing with balls: activities for children 3-6 years,"Playing with balls makes physical activity fun.Throwing, catching and kicking balls is good for muscle development, hand-eye coordination and fitness. You don’t have to buy expensive balls. You can make even your own with rolled-up socks or newspaper.","<h2>Playing with balls: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Playing with balls makes physical activity fun.</p>

<p>Also, throwing, catching, rolling and kicking balls helps with many skills:</p>

<ul>
	<li>works arm and leg muscles</li>
	<li>improves hand-eye coordination</li>
	<li>increases fitness</li>
	<li>encourages social interaction when playing with others</li>
</ul>

<p>Younger preschoolers just enjoy playing with a ball.  When older preschoolers practise ball skills, they’ll notice their skills improving. This helps children understand that they can learn and get better at something if they try. And this <strong>builds self-esteem and confidence</strong>.</p>

<p>Playing with balls with children is also <strong>a great way to spend quality time together</strong> and build relationships.</p>

<h2>What you need for playing with balls</h2>

<p>You and your child can play with balls of any size, colour and texture.</p>

<p>You probably already have a ball or two at home. You can make a soft ball to use inside using a pair of rolled-up socks, or a scrunched-up piece of newspaper and some tape. Just start with what you have.</p>

<h2>How to play with balls</h2>

<p>With younger preschoolers, or a child who has physical disabilities, start simply:  holding and rolling a ball.  Ramps to roll balls on can be fun indoors.  Later, introduce a few basic ball skills – catching, throwing or kicking.</p>

<p>As your child gets better at these skills, you can kick or throw a ball at a target or into a goal, through a hoop or to another person. Just pick an activity that you and your child enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Try these ideas:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Teach your child to catch using a big, soft ball. Start close together and slowly increase the distance between you as your child’s skills improve. Praise your child and remind your child how close you were when you started practising.</li>
	<li>Play with soft balls (or a ball of socks) inside with your child. Take turns to throw them into a bucket or laundry basket. You could move the bucket or basket closer when it’s your child’s turn.</li>
	<li>Take a ball outdoors--to your yard or if possible, to a playground. Practise kicking it to each other or to a goal or target. Pick an easy target so your child can feel successful.</li>
	<li>Take a ball outside and bounce it together. Your child could practise dribbling it like a basketball player, or you could bounce it back and forth to each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Bigger, softer balls are easier for <strong>your young child</strong> to kick and catch.</p>

<p>For kicking, your child needs to be able to balance on one foot. If your child has trouble kicking, she could hold onto a tree or a piece of playground equipment while you kick a ball back and forth.</p>

<p>Small balls can be fun for <strong>your older child</strong> to bounce or throw at a target. You can also play ball games using bats or racquets if you have them. You could also just hit a ball of scrunched-up newspaper across a room in your house.</p>

<p>Your older child might also like to play a ball game (whatever game is enjoyed in your community) with a group of friends. Keep the rules simple and be ready to step in if children start to have trouble with sharing or losing.  It is not easy for young children to learn to play games with rules.</p>",3161,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"4356, 4341, 206, 4831",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/playing-with-balls-activity"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/playing-with-balls-activity</a></p>",en,published
2261,Treasure hunt: activity for children 3-6 years,An outdoor treasure hunt game encourages children to be active and explore.You set up a treasure hunt by hiding clues and treasure.Clues can be simple drawings. Older children might be able to read written clues.,"<h2>Treasure hunt: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>A treasure hunt is all about looking for something and then finding it. An outdoor treasure hunt game encourages children to be active and to explore.</p>

<p>A treasure hunt is <strong>a fun and satisfying experience</strong> for children of all ages.</p>

<h2>What you need for a treasure hunt</h2>

<p>You can do a treasure hunt anywhere, but <strong>an outdoor space with lots of interesting things</strong> to look at and places to hide things is more fun to explore.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need for a treasure hunt:</p>

<ul>
	<li>paper and pencils to prepare the clues in advance</li>
	<li>a ‘treasure’ to hide</li>
	<li>someone to supervise your child while you hide the treasure and clues – for example, someone to take your child for a short walk or play with your child in another area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your ‘treasure’ doesn’t have to be something special. A household item like a colourful ball or a plastic bottle works really well.</p>

<h2>How to have a treasure hunt</h2>

<p>You set up a treasure hunt by hiding clues and the treasure. The clues can be simple drawings that your child has to find. Each clue tells your child where to find the next clue. The final clue leads to the treasure.</p>

<p>Here’s how to have a treasure hunt:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Plan the hunt first. Decide where to hide the treasure and work backwards. For example, you might plan to hide the treasure beneath the slide. The clue to the slide might be at the water fountain. The clue to the water fountain might be at the park bench and so on.</li>
	<li>Draw pictures for each of the clues. For example, draw a picture of the slide, a picture of the water fountain, a picture of the park bench and so on.</li>
	<li>Hide the treasure and the clues while your child is supervised somewhere else.</li>
	<li>When you’re ready, tell your child it’s time for the treasure hunt. Give your child the first clue and encourage them to look for the others until they’ve found the treasure.</li>
	<li>Talk with your child about the treasure hunt. For example, ‘Was it hard?’ or ‘Was it fun?’ Praise your child for not giving up and finding the treasure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting a treasure hunt for children of different ages</h2>

<p>Your <strong>younger child</strong> might find hunting for clues a bit challenging. You can have a simpler treasure by getting your child to look for everyday items in the park. Here’s how:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make a list of things for your child to collect – for example, a round pebble, a pointy leaf, a red flower or a seed.</li>
	<li>Give your child a basket or bag for the things they find.</li>
	<li>Talk with your child about the shapes, colours and textures of the things they find. Try comparing the things. For example, ‘Which is bigger – the leaf or the flower?’</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to hunt for treasure is to draw a very simple map of the park, showing landmarks like the slide, the water fountain and the park bench. Use an ‘X’ to mark the spot where you’ve hidden the treasure.</p>

<p>Your <strong>older child</strong> who’s learning to read might be able to read written clues with your help. Treasure at the end is a good way to encourage your child to try!</p>",3156,55,"52,57,58",59,60,"4341, 4316, 226, 2421",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/treasure-hunt-activity-for-children-3-6-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/treasure-hunt-activity-for-children-3-6-years</a></p>",en,published
2266,Counting activities: children 3-6 years,Counting is an early numeracy skill.Counting games can happen anytime and anywhere. You don’t need special equipment. Try simple counting games when you and your child go to the market or the shops.,"<h2>Counting: why it’s good for children</h2>

<p>Counting is <strong>an early numeracy skill</strong>.</p>

<p>Counting helps your child learn the words for numbers and the right sequence for numbers – ‘one, two, three, four, five’. For example, she might learn that ‘five’ is how many fingers she has on one hand, and ‘ten’ is how many fingers she has on both hands. This helps her understand that ‘ten’ is more than ‘five’.</p>

<p>Basic numeracy skills like counting <strong>lay the foundation for more complex numeracy and maths skills</strong>.  These kinds of activities also help your child develop a positive attitude toward maths, as something that is interesting and often exciting.  This builds motivation for later study.</p>

<h2>What you need for counting games and activities with your child</h2>

<p>Counting games and activities can happen anytime and anywhere. You don’t need special equipment or books.</p>

<h2>How to do counting games and activities with your child</h2>

<p><strong>Everyday experiences</strong> can be the best way to give young children fun and relaxed ways to get started with counting.   If you must be mostly at home at this time, you can still enjoy many counting activities with your child.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for counting games and activities with your child on a trip to the market or the shops:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose something your child is interested in to count in your home--for example, let's count how many spoons we need to put on the table for everyone to have one for breakfast.  Or, let's count how many socks are in the clothes dryer.</li>
	<li>If you go to the market with your child, there are many things you can plan to count on the way to the market – for example, cars or dogs. It’s best to choose something you know you’ll see lots of. This means your child won’t get bored waiting for the next one to appear.</li>
	<li>At the market, ask your child to help you count fruits or vegetables as you put them in your trolley or basket. For example, ‘We need six apples. Can you help me count to six?’  (at home, you can do something similar--""I will need four potatoes for our dinner.  Can you get four for me, please?""</li>
	<li>Count steps as you walk. For example, count how many steps it takes to get from the apples to the bread. You could also ask your child to guess and then see whether he was right. (Again, at home it can be fun to count how many steps from the living room to the bedroom)</li>
	<li>Count the people who are lining up in front of you to pay. Count again as each one pays and leaves, so your child can see the number getting smaller.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adapting counting activities for children of different ages</h2>

<p>It’s best to keep numbers small for <strong>your younger child</strong>. You can help her associate numbers with words – for example, ‘We need two bananas for lunch. Can you show me two with your fingers?’</p>

<p><strong>Your older preschooler</strong> will enjoy harder challenges. Try counting by twos – for example, ‘We need eight apples. Two, four, six …’. Or at home:  ""So we counted eight socks.  Let's roll them up into pairs and find out how many pairs we will make!""</p>",3151,55,"52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/counting-activities-3-6-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/activity-guides/counting-activities-3-6-years</a></p>",en,published
2271,Museum activities for children: 3-6 years,"Museum activities can be fun and engaging for children.Look for child-friendly museums near you or museums that suit your child’s interests.Tell your child about the museum before you go, and follow your child’s lead when you get there.","<h2>Museum activities: why they’re good for children</h2>

<p>A trip to the museum can be fun for you and your child.</p>

<p>Many museums have child-friendly exhibits, where ideas and information are presented in an interactive and engaging way. Some museums also have spaces designed for children, with play areas and simple activities.</p>

<p>By wandering around a museum with you, your child can learn a lot about science, art, history or culture – without even trying.</p>

<h2>What you need for museum activities with children</h2>

<p>You need a museum to visit!</p>

<p>You can go online to find museums in your area. See which ones are child friendly or have exhibits that might suit your child’s interests. You can also look for specialty museums – for example, museums dedicated to science or the air force.</p>

<p>The important thing is that you and your child have fun.</p>

<p>A trip to the museum can mean a long day for a child, and on-site cafes can be expensive and crowded. You could bring your own healthy snacks and water. Just check with staff or look at the museum map to find out which museum areas permit eating and drinking.</p>

<h2>How to enjoy museum activities with children</h2>

<p>Here are some suggestions to help you and your child get the most out of visiting the museum:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tell your child a bit about the museum before you go. Explain what your child is likely to see, as well as any rules – for example, ‘Some of the paintings we’re going to see are very precious, so we can’t touch them’.</li>
	<li>Ask for a map and show it to your child. Follow your child’s lead. For example, ask where your child wants to go first.</li>
	<li>If your child is interested in an exhibit, build on this interest by asking questions – for example, ‘Why do you think it had such big teeth?’</li>
	<li>Be flexible. Museums can be very stimulating for children. If it looks like your child is getting tired, take a break or go home early. You don’t have to see everything in one day.</li>
</ul>

<p>Museums often provide a lot of information on their exhibits. This can be great if you need to explain what your child is seeing, but you don’t need to read everything out or try to help your child remember things. Your child is more likely to learn if they’re not being bored by too much information.</p>

<h2>Adapting museum activities for children of different ages</h2>

<p><strong>Your younger child</strong> might rush past exhibits without seeming to notice them. Your child might also use something the ‘wrong’ way – for example, repeatedly pushing a button in an interactive display just to see the lights. Be patient, and try to see the museum from your child’s point of view.</p>

<p>Museums are a good way to let <strong>your older child</strong> learn more about something that interests them, like trains or dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Many museums have virtual tours. You can explore museums and exhibits that interest your child anywhere in the world – all from your own home.</p>

2276,Early literacy difficulties,"Early literacy difficulties include problems with speaking and listening, knowing letters, and sounding out words. Babies and children develop language at different rates, so not all early language issues are signs of literacy difficulties. Consider professional advice if your child is 3-4 years old and you’re worried about the way she speaks, listens and recognises letters.","<h2>About early literacy difficulties</h2>

<p>Some children with early literacy difficulties will catch up to their peers. But some children who make slow early progress often need extra help. If they struggle in the <strong>preschool and early school years</strong>, they can experience delays in literacy development over the long term.</p>

<p>So it’s a good idea to seek professional advice if your child is 3-4 years old and you’re worried about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the way your child speaks and listens</li>
	<li>your child’s ability to recognise alphabet letters</li>
	<li>the way your child puts sounds together to make words.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a family history of literacy difficulties, it’s also good to seek advice.</p>

<p>If you need help or advice, you could start by talking to your child’s preschool or school teacher, your child and family health nurse, GP or paediatrician, or a speech pathologist. These professionals should also be able to direct you to other services and support.</p>

<h2>Signs of early literacy difficulties: 3-4 years</h2>

<p>Babies and children develop language at different rates. For example, many children who are late to start talking have caught up by the time they’re 3-4 years old. This means that we can’t say that very early issues with words and language are signs of early literacy difficulties.</p>

<p>But by the time children are <strong>3-4 years old</strong>, some problems with words and language might be signs of literacy difficulties.</p>

<p>If your child is 3-4 years old, he might be having early literacy difficulties if he:</p>

<ul>
	<li>is late to start talking and has difficulty learning and remembering new words</li>
	<li>leaves out the words he needs to make a complete sentence – for example, ‘I going zoo’ rather than ‘I’m going to the zoo’</li>
	<li>doesn’t recognise any alphabet letters</li>
	<li>has difficulty scribbling to make shapes that look like letters</li>
	<li>doesn’t string similar-sounding words together – for example, ‘cat, bat, hat’</li>
	<li>can’t repeat at least parts of nursery rhymes.</li>
</ul>

<p>With <strong>reading</strong>, seek help or advice if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>can’t tell you what action is going on in a picture book – for example, running, barking, eating</li>
	<li>can’t seem to tell the difference between the front and back of the book, or doesn’t know that she can hold it the right way up</li>
	<li>can’t name simple objects represented in books</li>
	<li>forgets which books she has read before, even when you show her their covers</li>
	<li>doesn’t like listening to an adult read to her on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Literacy difficulties: 5 years and over</h2>

<p>In <strong>spoken language</strong>, your child might be having literacy difficulties if he has trouble:</p>

<ul>
	<li>understanding simple instructions – for example, ‘Please put your coat on’</li>
	<li>incorporating new words when he speaks</li>
	<li>using noticeably longer sentences – for example, sentences of more than five words</li>
	<li>recognising and coming up with words that start the same way like ‘car, cat, can’, and sounds that rhyme like ‘rat, mat, sat’</li>
	<li>breaking simple words into their parts (syllables or single sounds) like ‘ba-na-na’, or putting sounds together to make words</li>
	<li>using mature grammar – for example, he says ‘She broked the glasses’ instead of ‘She broke the glasses’</li>
	<li>using comparison words like ‘heavier’, ‘stronger’ or ‘shorter’. For example, if you said, ‘A car is big, but a bus is ... ?’, your child should reply, ‘Bigger’</li>
	<li>telling or retelling stories in the right order.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <strong>reading</strong>, your child might be having literacy difficulties if she:</p>

<ul>
	<li>doesn’t show interest in books and reading</li>
	<li>mixes up the sequence of events in stories</li>
	<li>can’t relate what happens in books to things in her own life</li>
	<li>gets distracted when books are read aloud and doesn’t get meaning and pleasure from this activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <strong>understanding print concepts</strong>, your child might be having literacy difficulties if he:</p>

<ul>
	<li>doesn’t know that words in print are different from pictures, and are there to be read</li>
	<li>doesn’t know that each letter in the alphabet has a name and a sound</li>
	<li>can’t name at least eight letters</li>
	<li>doesn’t scribble his name, messages and so on – it doesn’t matter whether you can read what he scribbles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Helping children with literacy difficulties</h2>

<p>If your child is having literacy difficulties, it’s important to keep giving her lots of opportunities to experience language and print in all its forms. This will help prepare your child for reading and writing tasks at school.</p>

<p>Here are some things you can do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child lots of encouragement for reading, writing and drawing, even if he keeps making mistakes. For example, encourage your child to read by giving him lots of books, magazines, brochures and other print materials. He’s more likely to read something if it interests him.</li>
	<li>Once your child starts reading, make times to read with her. Sometimes she can read to you, and sometimes you can read to her. If she’s struggling, this will help her avoid too much frustration.</li>
	<li>Use everyday opportunities for reading and writing. For example, read street and shop signs, menus, prices and labels at the supermarket. You could also write an email, letter or a text message to a friend. This shows your child how useful reading and writing are.</li>
	<li>Make writing fun. For example, when your child starts writing, you can encourage him to make birthday cards or write shopping lists. You could write notes to your child and leave them in a special spot, like his lunch box. Why not ask him to write back to you too?</li>
	<li>Visit your local library – it’s free to join and borrow.</li>
	<li>If your child is at school, make sure your child is ready to learn by being organised in the morning. It will help her to have routines and quiet times to do her reading.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once your child starts school, you can also <strong>check in with the teacher about your child’s progress</strong>. You might need to work with the teacher on a support plan for your child. The earlier you and the teacher step in to help your child, the better his progress will be in the long term.</p>

2281,Crying: babies and children 0-8 years,"Crying – all babies and children do it, and some cry a lot. But knowing this doesn’t always make it easier to cope with crying. The good news is that children tend to cry less as they grow and develop.","<h2>About crying in babies and children</h2>

<p>All children cry when they’re hungry, tired, uncomfortable, sick or in pain. Sometimes they cry because they need affection. Toddlers and older children might also cry because they’re frustrated, sad or angry, for example.</p>

<p>But it can sometimes be hard to work out what your crying child needs, especially if she isn’t talking yet.</p>

<p>So when your child cries, <strong>start by checking that he isn’t sick or hurt</strong>. If you’re not sure, make an appointment with your health provider.</p>

<p>If your child is crying for another reason, there are lots of things you can do to help.</p>

<p>Never shake, hit or hurt a crying child. If you feel like you might hurt your child, stop before you do anything. Walk away and take some deep breaths. Call someone for help--a friend, neighbor, or a professional if available.</p>

<h2>Babies: crying</h2>

<p>Babies are born with the ability to cry. Crying is their main way of communicating.</p>

<p>Around 1 in 10 babies cry a lot – ‘a lot’ means more than three hours a day. Babies under 12 months of age tend to cry most in the late afternoon and early evening. This can be very stressful for you.</p>

<p>This stage of intense crying will pass, probably sooner than you think.</p>

<p><strong>How to manage your baby’s crying</strong><br />
The first step is to check whether your baby is hungry, tired or uncomfortable. Over time, you’ll get to know what your babies different cries mean.</p>

<p>Here are some other helpful strategies:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Put your baby in a pram or a baby sling and go for a walk. Even if your baby doesn’t stop crying, it’s sometimes easier to cope when you’re on the move.</li>
	<li>Ask a friend or relative to help at the times of day when your baby cries most. It's always ok to ask for help.</li>
	<li>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, <strong>put your baby somewhere safe and take a five-minute break</strong>. Letting your baby cry for a few minutes won’t hurt her, and it can help you get things under control.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you comfort your crying baby, he learns that the world is a safe and predictable place. He trusts you and tends to cry less.</p>

<h2>Toddlers: crying</h2>

<p>Toddlers cry for the same reasons as babies. But toddlers also cry as a way of dealing with new and difficult emotions like frustration, embarrassment or jealousy.</p>

<p><strong>How to manage your toddler’s crying</strong><br />
If your child is physically OK, the following tips might help:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you think your child might be tired, a rest might help. Or you could give her some quiet time listening to music or a story.</li>
	<li>If the crying happens at bedtime, you might need some help settling your child.</li>
	<li>If your child is angry or having a tantrum, take him somewhere safe to calm down.</li>
	<li>If your child is frustrated, try to work out a solution together. For example, ‘You’re frustrated because the blocks keep falling over. Let’s try again together’. Naming an emotion lets your child know that you understand her feelings. It also helps her learn self-regulation.</li>
	<li>If your toddler is just cranky, try a change of scenery like a walk outside, give him a bubble bath, or put on some kids’ music and dance around together. You might be surprised how much fun you have.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preschoolers and school-age children: crying</h2>

<p>Once your child can talk, it’s <strong>much easier for her to use words to tell you why she’s upset</strong> and what she needs. It’s also likely to be easier for you to talk with her about her feelings.</p>

<p><strong>How to manage your preschooler’s or school-age child’s crying</strong><br />
If your child is physically OK, try the following ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child a chance to calm down, then ask him what has made him so upset. Show you’re listening by repeating his feelings back to him. For example, ‘You’re feeling sad because Sam wouldn’t play with you’.</li>
	<li>Offer your child some other ways to deal with the situation. For example, ‘How about you ask to join in Jai’s game instead?’</li>
	<li>Make sure your child understands that sometimes it’s OK to cry – for example, when something sad happens or when she gets hurt. For example, ‘Ouch, I’d be crying too if I hit my head’.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child seems to spend a lot of time crying and acting sad, consider asking your health provider for advice.  Friends and neighbors may also be helpful.</p>

<p>For both children and grown-ups, crying can be a healthy way to deal with significant loss or sadness. When your child expresses these feelings to you, try to listen. Then you can comfort him and reassure him that his feelings are OK.</p>

<h2>Crying: your feelings</h2>

<p>Crying in babies and children is one of the most common reasons parents seek <strong>professional help</strong>.</p>

<p>If your child is crying a lot, you might be feeling very low, or even depressed. If you feel like this or are having thoughts about hurting your child, it’s important to seek help straight away.</p>

<p>You can contact a parenting hotline or a parenting support service in your area. Our article on services and support has a list of places and people to help you.</p>

<p>Sometimes it helps to have another person take over for a while. If you can, ask your partner to come home, or get a friend or relative to come over and help out.</p>

<p>Parenting can be really hard work, especially if you have a child who cries a lot. Taking time out and asking for help are positive things you can do for yourself and your child.</p>

<h2>Crying in front of your children</h2>

<p>Seeing your emotions also teaches your child that grownups are people with feelings too.</p>

<p>But if you’re crying a lot, or crying without knowing why, you might need to speak with your health provider about getting some help for depression.</p>",3136,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"381, 4411, 4416, 4421, 4426, 4431",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/crying/crying-0-8-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/crying/crying-0-8-years</a></p>",en,published
2286,Baby cues and baby body language: a guide,"Your baby’s body language can tell you how she’s feeling and what she needs.Look for baby cues for tiredness, alertness, hunger, discomfort and more.Watch the videos below to see baby cues in action.","<h2>About baby cues and body language</h2>

<p>Your baby’s body language can tell you how he’s feeling and what he needs from you.</p>

<p>Your baby’s body language gives you important cues about whether she’s:</p>

<ul>
	<li>tired</li>
	<li>hungry</li>
	<li>wide awake and ready to play</li>
	<li>needing a break.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why it’s important to respond to baby cues</h2>

<p>When you notice your baby’s body language and respond to it, he feels safe and secure. This helps you to build a strong relationship with your baby. And a strong relationship with you and other main caregivers is vital to your baby’s development.</p>

<h2>Recognising baby cues</h2>

<p>All babies give cues to how they’re feeling and what they need from you. But each baby develops her own mix of signs to tell you what she wants. Eventually you’ll get to know your baby’s individual cues and what they tell you about your baby’s feelings.</p>

<p>And as you and your baby get to know each other, you’ll figure out the best way to respond to your baby’s individual cues too. For example, your grizzling baby might look relaxed when you smile at him, or he might seem to like it better when you sing and talk to him. This helps you know how to respond the next time he grizzles.</p>

<h2>Baby cues that say 'I'm tired'</h2>

<p>Tired signs in babies include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>staring into the distance</li>
	<li>jerky movements</li>
	<li>yawning</li>
	<li>fussing</li>
	<li>sucking fingers</li>
	<li>losing interest in people or toys.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you recognise tired signs in your baby, it’s a good idea to start settling baby for sleep.</p>

<h2>Baby cues that say ‘I'm hungry’</h2>

<p>Newborns need to feed every 2-3 hours. When your baby is hungry, she might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>make sucking noises</li>
	<li>turn towards the breast.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can start to look for these cues every 1-2 hours in newborns or every 3-4 hours for an older baby.</p>

<p>When you recognise hunger signs in your baby, it’s a good idea to offer him a feed. Looking for your baby’s hunger signs is a better way to work out when to feed than waiting for a set number of hours.</p>

<h2>Baby cues that say ‘I want to play’</h2>

<p>Older babies usually follow a ‘feed-play-sleep’ routine.</p>

<p>Cues that your baby is ready to play with you include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>eyes wide and bright</li>
	<li>eye contact with you</li>
	<li>smiles</li>
	<li>smooth movements</li>
	<li>hands reaching out to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you recognise ‘ready to play’ signs in your baby, it’s a good time to smile and talk to your baby. Baby play is simple: the best toy for your baby is you, and the best baby game is playing with you.</p>

<h2>Baby cues that say ‘I need a break’</h2>

<p>Babies who are four months and older might not always be ready for a nap after their play time. Sometimes they might want a change of pace or activity instead. So what do these baby cues look like?</p>

<p>If your baby wants a break from what she’s doing right now, she might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>turn her head away from you</li>
	<li>squirm or kick.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you recognise ‘ready for a break’ signs in your baby, it’s a good idea to give him some quiet time or a different activity. For example, if your baby turns his head away from the rattle you’re showing him, you could lie him on his back to look at his mobile for a while.</p>",3131,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"546, 361, 2381, 4441, 996",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/crying/baby-cues"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/crying/baby-cues</a></p>",en,published
2301,Bonding and attachment: newborns,"Bonding and attachment happen when you consistently respond to your newborn with love, warmth and care. Bonding and attachment are vital to your baby’s development.","<h2>About bonding and attachment with newborns</h2>

<p>Bonding and attachment is about always responding to your newborn’s needs with love, warmth and care. When you do this, you become a special, trusted person in your baby’s life.</p>

<p>Bonding between you and your newborn is <strong>a vital part of development</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, when your newborn gets what she needs from you, like a smile, a touch or a cuddle, she feels the world is a safe place to play, learn and explore. This gives her the <strong>foundation for emotional wellbeing</strong> and the ability to cope with setbacks later in life. Bonding and attachment also <strong>help your baby grow mentally and physically</strong>. For example, repeated human contact like touching, cuddling, talking, singing and gazing into each other’s eyes make your newborn’s brain release hormones. These hormones help your baby’s brain to grow. And as his brain grows, he starts to develop memory, thought and language.</p>

<h2>Understanding your newborn’s bonding and attachment behaviour</h2>

<p>Your newborn uses body language to tell you when she needs something – for example, a feed or a nappy change. She’ll also use body language to show you when she <strong>wants to connect</strong> with you and strengthen your bond. She might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>smile at you or make eye contact – babies love to look into your eyes</li>
	<li>make little noises, like coos or laughs</li>
	<li>look relaxed and interested</li>
	<li>cry.</li>
</ul>

<p>When your baby <strong>needs a break</strong> or perhaps a different, gentler approach, he might:</p>

<ul>
	<li>look away, shut his eyes or yawn</li>
	<li>try to struggle or pull away</li>
	<li>look tense and unsettled</li>
	<li>cry.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you learn to ‘read’ your baby’s messages and respond the right way, it encourages her to communicate more. This is good for your bond and also helps your baby learn about communication, behaviour and emotions.</p>

<p>When you notice your baby’s cues and body language and always respond in warm and loving ways, he’ll feel more secure. This helps you to build a strong relationship with your baby.</p>

<h2>How to bond with your newborn</h2>

<p>Bonding with your newborn through warm, gentle affection makes her feel safe. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Regularly touch and cuddle your newborn. </strong>Try rocking him or holding him against you, skin on skin. Or stroke him gently when you change his nappy or bath him.</li>
	<li><strong>Respond to crying. </strong>You might not always be able to tell why your newborn is crying. But by responding, you’re helping her to feel safe.</li>
	<li><strong>Make your newborn feel physically safe. </strong>Provide good head and neck support when you’re holding your baby. Wrapping your baby recreates the secure feeling of being in the womb.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can bond with your newborn by giving him things to look at, listen to and feel. This gets his brain working and makes it grow. Try these ideas:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Talk</strong> to your newborn as often as you can in soothing, reassuring tones. You could talk about what you’re doing, or tell stories. This helps your baby learn to recognise the sound of your voice. It will also help her learn language when she’s older.</li>
	<li><strong>Sing songs.</strong> Your newborn will probably like the up and down sounds of songs and music, as well as rhythm. Soothing music might help him – and you – feel calmer. Your newborn won’t mind if you’ve forgotten the words or the tune.</li>
	<li><strong>Look your newborn in the eyes</strong> while you talk and sing, and make facial expressions. This will help her learn the connection between words and feelings.</li>
	<li><strong>Stimulate your newborn’s sense of touch.</strong> From birth, your newborn can feel even the gentlest touch. Try gently stroking his feet with soft fabric while you’re changing his nappy. And talk about it – for example, ‘Does that feel soft?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>When bonding and attachment isn’t easy</h2>

<p>You might have bonded with your baby the first time you saw her. But it’s <strong>OK and normal if you didn’t feel an instant connection</strong>. Bonding and attachment can sometimes take weeks or months of getting to know and understand your baby.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestion to help your bond develop:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Take time to enjoy being with your baby.</strong> Caring for a new baby can be busy, but it’s good to spend time just being together. For example, you could hold your baby close and read to him in a sing-song voice. He’ll love hearing your voice, even if you’re reading your favourite magazine or newspaper.</li>
	<li><strong>See the world from your baby’s perspective.</strong> Imagine what she’s looking at, feeling or trying to do. Discover what she really likes and dislikes. For example, is she a social baby who doesn’t mind being passed around the family? Or does she prefer to watch what’s going on from the safety of your arms?</li>
	<li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Most newborns don’t have definite day and night sleep patterns. This means it isn’t realistic to expect your newborn to follow a strict routine. It’s best to respond when your baby wants to feed, sleep or play.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re the most important part of your baby’s life. If you’re worried about your relationship with your baby, ask for help. Getting help when your baby is young can make a big difference to both of you. If you need it, find support – if you’re physically and mentally well, you’ll be better able to provide the love and comfort your baby needs.</p>

<h2>Bonding with more than one carer</h2>

<p>Your baby forms his main attachments to the people who care for him the most, like you and your partner, if you have one. He can also form attachments to other people who regularly and lovingly care for him and make him feel safe. These people might include your baby’s grandparents, paid carers and older children.</p>

<p>Bonding to more than one person helps your baby <strong>learn about trust and closeness to people</strong>. It can also make it easier for you and your partner to do other things, like paid work, grocery shopping and household chores. It can also just give you a break from being a carer.</p>

<p>In many cultures, many members of the family and community are involved in raising children, and babies form attachments with many people.</p>",3126,56,"43,44,45",59,60,"371, 4436, 4441, 4446, 4451, 4456, 4461, 4466, 4471, 4476, 4481",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/connecting-communicating/bonding/bonding-newborns"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/connecting-communicating/bonding/bonding-newborns</a></p>",en,published
2311,Can you spoil a baby?,"You can’t ‘spoil’ a young baby. If your newborn is crying, it’s because he needs your help. If you respond calmly and consistently, it helps your baby learn that the world is a safe and predictable place.","<h2>Can you spoil a baby?</h2>

<p>The answer to this question is ‘<strong>No!</strong>’</p>

<p>Babies do need lots of attention, and you might worry – or other people might tell you – that if you ‘give in’ too often or give too much attention, it will ‘spoil’ your baby.</p>

<p>But this won’t happen. <strong>You won’t create bad habits by responding</strong> to your baby’s needs.</p>

<p>Very young babies don’t think to themselves, ‘I’m going to cry until I get what I want!’</p>

<p>If your baby is crying or fussing, there's a good reason:  it might be because she’s cold or hungry, has a dirty nappy, or is in pain. Or she might just want to know you’re nearby.</p>

<h2>Why it’s important to respond to your baby</h2>

<p>Your baby depends on you completely to give him what he needs to grow and develop.</p>

<p>This is <strong>good for baby and good for you</strong>.</p>

<p>Babies who have consistent and nurturing relationships early in life quickly develop <strong>secure attachment to their caregivers</strong>. These babies cope better with stress as preschoolers. They also tend to get along better with other children. And they’re more likely to be physically and emotionally healthier as adults.</p>

<p>Responding to your baby is also good for you, because it <strong>helps you feel like you’re doing a good job</strong> as a parent. It's stressful to listening to your baby crying and not respond!</p>

<h2>Balancing routines and flexibility</h2>

<p>You might worry that if you cuddle your newborn when he won’t settle, he won’t get into a sleeping routine.</p>

<p>But the most important thing in the early months is to help your baby develop security by calmly and consistently responding to her needs.</p>

<p>Most newborns don’t have definite day and night sleep patterns anyway. Routines can come later.</p>

<p>But all babies, families, and cultures are different.  Some parents find a simple, flexible feed, play, sleep routine seems to help their babies and give them a sense of control. Others find that it helps to aim for flexibility rather than routine, especially in the first few months.</p>

<p>At 6-12 months, your baby begins to have some control over his behaviour. This is a good time to start setting gentle limits to form the basis of teaching your child positive behaviour in the future.</p>

<h2>Baby sleep: what to expect</h2>

<p>If you’re worried about spoiling your baby by giving her too much attention – especially if she won’t settle – it can help to know what to expect from newborn baby sleep.</p>

<p>Although newborns sleep, on average, 16 out of every 24 hours, your baby might do this in short naps. During the first few weeks, while you and your baby are getting to know each other, you can introduce settling techniques that will gradually help your baby to sleep for longer periods.  For example, you might swaddle the baby just before settling her in the crib, play soft music, let her fuss just a short while when awakening.  You'll know your baby best.</p>

<h2>Baby feeds: what to expect</h2>

<p>If you feel that your newborn baby is crying to be fed all the time, you’re probably right! In the early days, babies typically need to feed every 2-4 hours. Responding and giving your baby what he needs is key.</p>

<p>It might help to know that most babies establish a manageable pattern of demand feeding over the first few weeks of life.  Gradually, on their own they learn to do most of their feeds during the day and have fewer at night.</p>

<p>A calm and happy feeding time is a great opportunity for you to bond with your baby and build the warm and trusting relationship that’s so important to your baby’s development. </p>

<p>So if friends or relatives are telling you not to ""spoil"" this little person, be confident in your parenting (and get the help you need!).  Say and think, ""I'm giving my new baby what she needs to be secure and happy and to develop well.  When she's older there will be time to worry about other things!"") </p>",3121,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49",59,60,"4506, 371, 4436",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/common-concerns/can-you-spoil-a-baby"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/babies/behaviour/common-concerns/can-you-spoil-a-baby</a></p>",en,published
2316,Building good parent-child relationships,"Positive parent-child relationships are important for all areas of children’s development. By being in the moment, spending quality time and showing warmth, care and respect, you can strengthen your relationship with your child.","<h2>Good parent-child relationships: why they’re important</h2>

<p>Children’s most important early relationships are with parents.</p>

<p>Positive parent-child relationships help children learn about the world – whether the world is safe and secure, whether they’re loved, who loves them, what happens when they cry, laugh or make a face, and much more.</p>

<p>These relationships affect all areas of children’s development.</p>

<p>You can build a positive parent-child relationship by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>being in the moment with your child</li>
	<li>spending quality time with your child</li>
	<li>creating a caring environment of trust and respect.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s no formula for getting your parent-child relationship right, and there’ll be times when it’s hard to relate to your child the way you want to. But if you <strong>keep working on improving your relationship over time</strong>, your child will feel loved and secure.</p>

<h2>How being in the moment helps parent-child relationships</h2>

<p>Being in the moment is about <strong>tuning in and thinking about what’s going on with your child</strong>. It shows your child that you care about the things that matter to him, which is the basis for a strong relationship.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas for being in the moment with your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Show acceptance, let your child be, and try not to give directions all the time. If your child wants to pretend the building blocks are people, that’s OK. You don’t have to get her to use them the ‘right’ way.</li>
	<li>Notice what your child is doing and comment or encourage it. For example, ‘Are the big blue blocks the shopkeepers? And is the little red block doing the shopping? What’s she buying?’.</li>
	<li>Listen to your child and try to tune in to what he’s really saying. For example, if he’s telling you a long story about lots of things that happened during the day, he might really be saying that he likes his new teacher or that he’s in a good mood.</li>
	<li>Think about what your child’s behaviour is telling you, which will give you clues to what she really needs. For example, if your teenage child is hanging around in the kitchen and not talking much, she might just want to be close to you. You could give her a hug or let her help with the cooking, without needing to talk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of being in the moment with your child is <strong>giving him the opportunity to take the lead</strong> sometimes. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you’re playing with your younger child, play what she wants to play, imitate her and really have fun together.</li>
	<li>Let an older child take the lead by supporting his ideas – for example, say yes if he decides to plan a family meal.</li>
	<li>When your child expresses an opinion, use the conversation as a way to learn more about what she thinks and feels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeating or rephrasing your child’s words, smiling and making eye contact will let him know you’re paying attention when you’re talking or spending time together. These expressions of warmth and interest help your child feel secure and build his confidence.</p>

<h2>Spending ‘quality time’ to build your parent-child relationship</h2>

<p>Positive parent-child relationships are built on quality time. Time together is how you get to know about each other’s experiences, thoughts, feelings and changing interests. This is great for your relationship with your child.</p>

<p><strong>Quality time can happen anytime and anywhere</strong>, in the middle of ordinary days and situations. It can be a shared laugh when you’re bathing your toddler.</p>

<p>When you spend quality time with your child, you’re <strong>showing that you value and appreciate her</strong>. You can take advantage of quality time to communicate powerful positive messages with your smiles, laughter, eye contact, hugs and gentle touches.</p>

<p><strong>Try to plan some regular one-on-one time </strong>with each of your children. Children have different personalities, and some children might seem to need less time than others – but they’ll all benefit from special time with you. On busy work days, you might not have a lot of one-on-one time with your children, but it’s good to have longer interactions when you can.</p>

<p>The time you spend with your child also makes a difference to how he learns. For example, the time you spend talking with your child in the first three years of life helps him learn language.</p>

<h2>Trust, caring and respect in positive parent-child relationships</h2>

<p>Trust and respect are essential to a positive parent-child relationship.</p>

<p>Even in the early years with your baby, developing trust and respect is important. Your baby will feel secure when she learns she can trust her primary carers to meet her needs. Trust and respect become more of a two-way street as your child gets older.</p>

<p>You can nurture trust and respect in your relationship. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be available when your child needs support, care or help, whether it’s picking up your toddler when he falls, or picking up your teenage child when he calls you after a party. This helps him learn to trust that you’ll be there when he needs you.</li>
	<li>Get to know your child and value her for who she is. If she loves football, cheer her on or ask about her favourite players. This shows respect for her feelings and opinions, and also lets her know she can trust you with them.</li>
	<li>Allow the relationship to evolve as your child develops, and his needs and interests change. For example, your preteen child might no longer want you around when he goes to the park with his friends, even though he used to love playing there with you.</li>
	<li>Set up some firm but fair family rules. Rules are clear statements about how your family wants to look after and treat its members. They can help your child trust that you’ll be consistent in the way you treat her.</li>

2326,Newborn behaviour: an overview,"Newborn behaviour – it’s all about cuddling, sleeping, feeding and lots of crying. It isn’t possible to ‘spoil’ a newborn by responding when she cries. Every bit of attention you give now helps your baby grow and develop.","<h2>Understanding your newborn baby’s behaviour</h2>

<p>Cuddling, sleeping, feeding, crying. That’s what newborn behaviour is all about in the first few months.</p>

<p>Although your baby might give you some eye contact, <strong>crying </strong>is probably the main thing you’ll notice about his behaviour. For example, he’ll cry if he’s hungry, unsettled, wet or uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Babies are born with very different temperaments. Some are relaxed and easygoing, and others seem to be more intense and dramatic. Some seem to move constantly, and others are quieter. Some are cheerful most of the time, and others are more serious.</p>

<h2>Newborn crying: what to expect</h2>

<p>Crying is<strong> a newborn’s main way of communicating</strong>, of telling you what she needs. It’s a sound that can spur you into action, even when you’re asleep. If you’re a breastfeeding mother, it can trigger your let-down reflex.</p>

<p>Crying <strong>peaks at about six weeks</strong>. This period of intense newborn crying will pass.</p>

<p>Babies cry and fuss on average for<strong> almost three hours a day</strong>. Some cry for a lot longer than this. Most of this crying and fussing seems to happen in the late afternoon and evening, although every day will probably be a bit different.</p>

<p>As your baby gets older, it’ll be <strong>easier for you to understand what he’s trying to tell you</strong> through crying. His crying is also more likely to be spread throughout the day.</p>

<h2>Understanding and responding to your newborn baby’s behaviour</h2>

<p>Your newborn baby is working out what the world is like. The way you respond to her behaviour, especially her crying, tells her a lot about her world.</p>

<p>For example, your baby might find out that when he cries, someone comes to give him what he needs. This might be a nappy change, a feed or a cuddle. If that happens, he’ll learn that the world is a pretty OK place.</p>

<p>When you<strong> respond quickly to comfort your crying newborn</strong>, your baby will cry less often overall. It’s absolutely fine to pick up your baby when she cries. It tells her that she’s safe because you’re a caring, responsive parent who loves her.</p>

<p>You can’t spoil a newborn. If your newborn is crying, it’s because he needs your help. If you respond calmly and consistently, it helps your baby learn that the world is a safe and predictable place.</p>

<h2>Inconsolable crying or colic</h2>

<p>Some babies cry a lot over a long period of time. Nothing seems to comfort them. This is often called colic.</p>

<p>Colic might just be natural behaviour for some babies, especially at the end of a long day and after too much stimulation. Crying might help a newborn take control of her environment. It’s as if your baby is saying, ‘Enough! I’m just going to cry to shut out the world’.</p>

<p>If your baby cries like this, <strong>it can be very hard for you to cope with</strong>. These ideas might help you and your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce the stimulation around your baby – for example, try sitting with baby in a quiet, dimmed room.</li>
	<li>Lay your baby on his side in his cot and rhythmically pat his back. Gently turn him onto his back if he falls asleep.</li>
	<li>Try putting in some imaginary earplugs. Let the sound of the crying pass through you, and remind yourself that everything is OK. You’re doing all you can to help your baby.</li>
	<li>Take baby for a walk in the pram or a sling. Movement can sometimes be soothing.</li>
	<li>Try playing ‘white noise’ like a fan or the radio tuned to the static between stations. This can help to settle baby.</li>
</ul>

<p>For more ideas, see our illustrated, step-by-step guide to soothing a crying baby.</p>

<h2>When to seek help for newborn behaviour</h2>

<p>All children have the right to be safe and protected. But parenting can be hard work. Seek help if you feel that you can’t cope.  Are there family members or friends who can take a turn at walking your crying baby?  Are there other mothers nearby who can be supports for each other?</p>

<p>Dealing with crying gets easier as your newborn learns more about the world and gets better at showing you what she needs. Also, you’ll become an expert at ‘reading’ your baby’s behaviour. No-one knows your baby better than you, but if you’re <strong>worried about your baby’s crying or you feel like you might hurt your child, talk it through with your health provider or other helping professional</strong>.</p>",3111,56,"43,44,45",59,60,"381, 4411, 4416, 4421, 4426, 4431",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/newborn-behaviour"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/behaviour/understanding-behaviour/newborn-behaviour</a></p>",en,published
2331,Discipline and guiding behaviour: babies and children,"Discipline is about helping your child learn how to behave.Discipline works best if you have a warm and loving relationship with your child.Babies need warm and loving care to feel safe and secure.For toddlers and older children, discipline means setting limits and consequences and encouraging good behaviour.","<h2>About discipline</h2>

<p>Discipline is helping your child learn how to behave – as well as how not to behave. It works best when you have a warm and loving relationship with your child.</p>

<p>Discipline doesn’t mean punishment. In fact, discipline and discipline strategies are positive. They’re built on talking and listening, and they guide children towards:</p>

<ul>
	<li>knowing what behaviour is appropriate, whether it’s at home, a friend’s house, child care, preschool or school</li>
	<li>managing their own behaviour and developing important skills like the ability to get along well with others</li>
	<li>learning to understand, manage and express their feelings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing an approach to discipline</h2>

<p>Choosing an approach to discipline is about <strong>finding the right balance</strong>.</p>

<p>Not enough discipline can leave children feeling insecure and parents feeling out of control. Too much negative discipline, and not enough praise and rewards, might get children behaving well, but out of fear. This can lead to problems with children’s self-esteem and anxiety later in life.</p>

<p>Discipline works best when it’s <strong>firm but fair</strong>. This means you set limits and consequences for your child’s behaviour, while also encouraging good behaviour with praise, rewards and other strategies.</p>

<p>Your approach to discipline will also depend on things like your parenting style, your child’s stage of development and your child’s temperament.</p>

<p>Physical punishment – for example, smacking – doesn’t teach children how to behave. When parents use physical punishment, children are more likely to have challenging behaviour, anxiety or depression. There’s also a risk that smacking might hurt your child.</p>

<h2>Discipline at different ages</h2>

<p>The ways that you use discipline will change depending on what’s happening for your child at different stages of development.</p>

<p><strong>Babies</strong><br />
Babies do things to test their developing skills. They also enjoy making things happen. For example, your baby probably likes getting a reaction when he pulls your hair.</p>

<p>But babies don’t understand consequences. They also don’t know the difference between right and wrong.</p>

<p>This means that <strong>negative consequences, or punishment, don’t work</strong> for babies.</p>

<p>Instead, babies need warm, loving care so they feel secure. So when your baby pulls your hair, you might say ‘no’ and show him how to touch your hair gently. You’ll probably need to do this over and over again because your baby might not remember from one time to the next.</p>

<p>Look for articles on Baby Cues to help you to work out what your baby is trying to tell you through her behaviour and body language.</p>

<p><strong>Toddlers</strong><br />
Toddlers often struggle with big feelings like frustration and anger. Their social and emotional skills are only just starting to develop, and they might be testing out their growing independence.</p>

<p>You can help your child behave well by tuning in to his feelings, changing the environment, distracting him and planning ahead for challenging situations. Our tips and tools for toddler behaviour management explain these and other discipline strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Preschoolers</strong><br />
From the age of three years, most preschoolers start to understand what’s acceptable behaviour and what isn’t. They’ll test out different behaviours, and they might behave in certain ways more than once as they learn about consequences. You can help your preschooler by setting boundaries and being clear about the behaviour you want to see.</p>

<p>Our tips and tools for preschooler behaviour management have information on tailoring discipline strategies to your child’s behaviour.</p>

<h2>Four steps towards discipline and better child behaviour</h2>

<p>Clear expectations for your child’s behaviour are the foundation of discipline for your child. Here’s how to get started.</p>

<p><strong>1. Decide on family rules</strong><br />
A good place to start is with 4-5 family rules. For example, your family rules might be things like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We speak nicely to each other.</li>
	<li>We look after other people.</li>
	<li>Everyone helps out around the house.</li>
	<li>We look after our own belongings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children as young as three can help you make the rules and talk about why your family needs them.</p>

<p><strong>2. Be a role model for the behaviour you expect</strong><br />
Children learn by watching what you do. Showing your child the behaviour you like by doing it yourself will help your child learn. For example, if you want your child to sit down to eat, sitting down together to eat family meals can help children learn this behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>3. Praise your child for good behaviour</strong><br />
Praise is when you tell your child what you like about her or her behaviour. When your child gets praise for behaving well, she’s likely to want to keep behaving well.</p>

<p>Descriptive praise is when you tell your child exactly what it is that you like. It’s best for encouraging good behaviour. For example, ‘Ali, I really like how you used please and thank you just then. Great manners!’</p>

<p><strong>4. Set clear limits and consequences</strong><br />
Decide on a consequence for breaking a family rule. For example, if your eight-year-old hasn’t done his household chores, the consequence might be the loss of pocket money for the week.</p>

<p>When you use consequences in the same way and for the same behaviour every time, your child knows what to expect.</p>",4661,56,"45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"2546, 2551, 2556, 4511, 4516, 4521, 4526, 4531",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/discipline/discipline-strategies"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/discipline/discipline-strategies</a></p>",en,published
2336,Smacking: what you need to know,"Smacking, or spanking, isn’t good for children’s wellbeing and doesn’t help them learn to follow rules.Give your child opportunities to behave well, and use consequences for children over three years old.Learning to manage your own strong feelings can help you avoid hurting your child. Get help if you need it.","<h2>Smacking children: what you need to know</h2>

<p>Smacking is a physical punishment.</p>

<p>Smacking looks like it works because children stop what they’re doing when they get a smack. But <strong>smacking isn’t a good choice for discipline</strong>. That’s because it doesn’t help children learn about self-control or appropriate behaviour.  In fact, being smacked gives a child negative images of herself.  She'll begin to think she is unlovable or just a bad person.</p>

<p>Smacking has <strong>three other big drawbacks</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, there’s a risk that smacking might hurt your child.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, it can give children the message that smacking or hitting other people is an OK way to deal with strong feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, physical punishment like smacking can lead to longer-term problems in children’s health and development. Children who are smacked can become more aggressive than children who aren’t smacked. As they grow, they’re more likely to develop challenging behaviour, anxiety or depression.  You don't want that for your child!</p>

<p>There are better ways than smacking to guide your children towards good behaviour.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to smacking: helping your child behave well</h2>

<p>One of the best ways for parents to avoid situations where they might feel like smacking is to create opportunities for children to behave well.</p>

<p>First, build a loving, secure relationship with your child.  If your child knows, every day, that she is loved and valued, she's more likely to behave in ways that please you.</p>

<p>Having clear family rules is an important step. Rules let your child know what behaviour you expect, preventing many problems before they start.</p>

<p>Does your child have enough to do?  Look at articles on play for simple ideas to keep your child busy, active (in acceptable ways) and learning.</p>

<p>You can also plan ahead to prevent problems in situations where your child tends to behave in challenging ways. For example, wait until after your child has had a nap or a snack before you take her grocery shopping.</p>

<p>If your child is behaving in a way you don’t like, it’s a good idea to look at what’s going on in your child’s environment. Is something worrying or frustrating your child?  Everyone is stressed by Covid19 restrictions, for example.  With very young children, changing the environment may simply mean moving breakable things out of reach so you're not saying 'no"" all the time.</p>

<p>And sometimes just distracting your child in a challenging situation is enough to reduce bad behaviour.</p>

<h2>Using consequences instead of smacking</h2>

<p>Preschoolers may be old enough to respond to logical consequences of their negative behavior--for example, if your child continues to throw her coat on the floor instead of putting it on, you won't be able to go to the park today.  But consequences will only work in the long term when you combine them with positive strategies to encourage good behaviour.</p>

<p>Consequences aren’t recommended for children under three years old, because abies and toddlers are too young to understand that a consequence has happened because of something they did.</p>

<h2>Managing frustration, anger and stress as a parent</h2>

<p>Managing your own feelings is an important part of creating a warm and loving family environment that helps your child behave well.</p>

<p>If you can manage your own angry or frustrated feelings in positive and healthy ways – for example, by staying calm, taking a few deep breaths or calmlywalking away – <strong>you give your child a great example</strong> of how to behave.</p>

<p>If you find yourself getting stressed and angry a lot and you don’t know how to relieve your feelings, it might be worth looking into some stress management and anger management strategies.</p>

<p>And if you feel like smacking your baby or child, put your child in a safe place – for example, a cot – or ask someone else to hold him for a while. Take some time out until you feel calmer. Try going to another room to breathe deeply or calling a family member or friend to talk things through.</p>

<p>If you feel this way a lot, talk to your family health provider or other source of support.</p>

<p>If you’re finding it hard to manage your child’s challenging behaviour, see your family GP or call a parenting hotline for support and advice.</p>

2346,Family rules,"Family rules help everyone in your family get along better.Good family rules are positive, specific and easy to understand.Make rules about things like physical behaviour, safety, manners, routines and respect.Rules will probably need to change as children get older and your family situation changes.","<h2>Family rules: why they’re important</h2>

<p>Family rules are positive statements about how your family wants to look after and treat its members.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rules help children learn what behaviour is and isn’t OK in your family</li>
	<li>Rules help adults be consistent in the way they behave towards children.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules can help everyone in your family get along better. They make family life more positive and peaceful.</p>

<h2>What do good family rules look like?</h2>

<p>Good family rules guide children’s behaviour in a positive way. They:</p>

<ul>
	<li>say exactly what behaviour you expect – for example, ‘We say “please” when we ask for something’</li>
	<li>are easy for children to understand – for example, ‘Use a quiet voice inside the house’</li>
	<li>tell children what to do, rather than what not to do – for example, ‘Put your clothes away’ rather than ‘Don’t be messy’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules that tell your children what not to do are OK sometimes. They’re best when it’s difficult to explain what to do instead – for example, ‘Don’t ask for things in the supermarket’ or ‘Don’t get in a car with a driver you don't know’.</p>

<p>A <strong>short list of positive family rules</strong> is better than a long one, especially for younger children.</p>

<p>Every family’s rules will be different. Your family rules will be influenced by your beliefs and values, your situation and your child’s maturity and needs.</p>

<h2>What to make rules about</h2>

<p>Choose the most important things to make rules about. This might include rules about:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>physical behaviour</strong> towards each other – for example, ‘Be gentle with each other’</li>
	<li><strong>safety</strong> – for example, ‘Wear your seatbelt in the car’</li>
	<li><strong>manners</strong> – for example, ‘We wait until others have finished talking before we talk’</li>
	<li><strong>daily routines</strong> – for example, ‘We take turns setting the table each night’</li>
	<li><strong>respect for each other</strong> – for example, ‘Knock before going into each other’s rooms’.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your culture and values are unique to your family, so your rules may be different. Your children will learn that rules are a part of life, and that there are rules for different places and parts of life, like school, public transport and sport. Making and following family rules can help your children respect the rules in other places too.</p>

<h2>Who to involve in making the rules</h2>

<p>It’s important to involve all members of the family as much as possible when you’re making family rules.</p>

<p>Children as young as three can be part of talking about the rules. As children get older, they can be more involved in deciding what the rules should be.   They'll be <strong>more likely to see the rules as fair and stick to them</strong>.</p>

<p>It can help to write down the rules and display them somewhere everyone can see them. This helps make them clear, and it can also prevent arguments about what is or isn’t allowed. For younger children you can make or draw pictures that show the rules.</p>

<h2>When to review or change the rules</h2>

<p>It’s good to go over your family rules from time to time to check how they’re working. This can also be a good way to remind everyone of the most important rules.</p>

<p>And there will be times when your rules need to change, as your children get older or your family or community situation changes. For example,  if one parent’s work arrangements change, you might make some different rules about helping with household chores.  If pandemic restrictions change, rules about how children may play with others can also change.</p>

<h2>Following the rules: what to expect from children of different ages and abilities</h2>

<p><strong>Preschoolers</strong><br />
Most children aged 3-4 years have the language skills to understand simple rules.</p>

<p>But at this age, children are still developing self-regulation and are likely to forget or ignore rules. They’ll need reminders.  For example, ‘Remember, we sit down to eat’.</p>

<p>And when it comes to safety, rules are important, but it’s best not to rely on them to keep children safe. For example, your rule might be ‘Stay away from the road’, but you still need to always watch your child near roads.</p>

<p><strong>Children with additional needs</strong></p>

<p>In families with children with disabilities or other additional needs, consistent rules send the message that everyone is equal, although adaptations and help may be needed. For example, if your family rule is that you all speak nicely to each other, your child with additional needs may need structured support in meeting this expectation, and extra praise for effort in keeping the rule in mind. </p>

<h2>What to do when children don’t follow the rules</h2>

<p>When children break the rules, you might choose simply to remind them of the rules and give them another chance.</p>

<p>For older preschool children, sometimes it will be more effective to use consequences if rules are frequently broken.  It’s best to talk ahead of time, as a family, about consequences so that everyone understands and agrees.</p>",3096,56,"52,57,58",59,60,"4566, 4571, 546",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/behaviour/rules-consequences/family-rules"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/rules-consequences/family-rules</a></p>",en,published

<p>Tantrums come in all shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>They can involve spectacular explosions of anger, frustration and disorganised behaviour – when your child ‘loses it’.</p>

<p>You might see crying, screaming, stiffening limbs, an arched back, kicking, falling down, flailing about or running away. In some cases, children hold their breath, vomit, break things or get aggressive as part of a tantrum.</p>

<h2>Why tantrums happen</h2>

<p>Tantrums are very common in <strong>children aged 1-3 years</strong>.</p>

<p>This is because children’s social and emotional skills are only just starting to develop at this age. Children often don’t have the words to express big emotions. They might be testing out their growing independence. And they’re discovering that the way they behave can influence the way other people behave.</p>

<p>So tantrums are one of the ways that young children express and manage feelings, and try to understand or change what’s going on around them.</p>

<p><strong>Older children</strong> can have tantrums too. This can be because they haven’t yet learned more appropriate ways to express or manage feelings.</p>

<p>For both <strong>toddlers and older children</strong>, there are things that can make tantrums more likely to happen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Temperament – this influences how quickly and strongly children react to things like frustrating events. Children who get upset easily might be more likely to have tantrums.</li>
	<li>Stress, hunger, tiredness and overstimulation – these can make it harder for children to express and manage feelings and behaviour.</li>
	<li>Situations that children just can’t cope with – for example, a toddler might have trouble coping if an older child takes a toy away.</li>
	<li>Strong emotions – worry, fear, shame and anger can be overwhelming for children.</li>
</ul>

<p>Self-regulation is the ability to understand and manage behaviour and reactions. Children start developing it from around 12 months. As your child gets older, they’ll be more able to regulate reactions and calm down when something upsetting happens. You’ll see fewer tantrums as a result.</p>

<h2>How to make toddler tantrums less likely</h2>

<p>There are things you can do to make tantrums less likely to happen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce stress. Tired, hungry and overstimulated children are more likely to experience tantrums.</li>
	<li>Tune in to your child’s feelings. If you’re aware of your child’s feelings, you might be able to sense when big feelings are on the way. You can talk about what’s going on and help your child manage difficult feelings. You might also be able to distract your child.</li>
	<li>Identify tantrum triggers. For example, your child might have tantrums when you’re shopping. You might be able to plan for this situation or change the environment to avoid tantrums. For example, it might help to go shopping after your child has had a nap and a snack.</li>
	<li>Talk about emotions with your child. When your child struggles with a strong feeling, encourage your child to name the feeling and what caused it. For example, ‘Did you throw your toy because you were cross that it wasn’t working? What else could you have done?’</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to handle toddler tantrums when they happen</h2>

<p>Sometimes tantrums happen, no matter what you do to avoid them. Here are some ideas for handling tantrums when they happen:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stay calm (or pretend to!). Take a moment for yourself if you need to. If you get angry, it’ll make the situation harder for both you and your child. When you speak, keep your voice calm and level, and act deliberately and slowly.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge your child’s strong feelings. For example, ‘It’s very upsetting when your ice-cream falls out of the cone, isn’t it?’ This can help prevent behaviour getting more out of control and gives your child a chance to reset emotions.</li>
	<li>Wait out the tantrum. Stay close so your child knows you’re there. But don’t try to reason with your child or distract them. It’s too late once a tantrum has started.</li>
	<li>Take charge when you need to. If the tantrum happens because your child wants something, don’t give your child what they want. If your child doesn’t want to do something, use your judgment. For example, if your child doesn’t want to get out of the bath, pulling out the plug might be safer than lifting out your child.</li>
	<li>Be consistent and calm in your approach. If you sometimes give your child what they want when they have tantrums and you sometimes don’t, the problem could get worse.</li>
</ul>

<p>When your child behaves well, reward them with lots of enthusiastic praise – for example, when your child names a strong emotion like ‘cross’, or your child calms down before a tantrum starts.</p>

<h2>Tantrums in preschoolers and early school-age children</h2>

<p>You can use <strong>all of the tips above</strong> to help with tantrums in preschoolers and early school-age children.</p>

<p>At this age, children are also better able to understand that their actions have effects. This means that you can sometimes use consequences to manage your child’s behaviour.</p>

<p>It’s important to make sure you <strong>don’t accidentally reward tantrums</strong>. For example, if your child has a tantrum because you say no to buying a lolly but then you buy the lolly, this rewards the tantrum. Shouting or pleading with your child when they have tantrums can also be a reward, because it gives your child attention.</p>

<p>If your child has additional needs like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), they might have frequent or severe tantrums. See our article on challenging behaviour in children with ASD or ask for advice from the professionals who work with your child.</p>

<h2>Coping with tantrums</h2>

<p>Dealing with tantrums can be very draining and stressful. You might feel you need to step in to end a tantrum straight away. But if it’s safe, it can help to take a breather while you decide how to respond.</p>

<p>Here are ideas for staying calm and keeping things in perspective:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop a strategy for tantrums. Have a clear plan for how you’ll handle a tantrum in whatever situation you’re in. Concentrate on putting your plan into action when the tantrum happens.</li>
	<li>Accept that you can’t control your child’s emotions or behaviour directly. You can only keep your child safe and guide their behaviour so tantrums are less likely to happen in the future.</li>
	<li>Accept that it takes time for change to happen. Your child has a lot of growing up to do before tantrums are gone forever. Developing and practising self-regulation skills is a life-long task.</li>
	<li>Beware of thinking that your child is doing it on purpose or is trying to upset you. Children don’t have tantrums deliberately – they’re stuck in a bad habit or just don’t have the skills right now to cope with the situation.</li>
	<li>Keep your sense of humour. But don’t laugh at the tantrum – if you do, it might reward your child with attention. It might also upset your child even more if they think you’re laughing at them.</li>
	<li>If other people give you dirty looks, ignore them. They’ve either never had children or it’s been so long since they had a young child that they’ve forgotten what it’s like.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t judge yourself as a parent based on how many tantrums your child has. Remember that all children have tantrums. Instead, focus on how you respond to the tantrums. And remember that you’re only human and part of parenting is learning as you go.</p>

2391,"Family violence: effects on parents, children and families","If you’re experiencing family violence, it can affect your parenting and your relationships with your children. Family violence between parents is traumatic for children, even if they don’t see it, hear it or experience it directly.
The person using family violence is responsible for the effects of violence on your children and family relationships.
Families experiencing family violence need support. Start by talking to someone you trust, like a friend, family member or GP.","<h2>Family violence and family relationships</h2>

<p>If you’re experiencing family violence, it can hurt you in many ways – physically, mentally, socially, emotionally, sexually and more.</p>

<p>And if you’re <strong>a parent experiencing family violence</strong>, family violence might also affect the relationship that you have with your children. It can affect your ability to give your children the love and attention they need.</p>

<p>If this is your situation, it’s important to know that <strong>family violence is never your fault</strong>. The person using family violence is responsible for it and the way it affects your family.</p>

<h2>How family violence between parents affects parents and children</h2>

<p>Family violence can harm your ability to parent and your relationship with your children in several ways.</p>

<p>This can happen if <strong>emotional abuse is used to undermine your relationship with your children</strong>. For example, your partner or ex-partner might use family violence to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>say nasty things about you to your children to turn them against you</li>
	<li>force your children to call you names or disobey you</li>
	<li>prevent you from spending quality time with your children.</li>
</ul>

<p>Family violence might also affect your <strong>mental health</strong>. It’s common for people experiencing family violence to also experience depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep problems, and self-medication with alcohol or other drugs.</p>

<p>And if you’re having mental health issues like these, it can be <strong>harder for you to deal with the challenges of parenting</strong>. For example, it might be really hard for you to:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>manage daily activities like feeding children, getting them to school and playing with them</li>
	<li>find the interest and energy to tune in to your children and their needs</li>
	<li>be patient and understanding with your children</li>
	<li>use positive behaviour strategies to guide your children’s behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p>And family violence in the form of physical abuse can cause injuries that make it <strong>difficult for you to care for your children’s everyday needs</strong>. For example, if you have a broken bone or other serious injury, you might not be able to do things like bathing, changing nappies, or cooking meals for your children.</p>

<p>If you’re experiencing family violence, it might affect your ability to look after your children’s needs in the way you want to. But this doesn’t make you a bad parent. It’s always the responsibility of the person using violence to stop.</p>

<h2>How family violence between parents affects children</h2>

<p>Family violence between parents is <strong>traumatic for children</strong>.</p>

<p>Children often know that family violence is going on between parents. And even if they don’t see it, hear it or experience it directly, they’re still affected by it. For example, just knowing that your partner is hurting you is distressing and traumatic for children.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>seeing the effects of violence</strong> is traumatic for your children. For example, children can be deeply affected by:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>  seeing a parent’s injuries or hearing a parent being abused</li>
	<li>helping or caring for a parent after the parent has been abused</li>
	<li>going to the doctor or hospital with a parent after the parent has been abused.</li>
</ul>

<p>Growing up with family violence can affect children and their development in the short and long term. That’s because children exposed to family violence might have:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>behaviour problems like aggression, lack of emotional control and disobedience</li>
	<li>social problems like difficulties talking to or playing with other children</li>
	<li>sadness and withdrawal from friends and family</li>
	<li>trouble eating</li>
	<li>bedwetting, nightmares and trouble sleeping</li>
	<li>mood disorders like depression and anxiety</li>
	<li>learning difficulties</li>
	<li>low school attendance</li>
	<li>problems at school like bullying</li>
	<li>difficulty making friends or falling out with old friends.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to do if you’re experiencing family violence</h2>

<p>If you or your children are in immediate danger, <strong>call the police</strong>.</p>

<p>If you need support for you or your children, you have a few options:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Speak to your doctor, child and family health nurse or a school counsellor.</li>
	<li>Call to the telephone support service available in your country.</li>
	<li>Speak to a trusted family member or friend for support.</li>
</ul>

<p>With help, you can limit the effects of family violence on your children. You can be the parent you want to be and help your children grow into resilient adults who can have positive relationships. If you’re experiencing family violence, there are people out there who understand and can help you and your children.</p>",5441,3,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"4656, 4661, 4666, 4671, 4676, 4681",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/safety-and-security/family-violence-effects"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/first-1000-days/safety-and-security/family-violence-effects</a></p>",en,published
2396,When you feel you might hurt your child,"All children have the right to be safe and protected from child abuse. But being a parent can feel overwhelming sometimes. If you think you can’t cope and you might hurt your child, you need to get help.","<h2>Children and parents at risk of child abuse</h2>

<p>As a parent, it’s normal to feel tested to your limits sometimes. But sometimes it can be worse than this.</p>

<p>If you feel very tired, frustrated by your child’s challenging behaviour or worried about whether you’re doing the right thing, it can be hard to control your emotions and reactions. Not having enough support can also stretch your patience and ability to cope.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might be worn down by personal, emotional, medical or financial problems, and feel you can’t care for your child properly.</p>

<p>Or you might have had difficult experiences in your own past, like an unhappy childhood or a lack of family support. These past experiences can make it challenging for you as a parent.</p>

<p>If things have got out of control for you and you get angry with your child – verbally or physically – you risk harming your child, even if you don’t mean to.</p>

<p>It’s never OK to harm a child. Every child has the right to be safe and protected.</p>

<h2>What to do</h2>

<p>If you feel like you might hurt your child, here’s what to do.</p>

<p>Right now:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Stop.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Walk away</strong> and take some deep breaths.</li>
	<li><strong>Call someone</strong> to talk you through the moment, like a family member, a friend or a parenting helpline.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you’re calmer:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Think about</strong> what has happened and how it’s affecting you and your child.</li>
	<li><strong>Do</strong> something to improve the situation.</li>
	<li><strong>Find support</strong> to make the changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel you might hurt your child, or you have hurt your child, it’s important to seek help immediately, if your child needs medical assistance, call an ambulance.</p>

<h2>Getting support to avoid child abuse</h2>

<p>If you feel like you might hurt your child and you’ve recognised these feelings, you can take steps to avoid this risk.</p>

<p>Here are some <strong>people who can help you</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>counsellors on parenting hotlines</li>
	<li>family support services in your area </li>
	<li>your doctor</li>
	<li>a psychologist or counsellor – your doctor should be able to suggest professionals if you don’t know of any yourself</li>
	<li>your social worker</li>
	<li>family violence support services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Asking for help takes courage</strong>, but it also shows that you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>love your child and have his best interests at heart</li>
	<li>realise there’s a problem</li>
	<li>are taking responsibility</li>
	<li>want things to change for your family</li>
	<li>are committed to improving things.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might help to know that you’re not the only parent who has faced tough times. Every doctor, psychologist, counsellor, social worker and hotline operator has spoken to, and helped, someone just like you.</p>

<p>Professionals can work with you and give you ideas on ways to be a more positive parent.

2401,Sun safety for babies and children,"Too much sun can lead to sunburn, skin damage, eye damage, skin cancer and a weakened immune system.Simple sun safety precautions can minimise the risks of sun exposure. Sun safety for kids is about timing, shade, protective clothing and sunscreen. Sun-safe role-modelling is important too.","<h2>Sun safety: why it’s important</h2>

<p>Too much sun can lead to sunburn, skin damage, eye damage, skin cancer and a weakened immune system.</p>

<p>Your child needs some sun to help her body to make vitamin D, which is important for things like strong bones and muscles. But you have to <strong>be careful about how much sun</strong> your child gets on her skin.</p>

<h2>Sun safety at different times of year and day</h2>

<p>Your child’s sun protection needs change at different times of year and different times of day. That’s because ultraviolet (UV) radiation varies during the year depending on the season.</p>

<p>UV radiation levels are highest between about 9 am and 4 pm, depending on where you are and the time of year. Your child needs sun protection if he’s in the sun when the <strong>UV radiation level is 3 or above</strong>.</p>

<p>You can check the UV levels for your area using the meteorological UV reports.</p>

<p>In summer, it’s best to go to the playground, the park or the beach in the early morning and late afternoon.</p>

<h2>Shade</h2>

<p>Shade gives you and your child some protection from UV radiation. Dense shade that creates a dark shadow is best.</p>

<p>But UV can still reach you in the shade. So even if you’re sitting in the shade, make sure you and your child wear protective clothing, including sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat. Use sunscreen on any exposed skin.</p>

<p>If you’re using a pram, cover it with a shade cloth that lets air get through to your child. Alternatively, some prams have adjustable canopy tops that can move and offer shade as the sun’s position changes.</p>

<p>If you can’t find shade, make your own using an umbrella or sunshade. Always keep window shades in your car to stick on side windows and protect your child while you’re driving.</p>

<p>You can be exposed to UV radiation even if it isn’t a sunny day. This means you can get burned on a cloudy or cool day, or if sun reflects on to you from buildings, water, sand or snow.</p>

<h2>Protective clothing, hats and sunglasses</h2>

<p>Here are some things to think about when you’re looking for sun-protective clothing for your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Tightly woven fabric</strong> helps protect your child’s skin from the sun. Hold the fabric up to the light to see how much sun gets through. If the fabric lets a lot of light through, it’ll probably let a lot of UV through too.</li>
	<li>Long sleeves and long pants cover up more of your child’s skin. Elbow-length sleeves and knee-length shorts are best if it’s too warm for full-length clothing.</li>
	<li>Wetsuits and rash vests are a great way to protect your child from the sun when she’s swimming or doing other water activities.</li>
	<li>Cotton clothing is cooler than clothing made from acrylic fibres.</li>
	<li>Loose-fitting clothing is cooler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look out for sun-protective clothing with an <strong>ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating of 50+</strong>. This rating gives your child the best available protection from the sun.</p>

<p><strong>Hats</strong><br />
A hat protects your child’s face, neck and ears from the sun’s UV. Bucket, broad-brimmed and legionnaire’s hats give the best protection. Caps aren’t recommended.</p>

<p>For babies, look for a soft hat so that your baby can still lie down comfortably while he’s wearing it. Straps will help keep the hat on your baby’s head. You can tie long straps or straps with toggles behind your baby’s head, or trim long straps so that they don’t become a choking hazard.</p>

<p>Many babies and toddlers don’t like wearing hats – keep trying and eventually hats will become part of your child’s routine.</p>

<p><strong>Sunglasses</strong><br />
Wearing sunglasses as well as a hat can help protect your child’s eyes. Look for close-fitting, wrap-around sunglasses. Prolonged exposure to UV is a risk factor for cataracts.</p>

<p>Check your child’s position, hat and clothing regularly to make sure she’s out of the direct sunlight.</p>

<h2>Sunscreen</h2>

<p>Use a <strong>sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or higher, broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen</strong> on your child’s face, hands and any other parts of his skin that aren’t covered by clothes. Make sure to use plenty of sunscreen – many people don’t use enough, so they don’t get the protection they need.</p>

<p>Apply sunscreen at least 20 minutes before you go outside, and reapply it every two hours, even if the tube or bottle says four hours.</p>

<p>Make sure sunscreen is within its use-by date, and keep it stored in a cool, shady place under 30°C.</p>

<p>Remember that sunscreen filters UV radiation, but doesn’t completely block it out. You need to <strong>seek shade and put your child in sun-protective clothing too</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sunscreen and babies</strong><br />
If your child is less than six months of age, it’s best not to put sunscreen on her regularly – shade, clothing and hats are the most important way to protect her.</p>

<p>Sunscreens labelled ‘for babies’ or ‘sensitive’ are less likely to cause skin irritation. Always test the sunscreen on a small area of your baby’s skin to check for any skin reactions.</p>

<h2>Role-modelling</h2>

<p>You are your child’s most important role model, and your child copies what you do. If you take sun safety precautions yourself, your child is more likely to do it too.</p>",2246,3,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"4711, 4716, 4721, 4726",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/safety/outdoor-sun-safety/sun-safety"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/safety/outdoor-safety/sun-safety</a></p>",en,published
2406,Internet safety: children 3-5 years,"There are three kinds of internet safety risks for preschoolers – content, contact and conduct. 
Practical ways to keep your preschooler safe include a family media plan, child-friendly search engines, reviews, privacy settings and parental controls.
It’s important to go online with your child, role-model safe internet use, and teach your child about good and bad content.","<h2>Why internet safety matters</h2>

<p>Preschoolers like going online to look at videos or to play games. They can do this using computers, mobile phones, tablets, TVs and other devices.</p>

<p><strong>There are safety risks for preschoolers online</strong>, although preschoolers won’t usually be exposed to as many risks as older children because they’re less likely to be using the internet independently.</p>

<p>When you take some practical internet safety precautions, you protect your child from risky or inappropriate content and activities. And <strong>your child gets to make the most of her online experience</strong>, with its potential for learning, exploring, being creative and connecting with family and friends.</p>

<h2>Internet safety risks for preschoolers</h2>

<p>There are three main kinds of internet safety risks for children:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li><strong>Content risks</strong>: these risks include content that children might find upsetting, disgusting or otherwise uncomfortable. Examples are pornography, violence, images of cruelty to animals or programs meant for older children.</li>
	<li><strong>Contact risks</strong>: these risks include children coming into contact with people they don’t know. For example, a child might use a communication app and talk to a stranger.</li>
	<li><strong>Conduct risks</strong>: these risks include children acting in ways that might hurt others. For example, a child might destroy a game his friend or sibling has created. Accidentally making in-app purchases is another conduct risk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Protecting your child from internet safety risks: tips</h2>

<p>You play a key role in reducing the risks that your child is exposed to on the internet. There are many practical things you can do to help your preschooler stay safe while she’s online.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Use digital media and the internet with your child or make sure you’re close by and aware of what your child is doing online. This way you can act quickly if your child is concerned or upset by something he’s seen.</li>
	<li>Create a family media plan. Your plan could cover things like screen-free areas in your house, internet safety rules like not giving out personal information, and the programs, games and apps that are OK for your child to use.</li>
	<li>Use child-friendly search engines like Kiddle, or content providers like ABC Kids, CBeebies, YouTube Kids or KIDOZ.</li>
	<li>Check that games, websites and TV programs are appropriate for your child. For example, you can look at reviews on Common Sense Media.</li>
	<li>Make sure older siblings follow your internet safety rules when they go online with your preschooler. Rules might include watching only age-appropriate programs.</li>
	<li>Set up a folder with bookmarks for your child’s favourite apps or websites so that she can easily find them. You can set up folders and bookmarks on all the devices that your child uses.</li>
	<li>Check privacy settings, use parental controls, block in-app purchases, and disable one-click payment options and location services on your devices.</li>
	<li>Find out how to make complaints about offensive online content.</li>
</ul>

<p>As your child gets older and more confident and starts to use the internet independently, you’ll need to review your strategies. Our article on internet safety for children aged 6-8 years has tips.</p>

<h2>Teaching safe and responsible online behaviour</h2>

<p>You can help your child learn how to use digital media and the internet safely, responsibly and enjoyably. If you teach your child how to manage internet safety risks and worrying experiences for himself, he’ll build <strong>digital resilience</strong>. This is the ability to deal with and respond positively to any risks he encounters online.</p>

<p>You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>going online with your child</li>
	<li>being a good role model</li>
	<li>teaching your child about good and bad content</li>
	<li>teaching your child about in-app purchases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Going online with your child</h2>

<p>Your child will get more out of being online if you’re watching or playing with her. You can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>get her to show you websites that are fun or interesting</li>
	<li>ask her to show you how to play the app or game that she’s playing</li>
	<li>talk about the videos she’s watching.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think the app or video isn’t appropriate, you could say, ‘This is a bit grown-up. Let’s find something else’. Then help your child to find something more appropriate.</p>

<h2>Being a good role model</h2>

<p>Your child learns from you. This means you can model safe and healthy internet use by using digital media in the way you want your child to use it now and in the future. For example, you can keep internet-connected devices out of bedrooms.</p>

<p>It’s also a good idea to find out how grandparents and other people in your child’s life use the internet and try to agree on a shared approach.</p>

<h2>Teaching your child about good and bad content</h2>

<p><strong>You can explain to your child that there’s good and bad content on the internet</strong>, including content that isn’t true. Encourage your child to talk to you if he sees something upsetting, scary or worrying. For example, you could say, ‘Some videos on the internet can be upsetting or scary. Tell me if you see something that scares you or makes you unhappy’.</p>

<h2>Teaching your child about in-app purchases</h2>

<p>Lots of games and apps have in-app purchases for things like character costumes and new levels. You could teach your child about these by saying something like, ‘People use the internet to make money and we have to be careful that we don’t give them our money by mistake. If something pops up on the screen don’t click it. Come and tell me’.</p>

<p>It’s OK if your rules are different from those of other families. If you’ve thought them through and you’re happy with the way they’re working, you’re helping to keep your child safe online.</p>",1316,3,"52,57,58",59,60,"336, 341, 3531",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/play-learning/screen-time-healthy-screen-use/internet-safety-3-5-years"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/preschoolers/safety/online-safety/internet-safety-3-5-years</a></p>",en,published

3341,Optimal nutrition during the first 6 months,"""Your milk is the only food and fluid that your baby needs in the first six months of life. The World Health Organization and UNICEF recommend exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months and continued breastfeeding up to two years with the introduction of adequate and safe food from 6th month.""","<p>Breast milk is a complex nourishing fluid that contains fats, proteins, sugars, vitamins, minerals, antibodies, enzymes, water and many other ingredients in exactly the ratio and amount needed to ensure optimal growth and development of the baby. Breast milk provides antibodies that give babies everywhere a healthy boost and protect them against many infections. The benefits of breastfeeding begin at the earliest age and last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Your milk is always available, hygienically correct, appropriate temperatures, free of charge.It is specially adapted to the needs of your child and changes from day to day, from month to month, from breastfeeding to breastfeeding, to meet the child's needs.</p>

<p>By breastfeeding, you encourage your baby's psycho-motor development. You shorten your postpartum recovery and reduce the risk of some diseases later in life. Breastfeeding is far more than just eating. During breastfeeding, a strong bond is established between mother and baby and the baby's need for love, warmth and security is met in a unique way. </p>

<p>Risks of unnecessary supplementation<br />
Babies need a very small amount of milk at first. As the need for the amount of milk grows, by frequent sucking, the baby stimulates production of milk and provides the amount of milk she needs. Unnecessary supplementation can cause the child to no longer want to suck because of the feeling of fullness in the stomach. The milk supply will decrease, or your breasts will become full and hard. If supplementation is used to calm the baby, it can undermine your confidence that you will be able to breastfeed your baby successfully. </p>

<h3>How do I know if my baby is getting enough milk?</h3>

<p><br />
A baby is for sure getting enough milk if:<br />
- s/he is sucking at least 8-12 times during the day;<br />
- s/he is sucking rhythmically with short pauses, chin movements can be seen, swallowing can be heard;<br />
- wets diapers 6 or more times in 24 hours with pale, diluted urine;<br />
- has usually 3-6 stools in 24 hours;<br />
- has gained weight, an average of 150-240 g per week for the first 4 months;<br />
- s/he is active between breastfeeding, lively. </p>

<h3>Weight gain</h3>

<p><br />
In the first days after birth, it is normal for a newborn to lose weight, an average of 7% of its birth weight. When lactation is established and breastfeeding starts well, the child begins to gain weight, on average 25 to 30 grams per day. Babies usually regain their birth weight between the 10th and 15th day of life. Babies who progress well usually gain a minimum of 600gr per month. Of course, some children progress much more; if the baby is just sucking, you should not be afraid that she is gaining too much weight. </p>

<h3>Natural nutrition of a sick child</h3>

<p><br />
All newborns can be fed breast milk. The exceptions are very rare congenital metabolic disorders. Some babies such as premature babies or children on mechanical ventilation cannot suck. Children with cleft palate, heart defects, neurological or genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, may have difficulty sucking. In these situations, the child can be fed breast milk, in a way that best suits his condition, until he is able to suckle. </p>

<p>Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months helps a baby to thrive. Breast milk is the best healthy first food for your baby and is sufficient to support your child’s healthy growth and development.</p>",2511,1,"43,44,45,46",59,60,"5371, 4941, 4936, 2681",,0,1,"<p><a href=""https://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Key_Message_Booklet_2012_small.pdf"">UNICEF The Community Infant and Young Child Feeding Key Message Booklet 2012.pdf</a></p>

Therefore, it is important to plan daily activities in accordance with the child`s age and needs.</p>

<p><strong>Children under 12 months: </strong> </p>

<ul>
	<li>Infants should be physically active several times a day in a variety of ways. They should spend <strong><em>at least 30 minutes</em></strong> in interactive floor-based play, younger ones in prone position, </li>
	<li>The position of relative rest: in a pram, high chair, carrier, or on your body is not recommended to last longer than 1 hour. This time should be used for stimulating activities such as talking, singing, reading to a child, joint sightseeing.</li>
	<li>In this period exposure of children to screens is not recommended (television, tablet, mobile phone).</li>
	<li>The time child spends sleeping, daytime and night time, changes over time. For the youngest age from 0 to 3 months it may last 14–17 hours, while in the next period from 4 to 11 months of age it shortens a bit and lasts 12–16 hours</li>

<p>Even at this age, breast milk remains the most important food for infants and provides half of the baby’s energy needs. Continue breastfeeding your baby on demand both day and night.  Solid foods cannot replace milk during the first year of life. There is no need to give infant formula or follow-up formulas (which are specially formulated milks for older children from 6 months of age), as breastmilk with a diversified diet provides all the nutrients your child needs. Remember to breastfeed first before giving other foods.</p>

<p><strong>When giving complementary foods to your baby, there are six important things to consider: </strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Feed your baby complementary foods 3 times a day</li>
	<li><strong>Amount:</strong> Start with 2–3 tablespoonful at each meal at 6 months, increasing gradually to 1/2 cup, at each meal</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness:</strong> Give mashed/pureed family foods. By 8 months, your baby can begin eating finger foods</li>
	<li><strong>Variety:</strong> Try to feed a variety of foods at each meal. For example: Animal-source foods (flesh meats, eggs and dairy products), staples (grains, roots and tubers), legumes and seeds and vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables (carrot, spinach) and other fruits and vegetables (zucchini).
	<ul>
		<li>Animal source foods are very important. Start animal source foods as early and as often as possible and give daily. Cook well and chop fine. Infants can eat well-cooked and finely chopped eggs, meat and fish even if they don’t have teeth.</li>
		<li>Mashed foods and porridges should include a mixture of grains, vegetables, beans, root vegetables and, meat – beef, fish, poultry, egg, fruits, vegetables, if possible. You can add milk to these porridges. Thick foods are richer in energy and vitamins and will nourish your child better than watery foods (like soup). The infant has great energy and nutritional needs and a small stomach capacity. It is important that the food has a great nutritional value to the child in such a small amount.</li>
		<li>Additional snacks (extra food between meals) such as fruit can be offered once or twice per day. </li>
		<li>If your baby has been exclusively breastfed, he should start drinking water with the beginning of a non-dairy diet. Water needs depend on the age of the child, the number of meals, the amount and type of solid food. Offer your child water more often, especially after a meal! Give water from a cup. In the first year, boiled and cooled water is recommended.</li>
		<li>Please limit or do not give your child sugary foods (such as cookies or biscuits), fried snacks, juice, tea or soda. Avoid giving sugary drinks</li>
		<li>If you prepare food for the baby that has oil or fat in it, use no more than half a teaspoon per day.</li>
		<li>Each week you can add one new food to your child’s diet</li>
		<li>Use iodized salt</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Responsive feeding:</strong>  Be patient and actively encourage your baby to eat. Don’t force your baby to eat. Use a separate plate to make sure young child eats all the food given.
	<ul>
		<li>Observe your baby and react to his signals. Feed the child slowly and patiently, following his / her rhythm. Try different combinations of foods, flavors and textures to encourage your child to eat their meal. Wait for the child to stop eating before offering it again.</li>
		<li>Stop the feeding when the child shows he had enough.</li>
		<li>As he grows, the child gradually develops the skills necessary for independence in nutrition (taking pieces of food and offering them by mouth, choosing food, using cutlery).</li>
		<li>Establish predictable routines for meals and snacks. Limit mealtime to 15-20 minutes. Feed the child exclusively in a highchair at the table.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Good hygiene (cleanliness) is important to avoid diarrhea and other illnesses. Use a clean spoon or cup to give foods or liquids to your baby. Store the foods to be given to your baby in a safe hygienic place. Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing foods and feeding baby. Wash your hands and your baby’s hands before eating. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet and washing or cleaning baby’s bottom.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Foods to avoid in the first year of life</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not give honey to a child in the 1st year of life      </li>
	<li>Cow's milk (as well as goat's, sheep's) is not recommended in the first year of life, because its composition does not meet the needs of infants and can contribute to the development of anemia. A small amount of cow's milk can be used to prepare porridge.         </li>
	<li>Avoid citrus fruits (lemon, orange, mandarin) in the first year.         </li>
	<li>Do not add salt or spices to baby food.         </li>
	<li>Always take care of the child's safety: do not give the infant peanuts, popcorn, small fruits or whole grapes, pieces of solid food that can choke.         </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The way a baby is fed </strong></p>

<p>It is important that the child is fed variety of foods at each meal. This would include starting off with thick porridge, and gradually adding to the porridge one type of vegetable puree (pumpkin, carrot, cauliflower, white, brussels sprouts) or adding fruit puree (apple, banana, pears, peaches). After that you could move onto mashed/puree meat (low-fat beef, lamb, horse meat, pork, chicken, turkey) or beans with vegetables. Your child may like some items more than others, encourage your child to try different foods.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don’t restrict foods for your child, since your child needs a variety of foods (i.e. protein, fruits and vegetables, a little fat (i.e. vegetable oil), and grains/cereals in the diet)</li>
	<li>If your child develops an allergy to a food, you can remove that food item.</li>
	<li>If you have a family history of allergy, in this case, you can gradually introduce one food /day over a one week to 10-day period.</li>

<p>From the 9th to the 12th month, most children are skillful enough to eat alone and drink from a cup they hold with both hands. Encourage the independence of your little one!</p>

<p>An infant has an innate, evolutionarily acquired affinity for sweet (especially!) And salty. The rejection of bitter food is also innate, which makes it difficult to introduce green leafy vegetables. Offer it first in combination with vegetables that the child is already used to (potatoes, carrots).</p>

<p>If the child does not immediately accept a new food, do not give it up. Arm yourself with patience; sometimes he needs to be offered with it up to ten times to get used to its smell and taste.</p>

<p>When a meal is accompanied by patience, smiles, encouragement and respect for the needs of the child, you encourage learning and acquiring skills, and feeding time becomes a time for enjoyment and pleasure.</p>

3371,General recommendations for children with weight loss,"<p>Weight loss (or insufficient weight gain), of varying degrees, can occur at any time in a child's life, and is most often a result of illness and/or malnutrition. Appropriate meal preparation, offering high-quality food more frequently and a parent-child relationship in accordance with the child's needs will make it possible to gradually compensate for the loss (insufficient gain).</p>","<p>Weight loss, or growth in length/height that is not accompanied by corresponding weight gain in a child, is most often a result of illness and/or malnutrition. Knowing that optimal nutrition during early childhood is essential for the development of a child's full potential, you will try to address this disorder yourself.</p>

<p>Here are some useful recommendations that will help you make the necessary corrections or apply them before visiting the pediatrician.  </p>

<h2>During illness</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If the child is in the second year and fed breastmilk, be assured that he/she will ask to suckle more often and breastfeeds will be shorter - respond to his/her need.   </li>
	<li>The child has a weaker appetite and will eat less, but it is vital that he/she gets a sufficient amount of fluids.</li>
	<li>Prepare and often offer your child a variety of foods, of softer consistencies (soups, broths, vegetable potages, pieces of fresh melon, watermelon...) and make sure that these are his/her favorite dishes.</li>
	<li>Between meals, offer him/her fluids, preferably just water, even in small sips, in an amount that is larger than usual because the losses are higher (through stool, skin, breathing).  </li>
	<li>Monitor your child's behavior and respond to his/her needs: give him/her fluids or food in the amount he/she can handle.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>After illness or a period of insufficient food intake</h2>

<p>(or other economic or social-emotional reasons):</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is necessary to encourage the child to eat more and/or more often until he/she regains the lost weight and continues to grow normally.</li>
	<li>If the child is younger than 2 years and fed breastmilk, it is necessary to continue breastfeeding in accordance with the child's needs, probably more frequently.</li>
	<li>Pay attention to the recommendations for optimal nutrition in accordance with the child's age, but have in mind that your child's needs are greater at this time. </li>
	<li>To adequately respond to the child's increased nutritional needs, ensure a high-quality protein diet: various types of meat, fish, poultry, eggs and legumes (peas, beans, lentils) combined with cereals will do; the child will thus get the necessary intake of minerals - iron and zinc.</li>
	<li>It is necessary to prepare higher-energy-density food; therefore, add a teaspoonful of oil or a butter cube to purées (semolina, cornmeal porridge, cereals).</li>
	<li>Continue to feed your child fresh fruits and vegetables that are locally available.</li>
	<li>Prepare food in the  way it is usually prepared in the family.  </li>
	<li>Do not deny food to your child, but avoid offering: additional milk formulas, sweetened fluids and foods (juices with added sugar, carbonated drinks, cakes, sweets...), fried foods, which are unhealthy, fill the stomach and provide energy, but not other necessary and useful nutrients.   </li>
</ul>

			<p>Recommendations for infants<br />
			The best food for an infant is breast milk, which contains all the necessary nutrients in a balanced ratio. Therefore, it is recommended as an exclusive food in the first 6 months and further with the introduction of non-dairy foods. </p>

			<p>Recommendations for children older than 6 months<br />
			Make sure that your child, if he is older than 6 months, has other meals in quantity and frequency that is in accordance with the valid recommendations for optimal nutrition. If that is not the case, make the necessary adjustments. Follow the recommendation not to sweeten the food you give to the child, and limit the daily amount of natural juice that you give to the child older than 6 months to 90 ml, maximum 120 ml. Do not add salt to the food you give your child. <br />
			Pay attention to the way you feed your child. Do not force him to eat all the food you have prepared, but respect his feeling of satiety. Encourage him to eat on his own, out of hand, because then he knows best when he has had enough. Encourage your child's movement and physical activity and create conditions for at least 30 minutes of interactive play, in various positions on the floor. Give him a good night's sleep of 12 to 17 hours, depending on his age and needs. Applying the recommendations for proper nutrition and physical activity of the child from his earliest age, increases his chances for a healthy and successful life.</p>

Overweight leads to numerous health problems throughout life and should be detected and addressed timely.,"<p>Excess body weight most often occurs as a consequence of excessive food intake or insufficient physical activity, rarely genetic disorders. Changes in the environment and in the way the child is cared for could also affect body weight and need to be carefully considered. Overweight leads to numerous health problems: bone and joint deformities, heart and blood vessel diseases, endocrine diseases, depression, low self-esteem and lower academic achievement later in life and it is important to detect this excess in time and take measures to return body weight to typical growth trends. <br />
If you see that your child has started to gain excess weight, you can take him to the doctor/pediatrician for a check-up, maybe a more detailed examination, but there are some measures that you can take yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for the small child:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure your child has the adequate number of meals and food intake that is in quantity and content in accordance with the recommendations for the optimal age-appropriate diet;</li>
	<li>Encourage him to eat more colorful vegetables (especially dark green, red and orange) and variety of fresh fruits;</li>
	<li>You can give  natural fruit juice only as part of a meal and not in a larger amount than 120 -180 ml;</li>
	<li>Offer the child clean water when he is thirsty instead of sweetened liquids (sweetened teas, carbonated drinks, juices);</li>
	<li>Choose to give breads, pastas and cereals made out of whole grain;</li>
	<li>Choose healthy proteins: chicken, legumes, low-fat cheeses, etc;</li>
	<li>You can give whole fat pasteurized milk to children aged 1-2 and skimmed milk to children older than 2 years;</li>
	<li>Provide a varied and balanced diet with minimally processed foods;</li>
	<li>Avoid giving your child high-calorie and salty foods (fatty pastries, snacks, chips,), which will saturate him and reduce his appetite for more nutritious foods; </li>
	<li>Avoid offering your child sweetened foods: sweets, cookies, chocolate, chocolate milk;</li>
	<li>Talk to your child to let them know that you are supportive; </li>
	<li>Focus on gradually changing the level of physical activities and eating habits of the whole family so that the child does not feel lonely; </li>
	<li>Be a positive example to your child;</li>
	<li>Establish routines in eating, activities and sleep, allow him enough time to sleep;</li>
	<li>Limit sitting time in front of the screen (tablet, TV, phone) to less than 1 hour;</li>
	<li>Engage your child, if older than 2 years, in moderate and intensive physical activities divided in shorter intervals, which the child and the whole family will enjoy and which are not too difficult for him (fast walking, swimming, jumping, ball games, cycling .. ) for at least 60 to 90 minutes during the day. </li>

3386,Optimal nutrition for children 13 to 24 months old,"In the second year of life, a child needs a variety of foods for healthy growth and development. The journey from breastfeeding to joining family meals takes time and your baby will not immediately accept all the types of food you prepare for him. Think about what and how much the child ate each week, rather than each day.","<p>Continue breastfeeding your child on demand both day and night. This will maintain his or her health and strength as breast milk continues to be the most important part of your baby’s diet. There is no need to give infant formula or follow-up formulas (which are specially formulated milks for older children from 6 months of age), as breastmilk with a diversified diet provides all the nutrients your child needs.</p>

<p>Breast milk continues to make up about one third (1/3) of the energy needs of the young child from 12 up to 24 months.</p>

<h3>When giving complementary foods to your baby, there are 6 important things to do:</h3>

<p><strong>Frequency:</strong> Feed your young child complementary foods 5 times a day</p>

<p><strong>Amount:</strong> Increase amount to three-quarters (¾) to 1 cup (250 ml cup). Use a separate plate to make sure young child eats all the food given</p>

<p><strong>Thickness:</strong> Give family foods cut into small pieces, finger foods, sliced food</p>

<p><strong>Variety:</strong> Try to feed a variety of foods at each meal.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>Animal-source foods: well-boiled minced meat from low-fat beef, lamb, horse meat, pork, chicken, turkey, liver, fish, eggs and dairy products. Animal source foods are very important. Start animal source foods as early and as often as possible. Cook well and chop fine.</li>
	<li>Beans, well-cooked and grated (skinning)</li>
	<li>Cooked vegetables puree: carrot, turnip, pumpkin, cauliflower, white, brussels sprouts, cucumber, beetroot, eggplant, tomato, zucchini, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot, cabbage, parsnip, you can also combine various vegetables with porridge</li>
	<li>Soft fruits puree: bananas, apples, pears, peaches, plums, though make sure your child is not just fed fruits, and that vegetables are fed</li>
	<li>Dairy products like cottage cheese, yogurt
	<ul>
		<li>Nuts in paste form</li>
		<li>Additional nutritious snacks (extra food between meals) such as pieces of ripe fruit, or other fruits and vegetables, when in season, can be offered once or twice per day.</li>
		<li>Use iodized salt</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Avoid</strong> giving highly processed foods, such as sugary drinks, sweet biscuits/cookies/cakes, fried foods or fast foods. These foods are high in fat, salt and/or sugar, and contain preservatives which can prevent healthy growth in your child.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong> is the healthiest (and cheapest) drink for a child! You offer water often, always after a meal, do not wait for a child to get thirsty.</p>

<h3><strong>Responsive feeding</strong></h3>

<p>Be patient and actively encourage your baby to eat. Don’t force your baby to eat.  Use a separate plate to feed the baby to make sure he or she eats all the food given. Give the child food ""out of hand"", encourage him to eat on his own. The child should have his own cutlery.</p>

<h3><strong>Hygiene</strong></h3>

<p>Good hygiene (cleanliness) is important to avoid diarrhea and other illnesses. Use a clean spoon or cup to give foods or liquids to your baby. Store the foods to be given to your baby in a safe hygienic place. Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing foods and feeding baby. Wash your hands and your baby’s hands before eating. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet and washing or cleaning baby’s bottom.</p>

	<li>Your child's growth is assessed by measuring growth parameters: body weight, body length (length is measured when the baby is lying down up to 2 years of age) and head circumference, and then comparing them with growth standards issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). For day-to-day use, these standards have been translated into growth charts which are created differently for boys and for girls.</li>
	<li>At each routine health check-up (the number of visits varies across countries), your child will be measured, and the obtained values will be entered into growth charts, thus monitoring if your child is growing well and whether s/he is on track.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At birth: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Average values of body weight and body length at birth, are slightly higher in boys (about 3600 g and 51.5 cm) compared to girls (about 3500 g and 50.5 cm), which clearly reflects the influence of genetic factors on growth. Average head circumference is about 35cm.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>First month: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not be surprised if your child loses up to 10% of her body weight in the first days after birth. This is expected, the loss is temporary and will be compensated with proper care and nutrition, preferably with breast milk, no later than by the end of the second week of life.</li>
	<li>In the coming days, the child is expected to start gaining weight, on average 20 to 30 g a day.</li>
	<li>The first month is the month when the is child getting used to the living conditions in the external environment and there are great variations in growth. That is why it may happen that your child gains only 400 grams, or if he is born big, often asks to be breastfed and sleeps well, he may gain 1000 grams and more. During this time, he grows 4.5 to 5 cm on average.</li>
	<li>The growth of the head is especially monitored because it is conditioned by the speed of brain growth. The brain is being filled with a lot of information from the environment and is growing at a fantastic speed, so during this month the head circumference can increase by about 2.5 cm.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>First three months: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Your baby will continue to grow at about the same speed as during the first few weeks of life. During these months, she is expected to gain 700 to 900 grams, to grow 2.5 to 4 cm and 1.2 cm in head circumference per month. The figures given are only average values and therefore mild deviations are possible for typical growth and your child`s progress will be assessed based on the overall picture.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6 months</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>From the fourth to the seventh month, the child will continue to gain about 450 to 550 g per month. During this time, he will grow about 6 cm and the head circumference will increase by about 2.5 cm.</li>
	<li>In the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 6<sup>th</sup> month, most children double their birth bodyweight. For premature babies, this can happen during 3-4 months of age.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Each child's growth is unique, and if the child has optimal nutrition and a nurturing environment, it generally follows the growth pattern established in the first months of life, while regular measurements and keeping growth charts help us to monitor it properly.</strong></p>",596,5,"43,44,45,46",59,60,,,0,1,<p><strong>WHO child growth standards and the identification of severe acute malnutrition in infants and children.

She continued to grow with the same intensity in this period as well.</p>

<ul>
	<li>During this period, breast milk (or infant formula) is not the only food that the child eats and she is gradually getting used to eating other foods of plant and animal origin. On the other hand, she is becoming more active in moving and exploring the environment, which will have a significant impact on growth. Let's just remind ourselves that a child grows while sleeping and that growth also depends on how much time she spends sleeping and what is her sleep like.</li>
	<li>It is important that the child continues to follow the growth pattern he established during the first weeks of life</li>
	<li>You may expect that in this period your child will grow 1,5 to 2 cm and gain 300 to 350 g. If the child is smaller and very lively, it will be enough for him to get 200 to 250 g in the ninth month.</li>

			<h2>About child growth</h2>

			<p>Children’s growth is a sign of their overall health and nutrition.</p>

			<p>All babies and children grow at different rates, and there’s a big range when it comes to ‘normal’. Your child’s growth is unique for him or her, and usually follows a pattern that’s right for him or her.</p>

			<p><strong>At home with your baby</strong>, you’ll know whether she’s growing. You’ll notice her getting too big for her clothes, bassinet, baby bath or other things that seemed enormous when she was just a newborn.</p>

			<h2>What are growth charts ?</h2>

			<p>Growth charts are used by health professional and parents to track your child’s growth and development in the early years. Your child’s growth is calculated based on the World Health Organization‘s growth standards. These standards represent the best description of physiological growth for all children from birth to five years of age and is based on data from 8500 children from around the world, including Europe. The Z-scores or standard deviation scores is the unit used for measuring the children’s growth.  These units tell us how far your child’s growth measurement is from the average.  </p>

			<p>Growth charts are graphs that <strong>show changes in your child’s length or height, weight and head circumference</strong> over time. Your health professional – for example, your child and family health nurse – measures these things regularly and marks the measurements on the graph. It is best to input these measurements into the cell phone application to also have the growth curves of your child’s handy and recorded with you.</p>

			<p>There are different growth charts for boys and girls, for younger children and older children.</p>

			<h2>Understanding child growth charts</h2>

			<p>Growth charts have lots of lines (curves) on them that show the range of typical child growth patterns at different ages. </p>

			<p>Most children’s lengths, weights and heads are somewhere between the top and bottom curves on the charts. Half of all children grow at a rate above the middle of the typical range, and half grow at a rate below this range. The limit values are arbitrarily determined and there are two standard deviations (SD) or Z scores above and below the average value for age.</p>

			<p>Sometimes children’s individual growth curves cross over curves on the chart. If this happens with your child, your health care professional will closely monitor your child’s growth over the next few appointments. Your child’s growth might get back on track on its own, or your health professional might suggest some things you can do to help.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If the value of the child's body weight in relation to age or body weight for body length / height is below -2 SD, it is considered that the child is moderately wasted or thin, and if it is below -3 SD, it is considered to be severely wasted or thin,.</li>
				<li>If the value of the child's body weight in relation to age or the value of body weight for body length / height, in the field between +2 and +3 SD it is considered that the child is overweight and if it is in the field above + 3SD that he is obese.</li>
				<li>If the value of the child's body length / height in relation to the age is below - 2 SD, it is considered that the child is stunted. Stunting is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually because of poor nutrition/feeding practices, micronutrient deficiencies,  frequent illness or repeated illness over a period of several years.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>How child growth is measured</h2>

			<p><strong>Length</strong> is measured when your baby is lying down. For children over two years, height is measured when they’re standing up.</p>

			<p>For children under two years, <strong>weight</strong> is measured without clothing on a special infant weighing scale. After two years, weight is measured in ‘light’ clothing on a regular set of scales.</p>

			<p><strong>Head circumference</strong> is usually measured by putting a tape measure around your baby’s head. Babies’ heads grow rapidly in the first year, which makes it easy to check that that they’re growing in a healthy way.</p>

3421,What affects child growth,"<p>A child grows under the influence of numerous factors. Some of them are hereditary, but living conditions and environmental factors have a strong impact and can significantly inform the end result.</p>","<h2> Hereditary <strong>factors</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The influence of <strong>hereditary factors</strong> on a child's growth is widely known.</li>
	<li>The difference in body weight between male and female children can be observed already at birth.</li>
	<li>The differences in height between healthy children of the same sex and age are great.</li>
	<li>It is also known that the height of a healthy child, from the third year of life onwards, shows a significant correlation with the average height of the parents, which is termed genetic growth potential.</li>
	<li>Hereditary disorders also have consequences for growth, e.g. in Down and Turner syndrome (chromosome-level disorder) or Prader-Willi syndrome (gene-level disorder), and reduce growth potential in children.       </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Environmental factors</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Nutrition</strong> has a key impact on every child's growth.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The child must have access to balanced amounts of nutrients necessary to meet his/her basic needs in terms of building blocks and energy.</li>
	<li>This includes the intake of proteins (especially essential amino acids), fats, carbohydrates, vitamins (especially A and D), trace elements such as iodine, iron, zinc, etc.</li>
	<li>Inadequate nutrition requires addressing deficiencies in food and feeding modality, to avoid growth disorders with far-reaching consequences due to the special sensitivity of this period.</li>
	<li>Stressful situations in a child's life, such as: poverty and family troubles, child abuse and neglect, etc., if they last for a longer time, can have a lasting negative impact on the child's growth and development.  </li>
	<li>Some drugs such as corticosteroids, if given in higher doses and over a longer period of time, can also slow down growth.</li>
	<li>Climate and hygienic conditions in the environment also have an impact. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Factors related to the child him/herself</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Growth rate is under the direct impact of hormones, especially growth hormone and thyroid hormones, and during puberty sex hormones as well.</li>
	<li>Throughout childhood and puberty, growth hormone plays a key role in maintaining normal growth rate.</li>
	<li>Other hormones: cortisol, insulin, parathormone, digestive hormones, tissue growth factors, etc., have a specific role in metabolic processes through which they exert their influence on growth. </li>
	<li>Acquired chronic diseases of the kidneys, intestines, lungs, heart, liver, immune system, etc., depending on the time when they occur, the severity and duration of the disease, may temporarily, which is less common, or permanently slow down the child's growth.</li>
	<li>The child grows at night, while sleeping; hence, growth depends on the child's activity and the amount of sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has been observed that the average human body height is still increasing; this is more pronounced in men than in women, which is considered to be a consequence of better living conditions.</p>

3426,Introducing non-milk foods into the child's diet,"<p>Around 6th month of life, your baby will need other foods in addition to your breastmilk for healthy growth and development. The period of introducing non-milk food is a period of rapid growth and development. It is important that the child gets food recommended for his/her age, of appropriate consistency and in appropriate quantity, in a way appropriate to the child's age and abilities.</p>","<p>Non-milk food is solid or semi-solid food that is given to an infant in addition to breastfeeding when breastmilk is no longer sufficient to meet the nutritional needs (or in addition to formula, for children who are breastfed with supplementation or artificially fed).</p>

<p>Introducing solid foods helps your baby learn to eat, giving him/her experiences of new food flavors and textures. It helps develop the teeth and jaws, as well as other skills that will be needed later for speech development.</p>

<p>This is a transitional period from milk feeding to eating at the family table, which the infant is mostly ready to do from the age of one.</p>

<p>The introduction of non-milk foods has not only a direct impact on growth and development during the first year of life; there is also growing scientific evidence of a long-term health impact for life. A healthy diet supports the child's growth, directs brain development, strengthens the potential for learning, improves productivity in adulthood.  </p>

<p>If a child does not adopt healthy eating habits on time and does not accept different types of food, he/she often later eats only a certain type of food, which can have health consequences (not enough vegetables, deficiency of vitamins, trace elements, antioxidants; empty calories, risk of obesity and chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes).</p>

<h2>When is non-milk food introduced into an infant's diet?</h2>

<p>A naturally-fed infant should start consuming non-milk foods at the age of about 6 months, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Exclusive breastfeeding until the age of 6 months is the best way to feed children. The introduction of non-milk foods before 17th week increases the risk of obesity, as well as allergies.</p>

<p>A breastfed infant with formula supplementation should get non-milk foods from 5th month of life (not before 17th and not after 24th week). From 5th month, the functions of the digestive and excretory organs are sufficiently mature, as are motor functions that enable  feeding the child with semi-solid and solid food.</p>

<h2>How will you know that your child is ready for the introduction of non-milk diet?</h2>

<p>Children grow and mature at different speeds. Signs that a child is ready for non-milk foods are usually clear at the age of about six months:</p>

<p>Keep track if your baby is starting to be able to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>stay seated upright without being held for support, lean forward and return to a stable upright position; the shoulder and neck muscles are strong enough to support the head</li>
	<li>control hand movements so that he/she can deliberately pick up a small object and put it in his/her mouth</li>
	<li>not expel food from the mouth with his/her tongue, but is able to swallow it</li>
	<li>control saliva swallowing</li>
</ul>

<p>Signs or signals that are NOT good indicators of readiness - as they can mean something else:</p>

<ul>
	<li>more frequent waking up at night or anxiety</li>
	<li>the baby can easily be distracted while breastfeeding</li>
	<li>tooth growth, drooling or chewing fists</li>
	<li>showing interest when others are eating, playing with food (food is not swallowed)</li>
	<li>accepting food if an adult puts it in his/her mouth</li>
</ul>

<p>You may misinterpret this behavior as the child's readiness for the introduction of solid foods. Sometimes parents simply want a new activity with their child and are eager to reach a new stage in their baby's development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a child is learning to eat, he/she needs not only food, but also smiles and patience. Think of feeding as a time you spend interacting with your baby instead of focusing on the amount of food eaten.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Include your baby in family meals so that he/she is offered food eaten by the family and can see others using their eating skills.</p>

3431,Meal preparation for a child - healthy and safe food,"<p>""The choice of food, the way food is prepared and stored affect its nutritional properties. When it comes to baby food, it is especially important to take care of safe preparation and storage. Ideally, infant and young child food should be prepared immediately before feeding and not stored at all after cooking. ""</p>","<h2>Basic tips for meal preparation:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Cook for your child.</li>
	<li>Use ready-made purées only in exceptional situations (travel, emergency obligations).</li>
	<li>Ready-made baby food may contain excess fat, sugar or preservatives; taste or consistency may differ from natural, local foods; it is important for your baby to get used to the natural tastes of food.</li>
	<li>Do not add salt and sugar to infant food; if you prepare food for the whole family, separate the child's portion before adding salt, spices or powder.</li>
	<li>Make sure the food you buy is properly packaged and check the expiration date. Do not use food after the expiration date.</li>
	<li>Choose fresh foods, store and prepare them so as to preserve as many nutritional properties as possible.</li>
	<li>Storing fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator for a long time, long cooking, cooking in large amounts of fluids are not conducive to the preservation of vitamins.</li>
	<li>Fruits and vegetables should be washed thoroughly under running water, especially those that grow low on the ground. Peel the fruit (although the peel contains the most vitamins, pectin and other healthy ingredients, it also contains the most pesticides and other chemicals that industrially grown fruit is inevitably treated with).</li>
	<li>If at all possible, always prepare purée from fresh vegetables. You will not go wrong if you use frozen vegetables.</li>
	<li>A child should have his/her own cutlery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips for safe food preparation and storage</h2>

<h3>Cleanliness</h3>

<p>Wash your hands before touching food and frequently during food preparation. Before feeding, wash both your own and your child's hands. Prepare food on a clean surface, using clean utensils. Protect your kitchen and food from insects, pests and other animals.</p>

<h3>Separate raw and cooked food</h3>

<p>Do not mix raw foods, especially meat, with already prepared foods or foods that will not be cooked. Use dedicated equipment and utensils such as knives and cutting boards for raw food. Store food in closed containers to avoid contact between raw and prepared food.</p>

<h3>Cook food long enough                                                                                                                                 </h3>

<p>Cook food long enough, especially meat, poultry, eggs and seafood. Cook food such as soups and stews until they boil. For meat and poultry, make sure the juices from them are transparent, not red. Reheat cooked food long enough. Bring to a boil or heat until too hot to touch. Stir while heating.</p>

<h3>Take care of the bacteriological safety of food</h3>

<p>Do not give young children soft boiled eggs or food that contains raw eggs (creams, ice cream, mayonnaise), because of the risk of infection, especially salmonella. Do not give unpasteurized milk or dairy products from this milk; store dairy products in the refrigerator and take care of the expiration date.</p>

<h3>Store food at safe temperatures</h3>

<p>It is not recommended to store cooked food at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Prepared food can be stored in the refrigerator, in closed containers, for a maximum of 24 hours. You can freeze freshly prepared purée in smaller bowls, but not for longer than three weeks. Do not thaw frozen food at room temperature.</p>

<h3>Always think about the child's safety</h3>

<p>Some foods pose a risk to the child due to the possibility of choking or suffocation, so they should not be given to children under 4 years: peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, seeds, popcorn, hard candy, whole grapes, larger hard pieces of meat, raw fruits or vegetables .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not allow the child to eat while running, jumping or lying down. Teach your toddler not to talk with food in his/her mouth.</p>

<h1><strong>Child development in the 1st month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>During the first month of life, the baby has a big and important task of <strong>getting acquainted with the new environment</strong> in which she found herself after birth. The main way your baby communicates with you during this period is through crying. <strong>By crying, the baby sends</strong> <strong>different messages -</strong> that she is hungry, wet, tired or simply that she needs a comforting touch.  She begins to <strong>recognize sounds</strong>—especially the voices of those who care for her.  She especially likes to hear high-pitched voices, which is why both mothers and fathers naturally use a kind of “baby talk” with little ones.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>It is really important that you always respond to your baby's calls during this early period. Sometimes you might not know why your baby is crying, but even then, it is important to comfort her with your presence, voice, cuddling, stroking and gentle rocking. All this helps her feel safe. By listening to the different ways in which your baby cries, you will gradually learn what she is trying to tell you. Remember - you cannot spoil a baby by holding her in your arms, feeding her, cuddling her or talking and singing to her in a gentle voice. </p>

<p>               Listen to her cry and try to understand the reason for crying. The baby may cry because she just wants your touch or because she is hungry, has some discomfort (uncomfortable body position or a wet diaper), she is sleepy, has cramps or because something else hurts. Always comfort your baby by addressing her in a warm, soothing voice, taking her in your arms, rocking and cuddling her. Do not be afraid, you will not spoil her. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your baby would rather <strong>look at your face</strong>, and other human faces, than anything else.  You are the center of her life.  She wants and needs to be close to you.  This is her <strong>first relationship</strong> and it is a powerful one.  She <strong>loves to be touched</strong>, but not in a way that is too quick or rough.</p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Because your baby is not yet able to see a lot of things at a distance, get up close to her when you can—“Here I am!  Look!” Keep physical contact with the baby as often as possible - hold her in your arms, cuddle her. Enjoy skin-to-skin contact. Talk to her, make eye contact and smile as you feed, dress or bathe her.  Help her become calm by handling her gently and soothingly, and by speaking softly to her. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Until now, your baby has been developing within the safe space of her mother's womb.  Birth is a big change for her.  Now she will <strong>learn by seeing, hearing and touching</strong>. During this period, human faces are the most interesting thing for your baby. By the end of the first month, your baby will probably be able to <strong>follow your face with her eyes</strong> if it is close enough (at about 20 to 30 cm). Things that have striking, <strong>contrasting colours</strong> - black and white or red and white, will also be very interesting for her. She may hear and recognize your voice, but sometimes she might be startled by a sudden sound and react with her whole body.  At the end of this month, your baby will be <strong>much more alert and responsive</strong> than at the time of her birth—great changes in just a few weeks!</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>The time she spends with you every day is key to her overall development and the development of her brain.  The way you respond to your baby’s needs will shape her image of the world and the people in it.  It is so simple and so important.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Even though your baby’s nervous system is still maturing, she is developing rapidly during the first month of life.  By the end of the first month, your baby may <strong>try to lift her head briefly</strong> when she is lying on her tummy or <strong>turn it to the side</strong> when she is lying on her back. This helps her to see where you are and observe the exciting world around her. Sometimes she will <strong>hold your finger</strong> firmly with her hand, but most of the time she will keep her hands in a tight fist.   She may quiver or jerk<strong> her arms</strong> and legs in movements that will become more coordinated later, and she sometimes brings her hands near her eyes and mouth. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Besides holding your baby, place her on her back to sleep for safety, and give her some very brief “tummy times” on your lap when she is not sleeping or being held.  Give her the freedom to use her arms and legs, but also try wrapping her cosily (swaddling) when she is distressed. </p>

<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Parents’ concerns about development in the 1st month </strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had earlier, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your baby is crying a lot, and you are not able to comfort her  </li>
	<li>She sucks poorly and feeds very slowly  </li>
	<li>She sleeps more than expected (more than 16 hours a day), or she does not sleep peacefully  </li>
	<li>She is not moving her arms or legs at all  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>She does not startle when a loud noise is made </li>
	<li>She does not blink at bright lights.</li>

<h1><strong>Child development during the 2nd month   </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>The first thing you may notice during this period is that your <strong>baby</strong><strong> </strong><strong>cries more </strong>than she used to in the first days after birth. This is expected during the second month of development, and it will continue during the third month.  It actually means that your baby is learning to communicate with you. Her <strong>cries are more distinct</strong> now—different cries to indicate her hunger, discomfort, or tiredness.   You will also begin to notice that she is making <strong>cooing sounds</strong> (may be “ooh” or “aah”) and gurgles. </p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p> It will take her a while to make sure you understand the way she communicates, so it is important to respond to your baby’s cry every time.  Speak to your baby clearly and slowly when your baby makes a sound, express joy with your facial expressions and voice and repeat her sounds. </p>

<p>              </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your baby has <strong>developed a relationship</strong> with you and recognizes you - mostly by your smell and voice.  She tries to look for you and other special people.  During this period, she may already respond to you with her first <strong>smile</strong>—a magical moment.  </p>

<p>She will generally become more sensitive to sounds during the second month - not only will she recognise you when you speak to her, but she will also <strong>respond to your voice</strong> by looking for your face when you talk to her.  She still needs your comfort, of course, but she is becoming able to <strong>comfort herself</strong>, for example by putting her fist in her mouth. </p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p>Whenever you respond by satisfying your baby's need - feeding her, changing her wet clothes, or  reaching out to her with your voice and touch - she will feel comforted and safe.  Always soothe your baby by speaking in a soft voice, gentle touching, rocking or singing. Your baby likes to be near you. She likes to look around and listen.  Rock her, sing and talk to her,  use baby talk, and play with her often. Pay attention to what pleases her and what soothes her.  Help her learn to calm herself—it is fine for her to suck on her fingers. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>She is <strong>learning a lot through her eyes</strong> – for example, she follows interesting objects with her eyes.  She is <strong>curious about faces</strong> she sees, which are another source of new information for your baby.   She may start being<strong> bored</strong> and fussy if an activity does not change, or <strong>overstimulated</strong> if there is too much change.</p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p>When your baby is on her tummy, you can put a toy with bright colours in front of her and move it from one side to the other. If your baby starts complaining, turning her head to the side or crying during playing, it can be a sign of excessive stimulation. You may need to slow down the play a little or take a break.  However, you can also observe whether perhaps she is a bit bored and will enjoy a new activity or just being carried to a different part of the room.  You know your baby best!  You can offer your baby different things that she can look at, touch and hold in her hand. When she is lying on her back, hold a toy or rattle above her head, at eye level, and encourage her to reach for it.  This is a new and interesting problem for her to solve.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>By the end of the second month,  your baby’s motor skills become better and better.   Children develop on different timelines, but during this period, she will probably be able to<strong> </strong><strong>lift</strong><strong> </strong><strong>her</strong><strong> </strong><strong>head and move</strong> it from side to side when she is on her tummy.  Her <strong>arm and leg movements are smoother</strong> and more coordinated than when she was a newborn.  It is interesting for her to discover her body, so <strong>her</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hands and fingers</strong> will probably be the most amusing for her in this period. For example, she will explore her hands by looking at them, putting them together and separating them, and with your help, she will be able to <strong>hold an object</strong> in her hands.</p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p> Put your baby on her tummy when she is awake, with interesting, safe objects near her.  Stroke and massage your baby - you will encourage her motor development.  At the same time, you will bond with her and be able to comfort her if she is distressed.  </p>

<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development during the 2nd month </strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the baby frequently cries a lot, and you are not usually able to soothe her   </li>
	<li>she isn’t watching faces even for a short time   </li>
	<li>she isn’t responding to bright light or loud sounds   </li>
	<li>she isn’t feeding or sleeping well (or sleeps more than 16 hours a day)</li>
	<li>she isn’t moving her arms or legs at all</li>
	<li>she isn`t bringing her hands to her mouth   </li>
	<li>she isn’t smiling at people.  </li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Child development during the 2nd month  </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>The first thing you may notice during this period is that your <strong>baby</strong><strong> </strong><strong>cries more </strong>than he used to in the first days after birth. This is expected during the second month of development, and it will continue during the third month.  It actually means that your baby is learning to communicate with you. His <strong>cries are more distinct</strong> now—different cries to indicate his hunger, discomfort, or tiredness.   You will also begin to notice that he is making <strong>cooing sounds</strong> (may be “ooh” or “aah”) and gurgles. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p> It will take him a while to make sure you understand the way he communicates, so it is important to respond to your baby’s cry every time.  Speak to your baby clearly and slowly when your baby makes a sound, express joy with your facial expressions and voice and repeat his sounds. </p>

<p>            </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your baby has <strong>developed a relationship</strong> with you and recognizes you - mostly by your smell and voice.  He tries to look for you and other special people.  During this period, he may already respond to you with his first <strong>smile</strong>—a magical moment.  </p>

<p>He will generally become more sensitive to sounds during the second month - not only will he recognise you when you speak to him, but he will also <strong>respond to your voice</strong> by looking for your face when you talk to him.  He still needs your comfort, of course, but he is becoming able to <strong>comfort himself</strong>, for example by putting his fist in his mouth. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Whenever you respond by satisfying your baby's need - feeding him, changing his wet clothes, or  reaching out to him with your voice and touch - he will feel comforted and safe.  Always soothe your baby by speaking in a soft voice, gentle touching, rocking or singing. Your baby likes to be near you. He likes to look around and listen.  Rock him, sing and talk to him,  use baby talk, and play with him often. Pay attention to what pleases him and what soothes him.  Help him learn to calm himself—it is fine for him to suck on his fingers. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>He is <strong>learning a lot through his eyes</strong> – for example, he follows interesting objects with his eyes.  He is <strong>curious about faces</strong> he sees, which are another source of new information for your baby.   He may start being<strong> bored</strong> and fussy if an activity does not change, or <strong>overstimulated</strong> if there is too much change.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>When your baby is on his tummy, you can put a toy with bright colours in front of him and move it from one side to the other. If your baby starts complaining, turning his head to the side or crying during playing, it can be a sign of excessive stimulation. You may need to slow down the play a little or take a break.  However, you can also observe whether perhaps he is a bit bored and will enjoy a new activity or just being carried to a different part of the room.  You know your baby best!  You can offer your baby different things that he can look at, touch and hold in his hand. When he is lying on his back, hold a toy or rattle above his head, at eye level, and encourage him to reach for it.  This is a new and interesting problem for him to solve.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>By the end of the second month,  your baby’s motor skills become better and better.   Children develop on different timelines, but during this period, he will probably be able to<strong> </strong><strong>lift</strong><strong> </strong><strong>his</strong><strong> </strong><strong>head and move</strong> it from side to side when he is on his tummy.  His <strong>arm and leg movements are smoother</strong> and more coordinated than when he was a newborn.  It is interesting for him to discover his body, so <strong>his</strong><strong> </strong><strong>hands and fingers</strong> will probably be the most amusing for him in this period. For example, he will explore his hands by looking at them, putting them together and separating them, and with your help, he will be able to <strong>hold an object</strong> in his hands.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p> Put your baby on his tummy when he is awake, with interesting, safe objects near him.  Stroke and massage your baby - you will encourage his motor development.  At the same time,  you will bond with him and be able to comfort him if he is distressed.  </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development during the 2nd month </strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the baby frequently cries a lot, and you are not usually able to soothe him   </li>
	<li>he isn’t watching faces even for a short time   </li>
	<li>he isn’t responding to bright light or loud sounds    </li>
	<li>he isn’t feeding or sleeping well (or sleeps more than 16 hours a day)   </li>
	<li>he isn’t moving his arms or legs at all</li>
	<li>he isn`t bringing his hands to his mouth   </li>
	<li>he isn’t smiling at people.  </li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 3rd to the 4th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>In the first two months you got to know each other and established routines together.  Now you will see your baby master <strong>new ways of communicating</strong> and learn more intensively about feelings. Although crying is still her most important signal, the period of intense crying will slowly come to an end, because your baby will now try to communicate with you in different ways. For example, you will see her <strong>smile,</strong> or even give a loud <strong>laugh</strong>, when she sees or experiences something that she likes.  She will often try to respond to you by <strong>cooing</strong> or making a vowel sound like “aaaah”!  She loves making sounds, so you may also hear her babble when you leave her alone.  Sometimes she even copies sounds that she hears.  She is really communicating now!</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>               When you hold and talk happily to her, she will listen carefully, and sometimes try to repeat your voice sounds.   So do this often.  Talk to your baby, and be sure to listen to her response.  When she makes sounds, show her that you are happy and excited to hear them.  She will also enjoy hearing you copy some of her babbling sounds.  Make time in your day for quiet play times when you sing to your baby, tell her a story, or show a book to her.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your baby continues to be <strong>fascinated by faces</strong>.  She can observe them carefully and for a long time.  She is so interested in you—she <strong>may copy your smile</strong> and even a frown. Around this period, she will also begin to connect what you are saying with your facial expression. Now she can also recognize the voices of people who look after her and <strong>turns her head when she hears them</strong>.   At this age, you will see her spontaneously smile at special people.   You will also notice that your baby <strong>loves to play with people</strong>.  You could say that right now people are her favourite toys!</p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>While talking or listening to her, always look her in the eye.  Give her lots of chances to watch your facial expressions. Smile at her and show that you enjoy imitating her. Hold her in your arms, caress her, smile at her, use baby talk with her, talk and sing to her, and shower her with attention every day. Pay attention to what pleases your baby and fulfil her needs.  By doing so, you will make her happy. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>She will want to <strong>explore the world with her own hands</strong>. Sometime during this period, she will start <strong>reaching for objects</strong> in her surroundings, and she will try to put things she can grab in her mouth. As your baby is using her hands and fingers more, you may find her staring at her hands in admiration and often using them as her first very fun toys.  During this period, she is also <strong>learning by looking</strong>.  Her eyes follow moving objects.  Of course she loves faces but she is also learning by watching them.  She begins to recognize people, and also familiar objects, not just when they are up close, but now when they are further away.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Allow her to explore by giving her the possibility to grasp safe objects of different shapes, textures and colours.  Let her enjoy them with both the sense of touch and the sense of taste.  Put interesting objects in her hands and help her to hold them.  Play games like peek-a-boo. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>During the third and fourth month, you will notice that your baby can better <strong>control the movements of her head.</strong> She does not need as much support for her head when you hold her in your arms or put her down. Your baby is <strong>exploring possible ways of moving</strong>. When you put her on her tummy, she may be able to raise her head and support herself with her arms.  She <strong>may also be able to roll over</strong> from her tummy to her back.  She can now not just hold a toy or other object, but she can also <strong>shake an object and swing at an object</strong> that is dangled in front of her.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Give your baby many opportunities to use her body in different ways.  Get down on the floor with her for some play times.  Find simple everyday objects that she can hold and explore.   Your baby needs to explore with her mouth, but only with safe objects.  Be especially careful about small things that could cause choking. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>In these months, you will see that your baby <strong>is communicating with you more intensively</strong>.  You will hear her <strong>coo, babble and make sounds</strong> - most often vowel sounds like “aaaa” and “eeee”....   But now she will probably be able to make sounds that resemble words (ba-ba, ga-ga).  Very often this will be in response to something you say to her.  Your baby might also try to <strong>imitate</strong> the sounds you produce as well as the expressions she sees on your face.  Finally, during this time she will probably learn to recognize and respond to some words, such as her name or the word ""no.""</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>There is so much that you can do in your everyday routines.  Encourage communication with your baby by looking into her eyes as you talk to her or as you listen to her “talk” to you. Encourage her with a smile or by repeating the sounds she made, so that you help the conversation between you last as long as possible. </p>

<p>Talk to your child every day.  Encourage communication in many ways--sing to her,  look with her at pictures in magazines, point to things in shop windows and describe them, read aloud simple books or tell her stories and make interesting sounds (the cat says “miaow,” the cow says “moooo”!). When your baby looks at something, talk about what she sees.  Say things to your child as you prepare for breastfeeding or as you prepare a meal (“Now I’m getting your fruit”); that’s one way that she will learn to wait a little and be patient.  Words help in many ways!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>In this period, most babies begin to <strong>recognize familiar persons</strong>, such as parents, other close family members, and familiar child care providers, and enjoy interacting with them.  Your baby is learning to rely on these special people for comfort and help. She knows who is familiar and who is a stranger-- <strong>she may even show fear of new people</strong>.  Your baby will be able to <strong>use sounds to clearly express feelings</strong>.  She shows her joy and happiness by squealing or making other delighted sounds.  And she is able to use sounds to show intense dissatisfaction, anger or indignation. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Your baby needs your emotional support.  Therefore, it is important that you are there for her, especially when there are strangers around. Stay close to her, hold her in your arms, smile at her and talk to her in a soothing voice as you introduce her to new people. That way, she will feel safe and secure to make new contacts.  Interpret your child's moods. When she is happy, continue with the activity. If she is upset, take a break and comfort her.</p>

<p><strong><em>               </em></strong></p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Her intensive exploration is helping her develop her thinking skills.  She is <strong>looking curiously at objects</strong> and scenes in her environment.  If something is out of her reach, she tries to <strong>reach</strong> for it so that she can explore even more.  She is probably starting to <strong>move things from one hand into another</strong>, and to explore objects with her <strong>mouth</strong>. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Your baby will find many ways to explore on her own, but you can also show her different, interesting ways to use toys or other objects:  moving them from hand to hand, shaking, banging, pushing, and throwing.  Be aware of safety, especially when your baby is exploring with her mouth.  You might also try active games in front of a mirror for some new perspectives! </p>

<p>When your baby drops an object, pick it up and return it to her.  This helps her learn about cause and effect (“if I do this, that happens), and about how to think about the space around her.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>In this period, your baby is probably able to <strong>lift and hold her head</strong> on her own.  She will probably manage to be in a <strong>sitting position</strong> for some time while you support her and maybe even on her own.  She will <strong>roll from one side to the other</strong>.  All of this gives your baby a whole new perspective on the world--now she can see things that she could not see while lying on her back.  Because she can now change her position, she becomes interested and <strong>curious about more and more things</strong> around her.  She <strong>looks carefully at objects</strong> that surround her, following them closely with her eyes if they move. During this period, she will also develop the skill of <strong>reaching for objects</strong>, and once she grasps them, she will enjoy exploring them by putting them in her mouth or passing them from one hand to the other hand.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Play on the floor with your baby every day.  Every day, during your regular routines, give your baby a lot of opportunities to explore the environment and interesting objects around her.  Let her see the environment in different ways by putting her in different positions.   You can place your child's favourite object a little out of reach, and you can encourage her to get to it. Think about what safe, simple objects she can explore.  What can she pick up, touch, and turn over?  All of this is developing her movement skills and opening new opportunities to explore the world.   <strong>             </strong></p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 5th to the 6th month </strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your baby regularly cries for a long time and cannot be comforted  </li>
	<li>isn’t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with her eyes  </li>
</ul>

<ul>

3501,Talking about tough topics,"Key points

Tough topics for children include divorce, illness, death, sex and natural disasters.
Talking about tough topics reassures your child, helps your child understand things, and lets you explain family values.
The way you talk about tough topics depends on your child’s age and ability to understand, as well as your own cultural and family values.","<h2>Why it’s good to talk about tough topics with children</h2>

<p>Tough topics are those that can be emotional and difficult to discuss in your family.  Divorce, illness, death, sex, violence, natural disasters – these and other topics are all part of life. Talking about tough topics is one way you can help your child deal with life’s difficulties.</p>

<p>If you encourage open communication about tough topics, your child learns that she can always talk to you. <strong>She’ll understand that you’ll always be there to listen</strong> if something is worrying her.</p>

<p>And talking about tough topics with your child gives you a chance to explain values and beliefs that are important to your family and your culture.</p>

<p>Talking about tough topics can be important for children’s well-being. When children have the chance to express and work through feelings, it can help them to cope with stress.  If your child doesn’t understand the facts in a way that he can make sense of, he might imagine things that are far worse than the truth.</p>

<h2>Talking about tough topics with toddlers and preschoolers</h2>

<p>The way you handle tough topics will depend on your child’s age and how he makes sense of the world. </p>

<p>When you talk about tough topics with toddlers and preschoolers, it’s important to <strong>focus on feelings that they understand and explain things in simple language</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘Grandma has died and we won’t see her anymore. I’m very sad.’</li>
	<li>‘We love you. But we think the family will be happier if Dad and I live in different houses.’</li>
	<li>‘Babies grow in a place inside their mummies called the uterus’.</li>
	<li>‘I was really scared too when that car crashed into us, but we’re safe now.’</li>
	<li>'We wear masks to help keep us safe from the coronavirus. It helps the germs stay away from people.'</li>
</ul>

<p>Look for resources for how to talk about different tough topics at your library, through your child's school, or from your health provider. </p>

<p>Also, it’s good to be aware of what your child is seeing or talking about at child care or preschool, as well as what she might be seeing in the media. For example, are there news videos of protests or conflict in your community?  This can give you the chance to raise tough topics with your child before she asks.</p>

<h2>Planning for tough conversations</h2>

<p>It’s a good idea to think about tough topics before your child asks. This way you’ll be prepared when a tough topic comes up.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to help you plan for difficult conversations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tell your child sad or scary news yourself if you can, or ask someone who knows your child well to talk to your child. Tell your child as soon as you can after the event.</li>
	<li>If there’s time to plan ahead, choose a time when you’re both relaxed. If you can, choose a private and comfortable place to talk.</li>
	<li>Be honest. For example, ‘Yes, Dad is going to live with Sally now. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t love you any more’.</li>
	<li>Let your child know that he can ask you questions.</li>
	<li>Really listen to your child after you’ve started the conversation. Make eye contact and get down to your child’s level. You might find it useful to say her feelings back to her to check that you understand what she’s saying.</li>
	<li>Be ready to comfort your child with lots of cuddles if you need to.</li>
	<li>Use pretend play, drawing, and storybooks to help your preschooler process difficult information. </li>
	<li>Come back to the tough topic in a week if your child doesn’t raise it with you. Your child needs time to process what you’ve been talking about, but she might also need encouragement to talk about it again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topics you have trouble with</h2>

<p>There might be things you find really difficult to talk about. This could be because of your own background or your cultural and religious values. Or it could be because the tough topic affects you also, like divorce. If this sounds like you, you could consider talking to your partner or a friend about the issues that are difficult for you.</p>

<p>It’s OK to have feelings and to let your child know what they are. But if you show a great deal of distress, it might be upsetting for your child.  If you get too distressed when talking or thinking about tough topics, <strong>talk to your family health provider or another trusted professional</strong>. For example, if you’ve been through a traumatic event, you might find that talking about similar topics upsets you. </p>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>From the 7th to the 9th month, your baby will babble most of the time.  Her babbling can sound like real talking, using the rhythms of speech even though you cannot understand the words.  In this period, some babies will already say their first word, probably sounding like “ma-ma” or “da-da”, even though the baby will still not know its exact meaning.  At this age your baby will show that she understands some other words – for example, when you say,  “Where is mama?” or “Where is your papa?” she may look around for her mother or her father.  Or she might stop what she is doing when she hears the word “no.”    </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Talk with your baby as you go about your ordinary daily routines.  She loves to hear you talk with her.  It is easy:  just tell her what you are doing, what you’re going to do, or name the objects that you’re using or that are around her.  This helps your baby connect things with their names and meanings. When your baby babbles, respond warmly.  For example, if she babbles “ah-ah-ah” as she looks at fruit in the kitchen, you might copy her sounds and also say “Oh, do you see the apples?  See, here’s an apple!”    Besides talking with her, also sing, play songs, tell stories and read to her, every day.  This shows her how much you love her and helps her learn how to communicate.</p>

<p>              </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>At this age, even without words your baby will be able to let you know, very clearly, when she is happy or upset. These months are a time when your baby is developing a strong bond or attachment to you or close family members or caregivers.  But at the same time, she’s developing a fear of new people.  If a friendly neighbour comes to visit, your baby might hide or cry—even if she went happily to the person a few months before.  She is probably quite definite about who her favourite people are and will look for their attention and help.  She will use her new physical skills to move close to you or another special person, smile, and expect you to respond.  If you leave the room even briefly, she may get upset.   If she is upset about that or other things, she will look for a comforting cuddle. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Remember, these are normal, typical behaviours at this age—and they show that she knows who are the important people in her world and how much she cares about you.   Even though it is hard sometimes, be patient and provide your baby with a sense of security when she meets new people.  Pay attention to how your baby reacts to new situations and people, as her reactions will probably change from week to week.  If new people become part of her world, try to help her get used to them gradually, so that she  feels comfortable.  Name the feelings you notice in your child—“Yes, I see that you are feeling scared.  It will be all right; I’m here.  Let’s see if we can help you feel better.” </p>

<p>If you need to spend time away from your baby on a regular basis, for example, if she attends a child care program, make sure that your baby has some of her favourite things with her and is familiar with the care provider.  If possible, choose a setting in which she will be with the same care provider every day. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Because your baby is beginning to crawl and perhaps even stand with help, a whole new part of the world opens up to her. When she reaches interesting objects, she is now able to pick them up with a precise grip and   inspect them very carefully.  If you hide an object with a cloth, she looks for where she saw it last.  She can look for a toy that you cover with a piece of cloth.  If she throws something, she watches it and looks for the place where it fell.  </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Play games like peek-a-boo or a “hiding and finding” game—perhaps you put a small toy under a blanket and encourage your baby to pull the blanket to discover the toy.  She will love to repeat these kinds of games, that build thinking skills as well as emotional security.  She will also love to drop small objects into a bowl, take them out again, and do this ever and over.  (Do watch closely, as babies at this age also explore by putting objects in their mouth.)   Let her play with small objects, pushing them around, or rolling balls back and forth.  As she plays, she begins to understand that her actions can make certain things happen (cause/effect)—an important discovery. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  In this period, your baby develops many new motor skills that allow her to discover the charms of the world around her.  Each child develops on an individual timetable, but most likely she is now beginning not only to sit independently but also to move, most often by crawling or rolling.  She is also more and more successful in holding small objects with her fingers.  She skilfully examines objects with her hands, often passing items from one hand to another-- although she will still very often explore objects by putting them in her mouth.  In these areas and in others, your baby’s independence is growing.   In this period and depending on your traditions, you may be introducing your baby to solid foods.  </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Place your baby next to interesting objects that she can pick up safely. Allow your child to move around the room freely as long as the environment is safe and you are nearby to supervise and help if needed.  Make sure that none of the objects your baby handles are too small, to prevent the risk of choking.  Your task is to provide the baby with an environment that is stimulating enough so that she can explore, but also safe enough so that she does not get hurt.  When she discovers something, share her discovery with a big smile or comment (“Look what you found—a cup!  May I see it?”).  In this way, the baby will learn to develop her curiosity and feel safe and protected at the same time. </p>

<p>If she is beginning to eat solid food, allow her to explore different tastes and explore new foods in different ways.  Most children at this age will try to eat on their own (by picking up pieces of food and feeding themselves). </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month</strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>

<h1>  <strong>Child development in the period from the 7th to the 9th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>From the 7th to the 9th month, your baby will babble most of the time.  His babbling can sound like real talking, using the rhythms of speech even though you cannot understand the words.  In this period, some babies will already say their first word, probably sounding like “ma-ma” or “da-da”, even though the baby will still not know its exact meaning.  At this age your baby will show that he understands some other words – for example, when you say,  “Where is mama?” or “Where is your papa?” he may look around for his mother or his father.  Or he might stop what he is doing when he hears the word “no.”    </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Talk with your baby as you go about your ordinary daily routines.  He loves to hear you talk with him.  It is easy:  just tell him what you are doing, what you’re going to do, or name the objects that you’re using or that are around him.  This helps your baby connect things with their names and meanings. When your baby babbles, respond warmly.  For example, if he babbles “ah-ah-ah” as he looks at fruit in the kitchen, you might copy his sounds and also say “Oh, do you see the apples?  See, here’s an apple!”    Besides talking with him, also sing, play songs, tell stories and read to him, every day.  This shows him how much you love him and helps him learn how to communicate.</p>

<p>              </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>At this age, even without words your baby will be able to let you know, very clearly, when he is happy or upset. These months are a time when your baby is developing a strong bond or attachment to you or close family members or caregivers.  But at the same time, he’s developing a fear of new people.  If a friendly neighbour comes to visit, your baby might hide or cry—even if he went happily to the person a few months before.  He is probably quite definite about who his favourite people are and will look for their attention and help.  He will use his new physical skills to move close to you or another special person, smile, and expect you to respond.  If you leave the room even briefly, he may get upset.   If he is upset about that or other things, he will look for a comforting cuddle. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Remember, these are normal, typical behaviours at this age—and they show that he knows who are the important people in his world and how much he cares about you.   Even though it is hard sometimes, be patient and provide your baby with a sense of security when he meets new people.  Pay attention to how your baby reacts to new situations and people, as his reactions will probably change from week to week.  If new people become part of his world, try to help him get used to them gradually, so that he feels comfortable.  Name the feelings you notice in your child—“Yes, I see that you are feeling scared.  It will be all right; I’m here.  Let’s see if we can help you feel better.” </p>

<p>If you need to spend time away from your baby on a regular basis, for example, if he attends a child care program, make sure that your baby has some of his favourite things with him and is familiar with the care provider.  If possible, choose a setting in which he will be with the same care provider every day. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Because your baby is beginning to crawl and perhaps even stand with help, a whole new part of the world opens up to him. When he reaches interesting objects, he is now able to pick them up with a precise grip and   inspect them very carefully.  If you hide an object with a cloth, he looks for where he saw it last.  He can look for a toy that you cover with a piece of cloth.  If he throws something, he watches it and looks for the place where it fell.  </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Play games like peek-a-boo or a “hiding and finding” game—perhaps you put a small toy under a blanket and encourage your baby to pull the blanket to discover the toy.  He will love to repeat these kinds of games, that build thinking skills as well as emotional security.  He will also love to drop small objects into a bowl, take them out again, and do this ever and over.  (Do watch closely, as babies at this age also explore by putting objects in their mouth.)   Let him play with small objects, pushing them around, or rolling balls back and forth.  As he plays, he begins to understand that his actions can make certain things happen (cause/effect)—an important discovery. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  In this period, your baby develops many new motor skills that allow him to discover the charms of the world around him.  Each child develops on an individual timetable, but most likely he is now beginning not only to sit independently but also to move, most often by crawling or rolling.  He is also more and more successful in holding small objects with his fingers.  He skilfully examines objects with his hands, often passing items from one hand to another-- although he will still very often explore objects by putting them in his mouth.  In these areas and in others, your baby’s independence is growing.   In this period and depending on your traditions, you may be introducing your baby to solid foods.  </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Place your baby next to interesting objects that he can pick up safely. Allow your child to move around the room freely as long as the environment is safe and you are nearby to supervise and help if needed.  Make sure that none of the objects your baby handles are too small, to prevent the risk of choking.  Your task is to provide the baby with an environment that is stimulating enough so that he can explore, but also safe enough so that he does not get hurt.  When he discovers something, share his discovery with a big smile or comment (“Look what you found—a cup!  May I see it?”).  In this way, the baby will learn to develop his curiosity and feel safe and protected at the same time. </p>

<p>If he is beginning to eat solid food, allow him to explore different tastes and explore new foods in different ways.  Most children at this age will try to eat on their own (by picking up pieces of food and feeding themselves). </p>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 10th to the 12th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>This is the period when your baby`s <strong>first real word</strong> will most likely appear. Although she will still mostly babble, by the end of the first year your baby will probably use and understand at least one word (such as “ma-ma” or “da-da”). She will <strong>try to communicate</strong> intensively with you in every way she can - not only using words, but also by pointing, moving, nodding, waving... If your baby doesn`t use words yet, do not worry. She will find other way to attract your attention and let you know what she wants. She will understand you more and more.</p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p>Talk to your baby during daily rituals - dressing, feeding, walking, shopping… Just name what you do or what you see around you—it’s not a lesson, just a conversation!  If she tries to talk, give her sounds meaning by adding a bit (for example, when she says ""da-da"" or “ma-ma” you could respond ""Yes, Dad has come"" or “Yes, Mummy has come”). By doing this, you’re enriching her vocabulary and building her communication skills.</p>

<p>During this period, you may notice that she <strong>understands short instructions</strong> such as ""give it to your brother"", ""wave bye-bye"" or ""don’t touch it.""  Recognize her new understanding by giving her a big smile or praise.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>As when she was younger, your baby will probably still show some <strong>stranger anxiety.  </strong>She may still be <strong>scared and start to cry</strong> when you <strong>leave</strong> the room. As her emotional development progresses, she will become more and more <strong>aware</strong> of her <strong>needs</strong>.  And as she becomes better at communicating, she’ll be able to let you know her desires and feelings.</p>

<h3>            <strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p>Continue to reassure your baby if she avoids new people.  Give her everyday experiences in which you may leave briefly—even to get a toy from another room—and come back.  Games like hide-and-seek or peek-a-boo give practice in managing these feelings, too.  Whatever her feelings, listen and try to interpret her wishes and put those feelings into words for her (for example, “Oh, baby is so tired” or “Baby wants that spoon; let me get it for you.”)</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New? </strong></h3>

<p>Remember that your baby is in the process of <strong>learning</strong> all the time during this period.  Babies of this age love to find hidden objects under a blanket or a cup.  She also wants to discover how objects work - often by grabbing, shaking, hitting, throwing, or banging something on the ground (be sure objects are safe!). ... she will enjoy playing with the adults who look after her.  At the end of the first year she may also initiate the play - by showing you the toys with which she is playing.</p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p>Just as when she was younger, your baby will still learn best <strong>through play</strong>.  In <strong>Playing Together</strong> section, you’ll find many activities that your baby will love at this age.  Every child is unique, so follow her initiative and support her choice of toys and interests.  Simple everyday objects and activities will enrich her knowledge and thinking abilities. Read books, tell traditional stories, play music or sing songs, and recite nursery rhymes for her.  Let her turn over the pages of picture books.  Bathing or getting dressed are great times to help her point to body parts. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  Most likely, your baby will begin by  <strong>standing by holding onto something.  </strong>Then she may try <strong>standing independently </strong>and perhaps take to her <strong>first steps</strong>. Every child is different, but by the end of this period some babies may even <strong>walk on their own.  </strong>However, walking is a big challenge for babies, and some early walkers will still go back to crawling as an easier way to explore their world.  At the same time, she is becoming more skilled at using her hands and fingers to explore her environment.</p>

<h3><strong>And What Can You Do to Help?</strong></h3>

<p>You don’t need to teach a child to walk!  But do find fun, everyday ways to encourage her to move, so that she will build muscle strength for more complex movements.   Now that you have her on the go, check that your home is safe and secure for the little adventurer.  Her coordination and use of her hands are improving, too.  You can help by encouraging her to explore different textures of objects with her touch, or to bang one object against another, or to put them into boxes and take them out of them, or to gather food crumbs from the table. Give her crayons to scribble on paper.</p>

<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 10th to the 12th month </strong></h2>

<p>As when he was younger, your baby will probably still show some <strong>stranger anxiety.  </strong>He may still be <strong>scared and start to cry</strong> when you <strong>leave</strong> the room. As his emotional development progresses, he  will become more and more <strong>aware</strong> of his <strong>needs</strong>.  And as he becomes better at communicating, he’ll be able to let you know his desires and feelings.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Continue to reassure your baby if he avoids new people.  Give him everyday experiences in which you may leave briefly—even to get a toy from another room—and come back.  Games like hide-and-seek or peek-a-boo give practice in managing these feelings, too.  Whatever his feelings, listen and try to interpret his wishes and put those feelings into words for him (for example, “Oh, baby is so tired” or “Baby wants that spoon; let me get it for you.”</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New? </em></strong></h3>

<p>Remember that your baby is in the process of <strong>learning</strong> all the time during this period.  Babies of this age love to find hidden objects under a blanket or a cup.  He  also wants to discover how objects work - often by grabbing, shaking, hitting, throwing, or banging something on the ground (be sure objects are safe!). ... he will enjoy playing with the adults who look after him.  At the end of the first year he may also initiate the play - by showing you the toys with which he is playing.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Just as when he was younger, your baby will still learn best <strong>through play</strong>.  In <strong>Playing Together</strong> section, you’ll find many activities that your baby will love at this age.  Every child is unique, so follow his initiative and support his choice of toys and interests.  Simple everyday objects and activities will enrich his knowledge and thinking abilities.  Read books, tell traditional stories, play music or sing songs, and recite nursery rhymes for him.  Let him turn over the pages of picture books.  Bathing or getting dressed are great times to help him point to body parts. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>These months bring some exciting developments.  Most likely, your baby will begin by  <strong>standing by holding onto something.  </strong>Then he may try <strong>standing independently </strong>and perhaps take to his <strong>first steps</strong>. Every child is different, but by the end of this period some babies may even <strong>walk on their own.  </strong>However, walking is a big challenge for babies, and some early walkers will still go back to crawling as an easier way to explore their world.     At the same time, he is becoming more skilled at using his hands and fingers to explore his environment.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>You don’t need to teach a child to walk!  But do find fun, everyday ways to encourage him to move, so that he will build muscle strength for more complex movements.   Now that you have him on the go, check that your home is safe and secure for the little adventurer.  His coordination and use of his hands are improving, too.  You can help by encouraging him to explore different textures of objects with his touch, or to bang one object against another, or to put them into boxes and take them out of them, or to gather food crumbs from the table. Give him crayons to scribble on paper.</p>

<p>To find many more ways on how to support child development through play, go to <strong>Playing Together</strong> section.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 10th to the 12th month </strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child isn`t making eye contact with you or isn’t following moving objects with his eyes,</li>
	<li>is not interested in sounds,</li>
	<li>does not respond to his name when you call him,</li>
	<li>isn’t babbling,</li>
	<li>isn’t trying to let you know in any way what his desires or needs are,</li>
	<li>isn’t pointing to objects,</li>
	<li>isn’t showing emotions,</li>
	<li>isn’t crawling</li>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 13th to the 18th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>During these months, your baby will increase her understanding of speech.  And in a big accomplishment—she will probably say her very first words.  You will notice that she understands simple directions and instructions such as “Give me” or “Where is..?”  She may also name a familiar, favourite object.   Of course, she will continue to use a lot of pointing and babbling, but by the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> month, she will most likely use a few words to communicate with you. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Everyday activities give your baby new words to use.  While you are doing something together, explain  what you are doing (“Now we will get the dishes for our lunch”) and name the objects you are using (“Here is your hat!”).  Anything you are doing and talking about will be interesting to her.  As you talk with your baby, keep the conversation going by using short phrases and asking simple questions.  If she is trying to say something, you can help by finishing the word and expanding on it.   For example, if she says “block”, you can say ""Yes it’s a block—it’s a blue block!” </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Even though your baby wants to try to be independent, at this age she will usually prefer to explore the world with the support of close adults, with whom she feels safe.  Her smiles, hugs, and cuddles show the affection she has for parents and her other caregivers. If she gets briefly separated from these special adults, you will probably see—and hear--her become very upset.   You do not need to worry about this reaction; it is typical of most children at this age, and actually shows her deep attachment to you.  Other emotions begin to show themselves in this period.  For example, shame may appear in reaction to seeing others’ displeasure at something your baby has done.  She may also begin to show defiance if she has been told not to do something she wants to do. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Give your baby patient, loving attention when she follows directions or tries to manage difficult situations. Encourage her with approval, praise, reassurance, kisses and cuddling for her appropriate, desired behaviours. This will help her, gradually, learn what is expected of her.  If she is upset when you leave her, even briefly, reassure her, accept her emotions, and remind her that you always come back.  Continue to name her feelings and reflect them back to her:  “I know you are really sad because you cannot go outside now.  We will read a story and get ready for your nap now, and we will play outside later.” </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Your baby is just beginning to group things that are the same shape or colour.   She also is learning to follow simple instructions, if they have only one or two steps (“Here are your shoes and give them to me so we can go outside.” Her exploration becomes even more intense—she is interested in how all kinds of things work. </p>

<p>By the time your baby is 18 months old, you are likely to see “pretend play” appear.  She might pretend to talk on the phone or eat make-believe food, or feed a pretend animal.  Whatever she sees in her environment gives her ideas for pretend play.  All of this strengthens her ability to think creatively and to understand more about the world.  Your baby may also learn through being with other children, even if it is still just watching them as they play side by side. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Because your baby wants to understand what she can do with different things, she will probably enjoy games such as finding a hidden object, pointing to body parts or familiar objects already known to her. The games will be more fun and lead to even more learning if you take turns (me and then you).  For example, this could be throwing a ball, turning pages in a book (one page for me, one page for you), showing different objects (this one for me and this one for you) or games imitating everyday actions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>In this period, your child may be able to stand alone without help and without holding on to something.  Many children take their first steps in this period.  Children of the same age develop differently, but during this period, some children already start running, climbing furniture, or walking up and down stairs if these are in a child’s environment.   Skills like these help your baby become more independent and give her more ways to actively explore the world in which she lives. </p>

<p>During this period, your baby will find it easier than before to use her hands skilfully for many things.  These might include scribbling with a pencil, turning pages in a book or magazine, using a spoon, holding a cup while drinking, or stacking up objects to make a simple tower. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Everyday activities will be the best way to give your baby opportunities to practice her developing physical skills.  If possible, take her outdoors for active play with you—watching her closely for safety.  Ask her to help you do things like opening doors or carrying small items (if she is walking).  Get involved in her activities!  Sing songs together, especially those that have accompanying movements (e.g. singing and touching head, shoulders, knees and toes).  You may know traditional songs and games to teach your baby.</p>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 19th to the 24th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>Children of this age enjoy talking, although it is still a combination of real words and babbling.  At this age, speech development is very rapid.  Children may learn 1 to 2 new words a week, or even more.  Your child will already be able to point at familiar objects, people or body parts during this period.  During this period, your child understands more and more: she recognizes her name and understands the idea of ""mine."" She is getting better at understanding short sentences and instructions such as ""Bring it to mom"" or “Bring it to daddy.”   By the end of the second year most children will be able to use  ""I"" and ""you"" and say a sentence with 2 to 3 words (for example ""Dad car"" or ""Me do it""). </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>               Lessons are not important—conversation and play are what your child needs!  Talk to your child during daily routines such as dressing, feeding, walking, or bathing.  Your everyday conversation will enrich your child’s vocabulary.   During your busy day, just listen to what your child says and respond by saying a bit more.  If she says, ""Mom milk"" or “Dad milk”, you may build on what she said by replying, ""Oh, do you want me to get you some milk?""     </p>

<p>Read or tell stories to your child every day and talk about pictures or objects using simple words.  Encourage her to point to pictures in books or other things she sees, and to use words to describe what she sees.  Ask her simple questions and encourage her answers even if they are hard to understand.  Use games to teach her to name body parts, animals and objects for everyday use. Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.  </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>At this age, your child begins to experience more complex feelings-- anger or frustration, guilt, shame, or intense excitement.  These kinds of feelings can be hard for her to deal with. As a result, at this age children often experience a kind of explosion of feelings (a temper tantrum). Children handle intense feelings in different ways, but some may react by crying, screaming, kicking, falling down, or even running out of the room or vomiting. </p>

<p> At this period of development, your child begins to be able to communicate her feelings in simple language and gestures.  She may recognize and even say that ""she is sad"" or hug and kiss you, to show comfort and reassurance. </p>

<p>At the same time, social and emotional skills are growing.  If she has a chance, she probably enjoys being near other children and playing beside them (although probably not interacting or cooperating in their play just yet).   </p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Describe the feelings that the child expresses or encounters in everyday life or stories.  Try to prevent tantrums through distraction, calming activities, or other ways of soothing her.  Praise positive behaviour more than depending mainly on punishment.  Praise means a lot to her.  If tantrums occur, try to stay calm, protect her from harm, and help her learn how to regain control.</p>

<p>Build her emotional security by asking your child to help you—for example by bringing you something, putting a toy back in its place, turning the page of the book you are looking at together, or helping with simple household chores.  At the same time, she is learning to communicate, reason, and develop physical skills. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>You will notice that your child is beginning to be able to follow a simple direction, perhaps one with two steps (“Pick up your toy and bring to mom (or dad), please”).  She enjoys finding things that are hidden and remembers where objects were before.  She also begins to put objects in groups, such as items that are the same colour or shape.  </p>

<p>You will see your child get more and more involved in ""pretend play.""  At first, she may just pretend to eat or drink.  As time goes on, her make-believe becomes even more complex—perhaps she pretends that a piece of cloth is a baby that she hugs, pats, and feeds!  Creative thinking and problem solving are developed through this kind of play. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p> Everyday activities help her learn these and other skills.  As you go through your day, ask her simple questions and show enjoyment of her answers.  She can learn body parts as you bathe, comb hair, and dress.  Teach her to name body parts, animals and things for everyday use. Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.   Remember that play continues to be the most important way for her to learn.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>By this age, your child will most likely walk independently.  This is exciting for her and for you!  She will also begin to explore and increase her skills in other kinds of movement, such as running and kicking a ball. Depending on the environment, these may also include walking up and downstairs or climbing onto or down from furniture.</p>

<p>You may also see her independence in wanting to dress or undress herself, or to do other things that are new and physically challenging.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>At this age, your child needs a responsible adult nearby while she is playing actively, running, or jumping.   Help her with new physical challenges like getting down from furniture or holding on while climbing stairs.  Keeping your eye on her actions, you will encourage her to try out new ways of moving while you also give her a sense of safety and security. </p>

<p>You can encourage independence in dressing by making it easier for her.  At the beginning, children find it easier to undress than to get dressed (as you often see at inconvenient times!).  At nap- or bedtime, encourage her to participate by taking off socks, shoes, or clothes that do not require unbuttoning<strong>. </strong></p>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 19th to the 24th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>Children of this age enjoy talking, although it is still a combination of real words and babbling.  At this age, speech development is very rapid.  Children may learn 1 to 2 new words a week, or even more.  Your child will already be able to point at familiar objects, people or body parts during this period.  During this period, your child understands more and more: he recognizes his name and understands the idea of ""mine."" He is getting better at understanding short sentences and instructions such as ""Bring it to mom"" or “Bring it to daddy.”   By the end of the second year most children will be able to use  ""I"" and ""you"" and say a sentence with 2 to 3 words (for example ""Dad car"" or ""Me do it""). </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>               Lessons are not important—conversation and play are what your child needs!  Talk to your child during daily routines such as dressing, feeding, walking, or bathing.  Your everyday conversation will enrich your child’s vocabulary.   During your busy day, just listen to what your child says and respond by saying a bit more.  If he says, ""Mom milk"" or “Dad milk”, you may build on what he said by replying, ""Oh, do you want me to get you some milk?""     </p>

<p>Read or tell stories to your child every day and talk about pictures or objects using simple words.  Encourage him to point to pictures in books or other things he sees, and to use words to describe what he sees.  Ask him simple questions and encourage his answers even if they are hard to understand.  Use games to teach him to name body parts, animals and objects for everyday use. Play animal sound games. Sing nursery rhymes together.  </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>At this age, your child begins to experience more complex feelings-- anger or frustration, guilt, shame, or intense excitement.  These kinds of feelings can be hard for him to deal with. As a result, at this age children often experience a kind of explosion of feelings (a temper tantrum). Children handle intense feelings in different ways, but some may react by crying, screaming, kicking, falling down, or even running out of the room or vomiting. </p>

<p> At this period of development, your child begins to be able to communicate his feelings in simple language and gestures.  He may recognize and even say that ""he is sad"" or hug and kiss you to show comfort and reassurance. </p>

<p>At the same time, social and emotional skills are growing.  If he has a chance, he probably enjoys being near other children and playing beside them (although probably not interacting or cooperating in their play just yet).   </p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Describe the feelings that the child expresses or encounters in everyday life or stories.  Try to prevent tantrums through distraction, calming activities, or other ways of soothing him.  Praise positive behaviour more than depending mainly on punishment.  Praise means a lot to him.  If tantrums occur, try to stay calm, protect him from harm, and help him learn how to regain control.</p>

<p>Build his emotional security by asking your child to help you—for example by bringing you something, putting a toy back in its place, turning the page of the book you are looking at together, or helping with simple household chores.  At the same time, he is learning to communicate, reason, and develop physical skills. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>You will notice that your child is beginning to be able to follow a simple direction, perhaps one with two steps (“Pick up your toy and bring to mom (or dad), please”).  He enjoys finding things that are hidden and remembers where objects were before.  He also begins to put objects in groups, such as items that are the same colour or shape.  </p>

<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 25th to 36th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>During this age, your child’s <strong>vocabulary </strong>is getting richer every day. At this age, most children can compose <strong>sentences</strong> of 2 to 5 words, and it is easier to understand what your child is saying to you.  She will slowly learn how to listen and wait for her turn and will be able to keep up a <strong>short conversation</strong>.  During this period, your child learns how to <strong>describe things</strong> that have happened during the day.  With a little help from you, she can even begin to tell a simple story in sequence.  How exciting for her and for you! </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>               Establish a shared reading time with your child and allow her to turn the pages of a picture book by herself. Teach your child simple songs and rhymes, perhaps from your own childhood or traditions. Ask your child to show you things in pictures and encourage her to repeat the words after you, even if it doesn’t sound much like your pronunciation.  Your child will be interested in the names of things.  Try to not just say the name, but some descriptive words (like ""yes, it’s a big blue truck,” or “Ball—the ball is big, isn’t it?”). </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p> </p>

<p>This is a <strong>very important period for your child`s emotional development</strong>. Your child experiences lots of feelings every day—from intense happiness to sadness, frustration, and, sometimes, anger.  At the same time, she is learning about <strong>other people`s feelings</strong>, including the <strong>beginnings of empathy</strong>--feeling the way someone else may be feeling.   As when she was younger, she still may have some angry outbursts or temper tantrums.  She still has a <strong>hard time putting big feelings into words</strong>.  During this period, your child will also begin to understand how her behavior affects yours, and also how your behavior affects her.  Now she is apt to be less worried about <strong>separating </strong>from you, although it may still be hard at times, and every child is different. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Talk with your child about feelings, tell stories or read age-appropriate books about all kinds of emotions.  Encourage her to make believe about emotions with her toys or other objects.  Accept that she still cannot manage her big feelings sometimes and use your calmness to create a secure environment for her.  And playing, especially make-believe play, is a wonderful way for her to understand and cope with feelings.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Your child is slowly beginning to understand <strong>important ideas like time</strong> (such as day and night, before and after) <strong>and opposites</strong> (big and small).  Also, in this period, she will probably show you that she understands the <strong>purposes of different parts of her body</strong> (“I see with my eyes”).  She begins to try <strong>grouping   objects</strong> by colour, size or shape. She will also start <strong>solving simple problems through trial and error</strong>—“If the spoon doesn’t fit in the jar, maybe I can try a smaller one.”</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Remember that your child continues to learn best through exploration and play.  New concepts can be explored by using objects and by playing pretend.  Encourage your child to play lots of “pretend games” and sometimes join in the game your child is leading.  Continue to involve her in everyday experiences that let you explore together and try out new things:  “Let’s plant some flowers today!”  or “Can you find a good place to put those cups? Thank you!”</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your child is becoming <strong>much more independent</strong>. During this period, your child can get dressed and undressed on her own—not perfectly, of course-- wash her hands or eat by herself. An important aspect of becoming independent is the use of the toilet.  In many cultures and families, this typically begins during this time. Your child’s  <strong>movements are more complex</strong> than earlier. By the end of the third year of life your child can probably <strong>run and jump</strong>, stand on one leg, go up and downstairs (if home has stairs), and maybe <strong>try to ride</strong> a small scooter or tricycle if available.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Your child will be eager to try new things but she needs for your support. Encourage her to try, whether or not she is successful at first—and celebrate new skills.  You can also build skills and confidence by including her in everyday family chores—helping sort clean socks, shopping trips, stirring food for a meal, and other simple tasks that fascinate her.</p>

<p>If you are nearby, your child will be more willing to try to climb, hop, draw, throw a ball, or explore other new challenges.  Just by your presence, you are creating a secure environment for development. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your child is becoming <strong>much more independent</strong>. During this period, your child can get dressed and undressed on his own—not perfectly, of course-- wash his hands or eat by himself. An important aspect of becoming independent is the use of the toilet.  In many cultures and families, this typically begins during this time. Your child’s  <strong>movements are more complex</strong> than earlier. By the end of the third year of life your child can probably <strong>run and jump</strong>, stand on one leg, go up and downstairs (if home has stairs), and maybe <strong>try to ride</strong> a small scooter or tricycle if available.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Your child will be eager to try new things but he needs for your support. Encourage him to try, whether or not he is successful at first—and celebrate new skills.  You can also build skills and confidence by including him in everyday family chores—helping sort clean socks, shopping trips, stirring food for a meal, and other simple tasks that fascinate him.</p>

<p>If you are nearby, your child will be more willing to try to climb, hop, draw, throw a ball, or explore other new challenges.  Just by your presence, you are creating a secure environment for development. </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 25th to the 36th month </strong></h2>

<p>Because each child develops in his own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period  give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if his development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills he had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Doesn’t look at you (eye contact)</li>
	<li>has difficulties hearing or seeing some things  </li>
	<li>doesn’t speak in short sentences (at least 3 words together)  </li>
	<li>has very unclear speech  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>doesn’t follow simple instructions  </li>
	<li>doesn’t want to play with other children or with toys and other objects</li>
	<li>doesn’t make-believe or pretend during play  </li>
	<li>cannot run  </li>
	<li>isn’t scribbling or drawing  </li>
	<li>cannot hold small objects in his hand.  </li>

3556,Activity: Treasure hunt,"This activity encourages the child's curiosity and stimulates her desire to explore. At the same time, it enables her to develop fine motor skills, including hand and finger movements, that are important for this age. If you explain everything while playing, this activity can significantly enrich your child's vocabulary and give her the opportunity to try to pronounce new words.","<p><strong>You will need: </strong>an ordinary box or a plastic container, shredded paper (newspaper, paper towels or other paper cut into strips, small toys or other small objects (safe for a child) that you have around your home. </p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Put the objects or toys in the box together with the shredded paper so that the toys are hidden from view. Attract your child's attention with a friendly facial expression saying, ""Look what I have! Treasure!”, and then ask her to try to find the hidden things. Give her a simple instruction, “Find a...” or “Where is the...?”. Allow her to touch both the paper and hidden objects and to enjoy exploring. When she finds one of the precious items, always name the treasure ""And here is the..."". Follow the child's reaction and describe what you see, ""You like it!"", ""You want to find more!"", or praise her success. Support her if she wants to say what she found. Continue until all the treasure in the box is discovered.

3561,Activity: Ball in the basket,"The throwing movement is very important because it enables the practice of balance and coordination. It strengthens the muscles important for the further development of the child's motor skills in this period. It gives the child the opportunity to assess and learn about the relations of objects in space. If you take turns throwing, you give your toddler the opportunity to develop the concept of sharing with others, i.e. ""your turn"" which is an important aspect of socio-emotional development.","<p><strong>You will need: </strong>one soft ball, but rolled-up socks can also be used; a large box or a washbasin or a large basket  </p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Place the box or basket in the room and position yourself at a short distance from it. In order to attract your child's attention, you can be the first to throw the ball in the basket and accompany this with happy cheers.  Stand close and make it easy.  When she gets interested, let her try it herself. For some children during this period, the expectation to throw the ball into the basket can be too demanding.  Even if they aren't successful in throwing into the basket, the value and enjoyment of this activity is in practising the throwing movement.  Reward each attempt with praise, a smile, applause and encouragement. Try to take turns throwning (you can say ""Now it's my turn!  Now it's your turn!"" and other language such as ""That was a big throw!"" or ""Oh, the ball went onto the couch; let's get it!"") and cheer for every attempt regardless of success.  </p>",3191,55,"49,50",59,60,"4846, 4851, 4856, 4861",,0,0,,en,published
3566,Activity: Imitation,"This activity will encourage the development of facial expressions and strengthen the facial muscles.

Ultimately, it encourages bonding with you and ensures that your child staying focused.","<p><strong>You will need:</strong> time, an opportunity to be face-to -face with your child </p>

<p><strong>How to play:</strong> For this activity you may use all the free moments when you are face to face with your child - such as changing diapers, etc. Attract your child's attention by asking ""What kind of face does a … have?"" and then make a specific facial expression, for example like a fish: suck in your cheeks and move your pursed lips like a fish or, for example, like a bunny: twitch your nose like a bunny… There can also be different facial expressions - angry, sad, scared but also head movements – nodding, turning the head from side to side, hand movements - patting, waving… Wait for your child to look at your action long enough and try to imitate it. Be patient and repeat a movement or facial expression. Give your child a short instruction she can understand - ""Come on, you try it!"" or (if your child is a bit older), ""Can you open your mouth like a fish?  Let me see!""  and thereby encourage her. When your child repeats an expression or movement, always name what she did, because in that way you will encourage speech development. You should also imitate your child’s movements or expressions and give them a name.  You will also be helping your child to follow very simple directions, an important step in the development of your child's thinking.</p>",2711,55,"47,48,49",59,60,"4866, 981",,0,0,,en,published
3571,Activity: Drawing with water,"This activity is important for the development of motor skills, both gross - because it requires movement in space (if you do it outside) and fine, if you give the child a brush or a small object for painting.

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> It's time for a little bouncing. Keep your baby upright by holding her hands over a soft surface (preferably a mattress or other soft surface, or on your lap). Turn her so that you face each other and show her how much you enjoy this game. Follow her reactions. Your baby's legs at this age still can't bear her weight, so don't let her lean on them completely, you need to hold her well while he bends her legs bouncing. As long as she smiles, squeals or shows joy, repeat this ""bouncing"".

3591,Activity: Reading with your baby,"By reading, parents produce many more words than the baby hears in everyday speech.

Through this activity, the baby practises both reaching for objects and manipulating them.","<p><strong>You will need: </strong>a baby book (made of cloth or with a hardcover, brightly coloured pictures and tactile elements).  If you don't have one, you may use plain paper folded in half on which you can draw a few pictures or shapes in bright colours. </p>

<p><strong>How to do it: </strong>Put the baby on your lap so that you can look at the book together, but you should also be able to see your baby’s face. Place the book so that you can both see it and then read it! You can describe what is in the picture or tell a story about it, point your finger at the pictures and name them.

In this way, your baby will grow up feeling safe, protected and loved, which is a prerequisite for healthy development.","<p><strong>You will need:</strong> just your arms and a soothing voice </p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Your baby may cry in different ways and by crying he may try to convey different messages. During this period, you may notice that the baby begins to be upset when new, unknown people appear, which was not the case before. This is quite expected. Help her first by always introducing new people gradually and not abruptly and, if possible, in an already familiar environment. Always be with your baby when a new face approaches or addresses her, and if anxiety and crying increase - calm her down. Speak to your baby in a calm voice, holding her in your arms to reassure her that you will not leave her. You can gently rock her, hug her or sing to her. Watch closely to see when your baby is ready for the challenge of making friends again.

3606,Short stature,"<p>""A child has short stature (his/her length is small for the age of up to 2 years) if the values of his/her length/height are below -2 SD relative to the average values for healthy children of the same age and sex.""</p>","<p>Parents are very interested to know if their child's height is appropriate for the age.</p>

<p>If your child seems to be shorter than his/her peers, you will measure him/her yourself more often and, of course, consult a pediatrician.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>As part of regular preventive examinations in the pediatric clinic, all children's body length/height is measured and entered in the growth chart, which clearly shows how the child's measured value compares to the values for healthy children of the same age and sex.  </li>
	<li>In our country, growth charts (graphs) are used; they represent the growth standards set on the basis of research within the World Health Organization.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When is a child short for age?</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For children under the age of 2, body length is measured in a lying position, and from the age of two, their body height is measured in a standing position.</li>
	<li>The boundary between normal and short stature is not sharp because it is based on an arbitrarily set criterion.</li>
	<li>A child whose body length/height is 2 SD below the average for healthy children of the same age and sex has short stature by these standards.</li>
	<li>If the child's body height is in the range between -2 and -3 SD, the child is considered to be moderately stunted, and if it is below -3 SD - severely stunted.   </li>
	<li>In this regard, children older than 4 years with normal height inconsistent with the parents' height or with a low growth rate, below 4.5 cm per year, may also be considered to have a growth disorder.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Causes of short stature</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Most children in developed countries have a physiological form of short stature termed ""normal short stature"" because there are no other signs of health disorders, and the child's height is consistent with the height and growth pattern of parents or other close relatives (familial short stature).</li>
	<li>In a small number of children, the causes are: genetic disorders, hormone secretion disorders, as well as various chronic diseases of the intestines, kidneys, heart, lungs; high-dose corticosteroid therapy. </li>
	<li>In underdeveloped countries around the world, malnutrition, due to insufficient food intake in terms of adequate amount and content and/or frequent infections, is the leading cause of short stature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the measurements, examination of the child, history taking, especially data on the height of parents and close relatives, the pediatrician will assess whether to give specific recommendations and continue to monitor the child's growth or to undertake more detailed examinations.</p>

<ul>
	<li>In exploring the causes of short stature, in addition to looking for other signs of health impairments, it is important for the doctor to have access to the child's height figures for at least 2 preceding years.  </li>
</ul>

3611,Developmental delay,"<p>Developmental delay is present when children acquire motor, emotional, social and communication skills more slowly than expected.</p>","<p>Every child develops differently, which means that ""normal"" development, when it comes to the period of early childhood, is very widely understood. We are concerned about developmental delays, if we notice that over several months, children's communication, speech, motor or social skills do not develop at the same rate as their peers.</p>

<p>A developmental delay can occur in individual areas or in multiple areas. When it occurs in multiple areas, it is also called a general developmental delay.</p>

<p>Developmental delays may be transient and present in a specific period of development or, sometimes, may be the first sign of a longer-term developmental problem. Developmental delays that are present for an extended period of time (or permanently) are sometimes called developmental disabilities. Examples of such conditions are learning difficulties, cerebral palsy, intellectual development difficulties, autism spectrum disorder.</p>

<p>Experts most commonly use the term developmental delay while trying to determine the possible causes of the delay. If and when the cause is determined, then the name of the appropriate condition is used, which explains the child's condition in more detail.</p>

<h2><strong>Signs of a developmental delay </strong></h2>

<p>You are concerned about a possible delay in your child's development - what to do?</p>

<ul>
	<li>As a parent, you know your child best.</li>
	<li>If you are concerned about your child's development, consult your pediatrician.</li>
	<li>Health professionals and services can perform the necessary examinations to assess the presence of developmental delays. Sometimes a referral to other services for additional examinations may be necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Professionals who help children with developmental delays</strong></h2>

<p>In addition to health services (pediatrician and doctors of other specialties, nurses), many other professions are involved in conducting the necessary assessments and providing assistance to children with developmental delays and their families: special educator, speech therapist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, social worker.</p>

<p>Types of assistance are informed by delay characteristics.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is always necessary for the assistance to take place through the partnership of parents and professionals.</li>
	<li>In addition to working directly with the child, the professional's role is always to help you better understand your child and/or to improve your development stimulation skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The needs of children whose development takes place differently</strong></h2>

<p>Like all other children, children with developmental delays progress in development and learning. It takes more time to acquire new skills. The way they learn something new may be a little different and require additional support.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Most children learn new skills easily and by example. Children with developmental delays often need a more gradual approach and learning through handling smaller demands. This would mean that new demands sometimes need to be divided into several smaller steps, which are mastered one by one.</li>
	<li>It often takes more time for new skills to be fully adopted. It is, therefore, very important that the child has enough opportunities to apply these skills in different situations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>At preschool or school age, additional assistance may be needed as well. It is best to talk about this with professional service providers, in order to agree on support measures.</li>
	<li>In case of some conditions involving more pronounced difficulties, other types of support (e.g. financial support) may be available as well.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>When a child has a developmental delay, providing assistance may often require a lot of extra effort on your part and lead to exhaustion.  Remember that taking care of yourself, your health and well-being and finding personal support are just as important as taking care of your child. If you are well, you will be able to take better care of your child.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Causes of developmental delays:</strong></h2>

<p>There are many different causes that can lead to developmental delays.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some causes are genetic in nature, sometimes they are complications during pregnancy or childbirth. As regards developmental delays of shorter duration, the causes can be physical illnesses, a long stay in hospital, and stress in the family. Sometimes developmental delays are a result of insufficient stimulation and neglect of the child's needs.</li>
	<li>In many cases, causes of developmental delays are unknown.</li>
	<li>In each individual case, it is necessary to perform the necessary examinations of the child, in order to try to discover the causes of developmental delays.</li>

3616,Behavioral habits,"<p>Many children have habits such as nail biting, thumb sucking, or nose picking. Most often, such habits go away on their own. Sometimes a child needs help to break them. A way to achieve that is calmly reminding a child, with praise when he/she is not doing it.</p>","<h2><strong>What are habits?</strong></h2>

<p>Habits are behaviors that are repeated frequently, mostly automatically, without prior thinking. Some of these behaviors in children can sometimes worry, annoy or anger you, but you should know that they are usually not a cause for concern.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Children's habits often involve touching or similar useless activities with parts of the face or body. Children may be aware of this, they may like it, but this is not always the case.</li>
	<li>Some of the most common habits are: sucking the finger, thumb or pacifier, biting or tearing the nails, twisting or pulling the hair, picking the nose, biting the lips or the inside of the cheeks, biting objects such as pencil ends, clothes, gnashing the teeth.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How do habits develop?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Habits can be pleasant and soothing. Sucking is one such example. In young children, this habit can be a way to relieve stress or anxiety.</li>
	<li>Sometimes, habits develop when children get bored. Such behaviors then serve as a kind of entertainment. For instance, children may bite their nails more often while watching TV or doing nothing than when they are anxious.</li>
	<li>Sometimes habits start for practical reasons, and then continue even when those reasons are no longer present. For instance, young children who pick their noses during a cold may continue to do so for some time when the cold passes. If a child picks his/her nose, even after learning to empty it by blowing it, he/she has probably developed the habit of picking.</li>
	<li>You set an example for the child. If you notice that a child is starting to form a habit, first ask yourself if you have such a habit. Some habits are more likely to occur in certain families, e.g. nail biting.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Some children may exhibit more unusual behaviors, such as swaying their body, hitting or moving their head. Most children stop doing this by the age of five.</p>

<p>Some behaviors may look like the beginning of a habit, and are caused by medical reasons. In this case, they usually start abruptly and have other characteristics, e.g. a child who suddenly starts pulling or hitting the earlobes and becomes irritable is likely to have an ear infection. It can be similar with some behaviors accompanying tooth growth, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Breaking habits</strong></h2>

<p>Most of these behaviors stop on their own. If the behaviors interfere with the child's daily functioning, or lead to injury, then something needs to be done.</p>

<p>For instance, thumb sucking is common and quite normal. But, if the child sucks his/her thumb most of the time or has difficulties because of it, e.g. in talking or eating, or is insulted by peers, then it is advisable to stop these behaviors. Try it yourself first:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make an agreement with your child that you will help break the habit. Explain why you are doing this.</li>
	<li>When you notice the child doing it, calmly tell him/her to stop. Praise him/her when he/she does.</li>
	<li>If such behaviors occur more often when the child is not active, you can suggest an activity.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these habits do not stop despite your efforts, and interfere with functioning or lead to injury (e.g. intense finger sucking can adversely affect tooth development, if it lasts beyond the third year), seek professional help. In case it is suspected that those behaviors are a manifestation of anxiety, it is necessary to seek psychological help.</p>

<p>Sometimes these behaviors look like tics. Tics are involuntary, repetitive and sudden movements. They occur for other reasons. Most tics involve simple movements (squinting, more frequent blinking, nose twitching, etc.) They are usually temporary. If they last longer, if they are pronounced or more complex in nature, it is necessary to consult a pediatrician.</p>",936,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,,,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/common-concerns/habits"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/behaviour/common-concerns/habits</a></p>",en,published

3636,Stimulating socio-emotional development: 3 -6 months,Close people and time with them are sources of the most important experiences when it comes to socio-emotional development at this age.,"<h3><strong>Babies need to see your face, hear your voice and feel your closeness</strong></h3>

<p>• Look at the baby, talk by addressing her, name body parts, sing, smile. Make faces and notice how the baby reacts. Sometimes they will imitate you. Routines, such as changing diapers and feeding, are daily opportunities and don't miss them.</p>

<p>• When you talk and sing to the baby, hearing your voice further encourages the development of connections between brain cells. Your voice will encourage the baby to react - he can watch you carefully, smile, respond with voices or body movements. Enjoy it, the baby will feel your joy. You can also play nice music, but it can't replace your voice.</p>

<p>• Hold the baby in your arms, touch and cuddle her. When she is in your arms, the baby feels loved and safe. Don’t be afraid to spoil her. When the baby feels safe with you, then he is calm and curious, more ready to explore the world and new impressions.</p>

<h3><strong>Observe and react to the expressed feelings in the child</strong></h3>

<p>• The child recognizes your feelings and reactions and he reacts to them. Both - the emotional states of the child and your reaction are a whole. Your reactions help the child to regulate the strength of feelings, resolve discomfort and gain trust in the relationship with you.</p>

<p>• Express feelings when you are with your child, gently and noticing how your child reacts. Name the feelings you recognize in the child. Show joy while you are with the child and tell the child how much you love him.</p>

<p>• Notice when your baby is looking at you or trying to reach you, because that means he wants contact with you. Respond to that. Your reactions help your baby recognize his aspirations and discover that you are capable of it as well. That is how he feels important, safe and loved.</p>

<p>• Sometimes your baby is in a bad mood or experiencing unpleasant feelings. Your support and help are needed to make the condition more bearable or to eliminate the causes. Your composure and calmness, gentle movements and voice, mean a lot to your baby.</p>",251,6,"45,46",59,60,,,0,1,"<p>Reference:</p>

3671,Bathing a newborn,"Bathing a newborn can be tricky at first, especially if your newborn seems unhappy in the bath. A few simple steps can make bath time enjoyable and easy for you and your baby.","<h2>How often to give your newborn a bath</h2>

<p>A bath <strong>2-3 times a week</strong> is enough to keep your newborn clean. But if your baby really likes baths, you may bath him even more often. Too often bathing (more than once daily) can dry out your baby’s skin.</p>

<p>You can keep your baby’s genitals clean between baths by using warm water and cotton wool.</p>

<p>About 5-10 minutes is long enough for a newborn bath. This is especially important if your baby has dry or sensitive skin.</p>

<p>A ‘top and tail’ bath is when you use cotton wool and warm water for your baby’s eyes and face, and a washcloth for her hands and bottom. ‘Topping and tailing’ means you can concentrate on the areas that really need a wash, and your baby can keep most of her clothes on while you do it.</p>

<h2>When and where to give your newborn a bath</h2>

<p>You can bath your baby at any time of the day. It’s a good idea to pick a time when you’re relaxed and you won’t be interrupted. And it’s best to avoid bathing your baby when he’s hungry or straight after a feed.</p>

<p>If your baby likes a bath and it seems to relax her, you can use bathing as a way to help settle her for sleep in the evening.</p>

<p>You can give your newborn a bath in a small plastic bath or even in the kitchen sink. A plastic baby bath is probably the best option once your baby gets bigger.</p>

<h2>Setting up a newborn bath: tips</h2>

<p>Here’s how to get ready for a newborn bath:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Take the phone off the hook or turn your phone off while bathing baby.</strong> You’ll be less likely to get distracted.</li>
	<li>Make sure you have everything you need at hand – for example, towel, washcloth, lotion, clean clothes and clean nappy. <strong>Avoid using soap</strong> because this will dry out your baby’s skin. If needed, use a gentle non-soap cleanser or fragrance-free oil.</li>
	<li>Position the bath somewhere stable and at a height where you can comfortably hold your baby. A kitchen table is often best.</li>
	<li>Fill the bath with about 5 cm of water for babies up to six months old. Use jugs of water to fill the bath if you’re planning to bath your baby away from the tap.</li>
	<li>Take off your watch and jewellery and wash your hands.</li>
	<li><strong>Check the water temperature is 37-38°C</strong> before you put your baby in. If you don’t have a thermometer, use your wrist or elbow to test the temperature – it should be comfortably warm, not hot.</li>
	<li>Before bathing your baby in a sink, briefly run cold water through the tap once you’ve finished filling the bath.</li>
	<li>Don’t add extra water while your baby is in the bath.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Giving your newborn a bath: </h2>

<p>Bathing your baby takes practice, so try to relax and take your time. You might like to start by bathing your baby when someone else is around to help. If you’re worried about losing your grip on your baby, you can make the bath less slippery by lining it with a clean cloth nappy or towel.</p>

<p>Children can drown in a few seconds in very shallow water. <strong>Never leave your baby alone in the bath</strong>, even if you’re using a bath seat or cradle. Never leave older children or siblings to supervise. If you’re disturbed by the phone or another task, take your baby out of the bath.</p>

<p>It’s normal for newborns to find bath time distressing at first. But most babies quickly learn to like bath time. To help your baby enjoy bath time, you can try placing your hand gently on his tummy. This can help your baby feel safe and secure in the bath.</p>

<p>If your baby doesn’t like baths, give her a ‘top and tail’ bath one day and a proper bath the next. By around three months, it’s likely your baby will love the bath.</p>",6151,2,"43,44,45",59,60,"4781, 1341, 341, 131",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/hygiene-keeping-clean/bathing-a-newborn"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/newborns/health-daily-care/hygiene-keeping-clean/bathing-a-newborn</a></p>",en,published

<p>3. If you are too unwell to breastfeed, there are other ways to safely provide your baby with breast milk, including expressing milk and donor human milk, if available in your area. Ask your breastfeeding counselor or healthcare professional to guide you through options available.

3791,Does the COVID-19 pandemic affect baby friendly hospitals?,"<p>In many countries, due to isolation measures and fear, the pandemic has compromised perinatal care and breastfeeding support practices.</p>","<p>Mothers, families and professionals face great challenges.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization has recommended that a postpartum woman with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection (with a milder clinical picture or uncomplicated pneumonia):</p>

<ul>
	<li>can breastfeed her baby, or express in order to feed the baby her milk. The application of all hygienic measures to prevent the transmission of infection is required.</li>
	<li>can have ""skin to skin"" contact with the newborn (with all the recommended measures to prevent the transmission of infection).</li>
</ul>

<p>These recommendations have not been adopted by all countries. In some countries, a COVID-19-positive mother is separated from the child immediately after birth, regardless of the clinical picture of the disease. The fear of possible exposure of the newborn or health workers to the infection precluded mother-child proximity, breastfeeding the child and skin-to-skin contact. </p>

<p>The situation with the COVID-19 infection has just begun, but we must learn how to progress and how to improve the way we fight it, while preserving the humanization and quality of newborn care in the near future and for other pandemics that may befall us. <br />
Breastmilk protects against morbidity and death in the period after birth and during childhood. It has a long-lasting effect on the child's immune system. The protective effect is especially strong against infectious diseases that are prevented by direct transmission of antibodies and other anti-infective factors. </p>

<p>The skin-to-skin contact procedure improves the regulation of body temperature and regulates the newborn's blood sugar level, reduces stress in the mother and newborn, and contributes to emotional attachment and breastfeeding success.<br />

2.    Može da dobije novorođenče „ koža na kožu“ (uz primenu svih preporučenih mera za sprečavanje prenosa infekcije). </p>

<p>Ove preporuke nisu usvojile sve zemlje. U nekim zemljama je Covid pozitivna majka odmah nakon porođaja odvojena od deteta, bez obzira na kliničku sliku bolesti. Strah od mogućeg izlaganja infekciji novorođenčeta ili zdravstvenih radnika je sprečio blizinu majke i deteta , ishranu  deteta na dojci i kontakt koža i kožu. <br />

<p>It is recommended that a COVID-positive mother with a milder clinical picture continue the care and breastfeeding of the child, while following specific hygienic measures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Air the room for 10 minutes every 2 hours.</li>
	<li>Regularly clean and disinfect the surfaces that she touches.</li>
	<li>A clean mask should be worn over the nose and mouth while caring for and breastfeeding the child. The mask should be changed every 2 hours and as soon as it becomes wet. When removing the mask, the part that was adjacent to the face should not be touched. The used mask should be discarded and must not be re-used. Hands must be washed after putting on the mask.</li>
	<li>Hands should be washed with water and soap for 20 seconds before each contact with the child. </li>
	<li>It is not necessary to wash the breasts before and after breastfeeding. It is enough to maintain body hygiene by showering regularly and changing the nightgown frequently. If the breasts are exposed to secretions while coughing, they must be washed with soap and water.</li>
	<li>If the infected mother is without respiratory symptoms, and the baby is in the same room, the crib should be 2 m away from her bed and a divider screen should be put in between.</li>
	<li>If the mother coughs or sneezes, she should preferably not be in the same room as the child. When entering the postpartum woman's room, the child's caregiver should wear a protective mask.</li>
	<li>The infected mother should cough or sneeze into a paper tissue, which will immediately be discarded into a bin with a lid. After that, hand washing with water and soap for 20 seconds is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the mother does not feel well enough to breastfeed the child (malaise, mild respiratory problems, temperature up to 38.5 °C), she should be provided assistance in expressing, in order for the newborn to be fed her milk. Once her clinical condition has improved, she can continue breastfeeding. Expressing also requires the mother to adhere to specific hygiene measures. </p>

<ul>
	<li>A clean mask should be worn over the nose and mouth.</li>
	<li>Hands should be washed with water and soap for 20 seconds before each expressing session. </li>
	<li>Expressing with a washed and sterilized pump is preferred over hand expression, as milk is less likely to be contaminated.</li>
</ul>

3981,Specific features of baby skin,"<p>Baby skin - pink, soft, smooth - puts a smile on one's face and instills the need to touch.</p>","<p>A newborn's skin is thin and sensitive, covered with an oily layer called vernix; it is not developed, and its structure and function are different from adults' skin.</p>

<h2><strong>The skin is made up of three distinct layers</strong></h2>

<h3>The first layer - the <strong>epidermis</strong></h3>

<p>This layer has a barrier function and gives the skin firmness and protection. The baby feels through it, it is thinner and more permeable than in adults. Baby skin absorbs more harmful substances than adult skin.</p>

<h3>The second layer - the <strong>dermis</strong></h3>

<p>The dermis contains sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair follicles and connective tissue. In babies, the function of the sweat and sebaceous glands is reduced. This makes it difficult for the baby to regulate body temperature changes. When there is no sweat and the body overheats, it cannot cool down through the baby's skin. The skin envelope (hydrolipid layer) consists of water and fine fats which repel microbes with their mild acidity. This is why it is important not to bathe newborn babies often.</p>

<h3>The deepest layer - the hypodermis</h3>

<p>The subcutaneous fatty layer, the hypodermis, is made up of fatty tissue that contains blood vessels and nerves. It stores energy (adipose tissue), provides protection and insulation. The blood vessels network is underdeveloped, as a result of which the baby is thermally unstable, i.e. adapts to temperature changes slowly. In two to three weeks, the baby gains weight, the skin layers thicken and the condition changes substantially. During the first few months, the skin grows stronger, thus becoming less sensitive to external factors. Sometimes, usually on the back, there are delicate thin hairs called lanugo, and on the face tiny white spots, smaller than the head of a pin (milia) can be seen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baby's skin can sometimes be dry, flaky, wrinkled, very red or marbled. Rash on the face and body or red spots can look dramatic, and the next day they disappear as if they had never even existed. All these changes are normal, they occur owing to skin immaturity, and as the baby thrives and gains weight, the skin develops, the subcutaneous layer increases, most of the changes recede spontaneously and do not require any treatment.</p>

3991,Stimulation of the function of the hand and motor development through daily activities,"""Often parents wonder which toys, games, activities are suitable for a child to learn and progress. Daily routines are an opportunity to direct attention, improve the function of the hand or learn to wait your turn: dressing, undressing, putting on shoes, feeding, combing, brushing teeth, vacuuming, dusting, sweeping, removing laundry from the machine, spreading laundry, using cutlery , chopping food .... ""","<h2>Daily routines</h2>

<p>From the 6th month, when the child starts to catch her feet, she enjoys taking off her socks. In the second year, this activity becomes part of understanding and executing orders: ""Take off your shoes, take off your socks, put on your shoes and socks."" Taking off shoes is an activity that precedes putting on shoes, but the child will show initiative to try, practice and in the end successfully perform the action. The same goes for taking off and putting on the lower and upper parts of the clothes.</p>

<p>If we want to include orientation in space and stimulation of motor activities, we give orders to a child to go to the room and bring pieces of clothing from the closet, we place pieces of clothing on beds, armchairs, where children can safely climb up and take them. Through this type of activity, in addition to stimulating the use of the hand, it also stimulates several areas of development:</p>

<ul>
	<li>social interaction</li>
	<li>communication and speech development</li>
	<li>improving motor skills</li>
	<li>improving hand function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Routines make both adults and children safe. We eat in the kitchen, bathe in the bathroom, dress in the room, keep our shoes in the hallway, sleep in the bedroom. All things stand in the same place, they take place according to a schedule that is known, in a way that is similar, without haste.</p>

<h1>Feeding</h1>

<p>Food is a nutritional need, but also a powerful sensory experience. Very often in our culture, food carries the message of love: ""Whoever cooks for me, whoever feeds me, loves me.""  Childhood scents, including of food prepared in our homes, are memories that we evoke when we want to feel comfortable. Smells connect memories. Food is colored differently in different periods of life, it has a different texture, taste, smell. Initially, the food is used for playing, kneading, mixing, spreading, throwing, and then it goes into the mouth for further processing. Family lunch is a place where children observe what others are doing and imitate them and always want food from their plates. Food can be eaten with fingers, a spoon, a fork, chopped with a knife. It is always eaten in one place that is provided by the organization in the house, without a TV, telephone or any other distraction, because food should be experienced with all the senses. </p>

<h2>Household chores</h2>

<p>Children like to participate in household chores. Through these activities we again expand communication, prolong active attention, improve hand function. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Dusting</li>

3996,Stimulation of motor activities in the third year,"<p>Healthy children are expected to start walking by the age of 20 months. The phase of learning to walk and independent walking is very intense and children have a constant need to further explore motor activities: running, climbing, kicking, throwing and catching a ball, walking up and down stairs, climbing uphill, going downhill, pushing push-toys, trying to ride a scooter, bicycle...</p>","<h2><strong>How a baby discovers the world when he/she starts walking</strong></h2>

<p>The world is big and interesting. Children explore it by climbing, going through or under things, running, pushing, turning, watching from all angles, and especially ""upside down"", because they love to put their head down, to be spun, turned, rocked by their parents... This period is characterized by the fact that they ask to do everything themselves, you often hear: ""Let me, let go!"". They are trying to let you know what they can do.</p>

<p>Changing the position of the head and body through these activities stimulates the brain and in this way children gain new experiences about their body; they can focus on a targeted activity (putting together puzzles, blocks, holding a pencil, stringing smaller beads, reading books...).</p>

<p><strong>Ball games:</strong> there is no better way to stimulate movement than using a ball: throwing, catching, kicking, tapping. First they perform all these activities with larger balls, using both hands, and then they start using smaller balls as well. Through activities with a ball, the child develops:</p>

<ul>
	<li>speed</li>
	<li>dexterity</li>
	<li>coordination</li>
	<li>measuring space</li>
	<li>planning movement</li>
	<li>correcting mistakes in play through countless repetitions</li>
	<li>activating the whole body through different patterns of movement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sand games: </strong>Digging, filling the bucket, carrying, pouring water, making a pile, turning to ""fix"" the sand towers. All these activities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>engage and strengthen the muscles of the whole body</li>
	<li>improve balance</li>
	<li>abound in sensory experiences provided by sand, pebbles, water.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Games in the park: </strong>swings, slides, climbers, trampolines... What better place than the park to gain new experiences about oneself and the world? Through games in the park, the child develops:</p>

<ul>
	<li>social interaction</li>
	<li>expanding vocabulary and learning to communicate with others</li>
	<li>motor skills</li>
	<li>orientation in space</li>
	<li>research</li>
	<li>imitation</li>
	<li>involving and organizing others in the game.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Kids love to move. Therefore, the focus should not be on making it easier for them to learn motor skills, but rather on enabling them to try, improve and learn in a safe environment, thus stimulating all areas of development: socio-emotional, cognitive, speech and language, motor, hand function development.</p>

4006,How to choose a baby skin care product,"<p>Gentle, soft, sensitive, fragrant... a baby's skin is a natural barrier, so it requires special hygiene and care.</p>","<p>The wide offer of different baby skin care products often confuses parents as to which one is the best for their baby.</p>

<p>No creams or lotions should be applied to healthy baby skin, except for the diaper region. With each additional application, you disrupt the skin's natural adaptation to the external environment.</p>

<p>Creams for the diaper region should be water-based (lat. emolliens - softening), without allergens, softening and conducive to moisture retention in the skin. Instead of baths and soaps, special products are recommended for bathing - syndets, hard soaps that do not irritate the baby's skin and do not remove the protective hydrolipid layer.</p>

<p>A syndet is a soap ""without soap"". It is a synthetic detergent and is much milder than soap. Its pH value is neutral, gentle, cleanses the skin just as well as soaps. Syndets can be solid (for washing the hands and face) or liquid (for washing the body); they also preserve the natural acidic skin envelope, which has a preventive effect on bacterial growth. They are gentle on the skin, do not close pores and do not irritate the skin.</p>

<p>You can also use baby micellar water for wiping; it gently cleanses babies' and children's sensitive skin, face, eyes, hands, skin folds and diaper regions. It softens the skin of newborns and children. It has good dermatological and ophthalmological tolerability. It is free of parabens, phthalates and phenoxyethanol, soap and dyes. It is applied to the skin with a cotton pad, no rinsing is required. All micellar water ingredients are over 98% of natural origin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baby bath products should not be used more than 2-3 times a week, in accordance with the ""as briefly and as little as possible"" principle.</p>

4066,Choice of baby diapers,<p>Baby skin is more sensitive than adult skin. It requires frequent diaper changes and appropriate diaper size.</p>,"<p>The right diaper size is the one that suits the baby's age and weight. The area covered by the diaper should always be washed with water and soap after passing stool. Disposable diapers are the most convenient. They are put on by spreading the diaper and placing it under the baby's bottom, so that the adhesive strips are to the left and right of the waist. Lift the front part of the diaper between the baby's legs, fold it over the genital area, pull out the elastic ruffle around the legs with your fingers, and then fasten the strips on the front part of the diaper. Always check that a finger can be slipped in between the abdomen and the diaper.</p>

<p>Cotton diapers are considered to be healthier and more comfortable to wear; they are less likely to cause diaper rash if they are changed regularly. They are made of 100% natural material that allows the skin to breathe freely. Leak-proof diaper covers are always used with them. Disposable diapers are changed every two to three hours.</p>

<p>There are also bamboo diapers on our market, which are made of bamboo fiber and are resistant to fungi and bacteria. They are suitable for children prone to allergies. They are washed in a washing machine, not ironed, air-dried. When discarded, they decompose in 6 , compared to 100-500 years for disposable diapers.</p>

<p>Diaper rash occurs due to incomplete hygiene during changing, leaving wet diapers on for too long, excessive and improper use of wet wipes, allergies to certain types of food, use of antibiotic therapy. In the case of cotton diapers, the reaction occurs due to insufficiently rinsed detergent and fabric softener, as well as leaving wet diapers on for too long. Diaper rash can be prevented by frequent diaper changes. If a rash occurs in a baby younger than 40 days, if pus and scabs are present along with the rash, if a fever occurs, and the condition does not improve even after 2-3 days, it is necessary to contact a pediatrician.</p>",9381,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50",59,60,326,"6866, 231, 3981",0,0,"<ol>

<ul>
	<li>For regular cleaning of the oral cavity of newborns and infants, you need a sterile compress 5x5 cm and saline.</li>
	<li>Wash your hands, then wrap gauze around your index finger and pour saline solution on gauze; then lightly rest your finger on the baby's lips, the baby will start sucking your finger as a reflex; then, with light pressure and circular motions, clean the inside of both cheeks and lower the finger over the tongue. Hold the rolled gauze with your thumb. Wiping also has a gum massage function that is soothing to the baby, especially when his/her teeth are erupting.</li>
	<li>A common change that occurs in the mucous membranes of babies' mouth and tongue in the form of whitish deposits (looks like clotted milk) is called thrush or oral candidiasis. It may cause babies to eat less, and even refuse food.</li>
	<li>At home, this condition is treated with a mild solution of baking soda (a level teaspoonful of baking soda per 100 ml of boiled and cooled water). Wash your hands, wrap sterile gauze around your finger, then moisten it with the baking soda solution, and then carefully run your finger over the deposits in one circular motion around the baby's entire oral cavity, without strong pressure. When the infection has progressed, the deposits are harder to remove and the procedure should be repeated.</li>
	<li>Take care that the baby does not swallow the solution because he/she may vomit. It is best to perform the procedure an hour before or after feeding. If the deposits do not disappear in two to three days, consult a doctor.</li>

After bathing, washing and thoroughly rinsing the hair, the baby's head should be rubbed well with a dry towel. Comb the baby's hair in all directions with a brush, as this massages the hairy part of the head, speeds up circulation, improves hair nutrition and the activity of the sebaceous glands.</p>

4096,Teething - how to help a child,"<p>For parents, the appearance of the first tooth is often a cause for celebration, but it can also be a source of stress and sleepless nights. Some babies' teeth grow without any difficulties, while others get their first tooth with a lot of tears and discomfort.</p>","<p>Tooth growth usually begins between 3rd and 6th month. Some babies are born with a tooth, some only get their first tooth when they start walking.</p>

<p>Teething problems include: increased salivation, putting the hands in the mouth, refusing solid food, swollen, red and sore gums, irritability, anxiety, waking up during the night, the occurrence of somewhat liquid stools (no diarrhea) and sometimes a slight fever (not exceeding 38 degrees).</p>

<h2>How to help the child:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>By cooling the gums - use teethers that can be cooled in the refrigerator, do not keep them in the freezer because the baby can be injured by a frozen teether. Teethers are usually made of rubber or special plastic, in different baby-friendly shapes and designs. Always use certified teethers from verified manufacturers.</li>
	<li>Gum massage - wash your hands thoroughly and massage your baby's gums with your index finger. Different gels or liquids for applying on and massaging babies' gums are available on the market. These gels contain medicinal herbs, hyaluronic acid or a local anesthetic. Use them according to the manufacturer's instructions, according to the child's age.</li>
</ul>

<p>Increased salivation may cause irritation or a rash around the lips, which can be conducive to an infection. To avoid this, wash your baby's face regularly, dry the area around the lips, apply a neutral protective cream. Put a cotton diaper under his/her head during sleep and change it often to keep the baby's face and cheeks dry at all times.</p>

4101,The order of eruption of deciduous teeth,"<p>The growth of deciduous teeth usually begins between 3rd and 6h month. By the end of the third year, the child has 20 deciduous teeth, and around the age of six, the deciduous teeth are replaced with permanent ones.</p>","<p>The first tooth is usually the lower central incisor - called ""one"".</p>

<p>After the eruption of lower central incisors (6-10 months), upper central incisors erupt (8-12 months), followed by upper lateral incisors or ""twos"" (9-13 months), lower lateral incisors (10-16 months), upper first premolars or ""fours"" (13-19 months), lower first premolars (14-18 months), and then the so-called ""threes"" or ""canines"", first in the upper (16-22 months), and then in the lower jaw (17-23 months).</p>

<p>Canines usually cause more discomfort to children, they erupt with more tears and pain.</p>

<p>After canines, the lower second premolars or ""fives"" grow (23-31 months), followed by upper second pre<a>molars</a> (25-33 months).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Deciduous teeth not only serve as ""placeholders"" for permanent teeth, but are also very important for the baby's proper development. They cut food, grind it and prepare it for digestion, thus enabling the full utilization of all nutrients from food. Deciduous teeth affect children's speech development, the articulation of individual sounds and words.</p>

<p>Proper development of teeth and jaws is also important for aesthetic appearance later in life.</p>

<p>A beautiful smile and correct speech significantly affect your child's health and self-confidence!</p>

4106,Teeth brushing - play and fun,"<p>""Proper brushing technique and getting into the habit of brushing the teeth regularly and properly ensure your child's health and self-confidence.""</p>","<p>It is necessary to start brushing your baby's teeth immediately after the first teeth erupt. In the beginning, you can clean them only with gauze and saline solution, and when the first incisors are fully grown, brush them with a small brush that you put on your finger like a thimble. Clean your baby's teeth at least twice a day without toothpaste (optimally after each meal).</p>

<p>After the first year, start using a small amount of mild baby fluoride paste. It is not harmful even if the child swallows it. The toothbrush should be appropriate to the child's age (soft and small, bristles of equal length, cheerful colors, can also play music).</p>

<p>The more interesting the brush, the more successful the brushing, with a song, play, joking, splashing water and a lot of patience. In fact, it is you who brushes the child's teeth, while the child plays and learns. It is only around the age of three that the child masters this skill, although even then he/she brushes his/her teeth with your help.</p>

<p>The teeth are brushed, one by one, from the gums to the chewing surface, first the tongue-side part of the tooth, then the cheek-side part, then the chewing surface. The brush is held at a slight <a>angle</a>. Teach the child to take water, rinse his/her teeth and spit out the liquid. Don't forget that the tongue must be cleaned as well.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Plan your first visit to the dentist around the sixth month, and by the first birthday at the latest. Then you will receive instructions from the dentist on the proper maintenance of dental hygiene.</p>

<p>The child will get to know his/her dentist and practice through play and fun. Through regular visits without painful interventions, the child will learn that going to the ""Dentist"" is not a reason for fear and tears. Thus, if a tooth happens to decay, the child will not refuse to go to the dentist. You will have the tooth fixed easily, without pain and on time.</p>

<p>Oral and dental hygiene is very important for the first deciduous teeth, because it is only with hygiene that we can keep them healthy until they fall out and permanent teeth erupt.</p>

4111,How to keep toys clean,"<p>Baby toys easily find their way from the floor to their mouths. By putting toys in the mouth, babies get acquainted with the objects around them, have fun, play, calm down, but they can also ingest microorganisms that cause various diseases.</p>","<p>To keep your baby healthy, toys should be washed regularly as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Boil rattles and teethers at the end of each day in a pot with a little liquid dishwashing detergent. Rinse well under running water and pat dry.</li>
	<li>Rinse ducks, fish, boats and other toys that babies play with while bathing, squeeze all the water out of them (if water has got inside), dry them to prevent fungi, mold and <a>bacteria</a> from developing on them.</li>
	<li>Wash plastic and wooden props (blocks, cars, trucks) with a mild baby detergent or dishwashing liquid, then rinse well and <a>dry</a>.</li>
	<li>Cloth and stuffed toys collect most dust and mites. Shake them out and wash them in the washing machine regularly, every 15 days. Wash them with a mild liquid laundry detergent. Always rinse twice.</li>
	<li>Pay special attention to the toys that the child plays with outside, in the yard. After playing, wash them under warm running water with liquid detergent. Make sure that no soil or sand remains on them. Rinse and dry.</li>
</ul>

<p>When buying toys, keep the following in mind: </p>

<ul>
	<li>their hygiene should be easy to maintain,</li>
	<li>they should be of good quality, from verified manufacturers (with a certificate),</li>
	<li>they should be safe and</li>
	<li>they should be age-appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Designate a plastic box or basket for storing children's <a>toys</a>. Teach your child from the earliest age to pick up his/her toys after playing and put them away. In this way, good habits are acquired through play and neatness is developed in the <a>child</a>.</p>

4116,When it's time for the first pillow,"<p>It is known that babies do not use pillows; it is enough to put a cloth diaper or an empty pillow case under the baby's head. Many babies gag, so the role of this improvised pillow is actually just to protect the baby's bedding (sheets).</p>","<h2><strong>The first pillow </strong></h2>

<p>The first pillow can be used around the age of one. Here are some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The pillow should be thin, to avoid an incorrect position of the spine.</li>
	<li>The area of the pillow should be large enough to avoid the child's head slipping off the pillow when turning.</li>
	<li>The pillow serves to fill the space between the shoulders and the head when the child sleeps on his/her side or to fill the space between the cervical spine, nape and back.</li>
	<li>Pillows of medium thickness, from 10 to 15 centimeters, are recommended. Standards vary depending on the country; the standard in our country is pillow size of 50 × 80 centimeters.</li>
	<li>In the period from the second to the fifth year, children grow and develop intensively; a slightly thicker pillow can then be used.</li>
	<li>Children do not need anatomical pillows.</li>
	<li>It is recommended to use pillows made of modern anti-allergy materials, to wash them occasionally and change them every year.</li>
	<li>If the child does not want to use a pillow, finds it uncomfortable, removes it from under his/her head, there is no need to insist on using it.</li>

4121,How to choose a stroller for a baby,"<p>When choosing a stroller, parents are often faced with a dilemma; in addition to the aesthetic criteria, the stroller should be light and practical.</p>","<p>Choose a stroller according to the environment (whether you live in an apartment building or a house, whether you have an elevator), lifestyle (conditions in which you plan to use them - pavement, grass, cobblestones, sand), living conditions (small elevator in the building, you live on 4th floor, one-bedroom apartment and you have nowhere to put it). The season in which you are buying the stroller; whether you plan to use that same stroller or plan to buy an umbrella stroller when the baby starts to sit (they are only used in the summer). The weight of the stroller is important; it usually ranges from 6 to 20 kilograms for twin strollers.</p>

<p>It is also necessary to take into account:</p>

<ul>
	<li>wheels (plastic or rubber, size)</li>
	<li>folding/unfolding system</li>
	<li>size (do they fit in your trunk, storage room)</li>
	<li>do they have additional accessories (bag, footmuff - protection from cold, protection from rain, sunshade, mosquito net, cup holder, basket - shopping bag)</li>
	<li>material of which they are made (quality and safety, maintenance method)</li>
	<li>backrest adjustability</li>
</ul>

<p>Up to the age of 6 months, the baby must face the parents, to allow them to observe the baby and make eye contact, thus giving the baby an additional sense of security and protection<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Strollers must not have openings where babies can get their fingers stuck; they should be strong and stable. The roof protects the child from the sun, rain and wind, but it is good to have a window through which you can see the child.</p>

<p>In cold weather, beside stroller accessories, you must always cover the baby with an additional layer, because he/she does not move and feels much colder than the parents, who move and push the stroller.</p>

<p>Color, design, fashion details are the parents' choice, but they must not be the primary consideration in choosing a stroller. Trio systems that include a stroller and a car seat are cost-effective because the set often cost less than separate purchases. Always try the stroller in the store several times, to have a clearer idea when making a choice.</p>

<p>Incorrect position, inadequate size and the way of using the stroller negatively affect the baby's psychomotor development.</p>",9391,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"341, 54","4126, 4131, 4136",0,0,"<ol>

	<li>Adjust the time of going out to the baby's rhythm, do not take the child out if he/she is nervous or hungry.</li>

4136,A winter walk with a baby,"<p>Walks in cold weather are very useful for building and strengthening immunity; however, when it comes to babies, it is necessary to be careful.</p>","<p>Do not take the baby out until he/she is one month old, then take him/her out for a short time around noon. If the baby is cold, he/she will cry, his/her hands will be ice-cold, and he/she may shiver. Don’t let that happen! If you notice these signs, you should take the child home immediately, warm him/her, breastfeed or give him/her a warm drink. Do not neglect the effect of cold wind! Strong wind makes the body lose heat faster, even when the thermometer does not show extremely low temperatures.</p>

<h2><strong>Important considerations for winter walks with the baby:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The stroller should have a cold-weather cover and a warm surface for the baby to lie on (a blanket will do).</li>
	<li>The child should be dressed in layered cold-weather clothes. Take care to avoid overheating or sweating.</li>
	<li>If the temperature is around zero, the baby's ears must be covered with a winter hat, hands with mittens, and the neck with a scarf.</li>
	<li>When the wind blows, the baby's face can be wrapped in a scarf, but the nose must not be blocked.</li>
	<li>Hats and cold-weather clothes should be made of tight-woven fiber (e.g. wool). Wool and similar materials provide good thermal insulation.</li>
	<li>Avoid cotton clothes because they absorb water and stay wet.</li>
	<li>The feet should be protected from the cold with a snowsuit or warm shoes even if the baby does not walk; cover the baby with a blanket in the stroller.</li>
	<li>Keep in mind that the baby is wearing a snowsuit with a slippery surface, and you - a winter jacket, so handling the baby will be more difficult if he/she cries or you need to take him/her out of the stroller.</li>

	<li>Put UV protection sunglasses on his/her eyes, put an umbrella on the stroller.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Infants older than 6 months </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Apply a sunscreen with the highest sun protection factor. Apply the sunscreen 20 minutes before going for a walk and reapply every two hours. Don't forget to cover the child's lips, ears and the back of the neck with sunscreen.</li>
	<li>When choosing protection products, you should always choose those that are intended for children.</li>
	<li>The sunscreen should not be used if more than one year has passed since opening.</li>
	<li>When buying a sunscreen, make sure it does not contain PABA, as many babies are sensitive to this ingredient .</li>
	<li>When using a new sunscreen, you must test it first: apply it on a small area of the child's skin in the forearm area and check if there is a rash, redness or itching in the next 24 hours. If there are no changes on the skin, the child may use the sunscreen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your child is taking a medicine, read the usage instructions or ask the pediatrician if the child can go out in the sun, because some medicines can cause skin reactions such as rashes.</p>

4146,Protect your child from mosquitoes,"<p>Walking and playing in the nature are very useful for the child's development. Mosquitoes can spoil the fun. Mosquito bites are generally not dangerous, but cause a lot of discomfort (redness, swelling, blisters, itching).</p>","<h2><strong>The most important thing is to protect your child from mosquito bites.</strong></h2>

<p>When your children are outdoors, dress them in clothes of lighter shades, long pants, socks on their feet, long-sleeved T-shirts.</p>

<p>Install mosquito nets on windows and doors, baby crib and <a>stroller</a>.</p>

<p>There are various preparations (repellents) on the market that protect against mosquito bites. When choosing one, always follow the age indicated on the product itself (not all products are intended for children under 2 years of age), expiration date, instructions for use (do not apply to all body parts, avoid applying the product to damaged and irritated skin, apply sparingly).</p>

<p>Repellents come in the form of sprays, roll-ons, gels, wet wipes, and in various sizes; they are practical for travel and it is good to always have them on hand. It is best to buy tested and registered preparations.</p>

<p>You can also use mosquito repellent devices. Some are plugged in a socket, while others are portable (battery operated) and can be attached to a baby stroller, clothes, <a>bag</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid staying in the nature without the recommended protection, in the period when mosquitoes are most active, in the evening, by rivers, lakes, unmaintained grassy and wooded areas.</p>

<p>After a bite, it is best to apply a cold compress for a few minutes (a handkerchief, gauze or towel soaked in cold water, or a refrigerated bottle of water), and then apply a preparation that has soothing properties and relieves <a>itching</a>.</p>

4151,First time on a beach,"<p>The first time you are on a beach or by a pool with the baby, he/she may be scared of noise, crowd, waves, and will refuse to go into the water with you. It is desirable to get the baby wet gradually and adapt to the water. Do not do anything by force.</p>","<p>It is best to start by bathing the baby in a small pool by the water (never leave the baby unattended by the parents, regardless of the fact that the water in the pool is shallow). Hold the baby with one hand while in the pool, and lightly splash him/her with water from the pool with the other hand. If you go into the water with the baby, do not let the child out of your arm and splash him/her lightly with the other hand; when the child gets used to the water and its temperature a little, and you can see that it suits him/her, put him/her in a float (swim ring).</p>

<p>For babies and young children, there are floats with leg holes; they are the safest in them. When you are in the water with your baby, always stand firmly on your feet, do not go into deep water. It is not advisable for a 6-month-old baby to stay in the water for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Since babies still can't control their bladder or bowel movement, use disposable swimming diapers.</p>

<p>It is also important to rinse the baby's skin with running water every time he/she comes out of the sea, pool or lake and wiped with a towel. Change the baby into dry clothes; there are special UV-protective clothes on the market. If the child walks, be sure to put shoes on his/her feet.</p>

<p>Apply sunscreen even if the child is playing under a beach umbrella (sun shade), because the sun's rays are reflected from concrete, water and sand. Don't forget the part behind the ears, the back of the neck, back and shoulders, as well as the hands and feet, the back of the arms and the area around the bathing suit edges. Although children's sunscreens are waterproof, we recommend reapplying every two hours.</p>",11396,2,"47,48,49",59,60,"356, 4711",4141,0,0,"<ol>

4156,Baby travel accessories,"<p>Before packing, make a list of things to take on the trip. In order for your child to be safe, you should transport him/her in a certified and correctly installed car seat, appropriate for the child's age, and buckle the child properly every time.</p>","<p>If you travel by car in the summer, it is best to travel early in the morning, late afternoon or at night; you should avoid the hottest part of the day.</p>

<p>When preparing to go on a trip with your baby, it is necessary to prepare and install sun visors<strong>.</strong>  Depending on the season you travel in, the baby must be dressed in layers and have every possible protection when he/she gets out of the car. Be sure to bring a bag with spare clothes, a blanket, disposable diapers, diaper cream, wet wipes, a few bags for disposing of dirty items and garbage. Keep a travel medical kit at your fingertips.</p>

<p>If the child is two years old and uses a pillow, be sure to bring it.</p>

<p>If the child eats solid food, be sure to pack it in a portable refrigerator, use a thermos for liquids, bring enough water.</p>

<p>It is often necessary to entertain the child while driving so as not to disturb the driver. Avoid giving hard toys to a child in the vehicle, as they can injure the child when braking. Prepare music, picture books, some games or cartoons. You can talk to slightly older children about what they see outside. Take frequent breaks to rest and take a short walk with your child.</p>

It is best to travel early in the morning or late in the afternoon, if you are traveling in the summer. If you are going on a long trip, air conditioning in the car is a necessity (visit the service beforehand). Install sun visors on the car windows.</p>

4171,Necessary washing of baby strollers,"<p>When buying a stroller, it is necessary to pay attention to the method of maintenance and cleaning. Check the warranty card for instructions on how to disassemble, assemble, maintain and wash all parts of the stroller.</p>","<p>In most strollers, the method of maintenance, washing, removal of all textile parts, covers and cushions is indicated and marked, and they also have symbols indicating whether washing in a washing machine is allowed and at what temperature. The more folding and removable parts on the stroller, the easier it is to wash and maintain.</p>

<p>Start by disassembling the stroller into the smallest possible parts, then vacuum all the folds where food crumbs and other impurities may have remained. Wash the stroller with a sponge and warm water in which you have added a small amount of mild baby detergent. If there are stubborn stains or spots, treat them with baby-friendly products tested for use on baby items.</p>

<p>Use neutral detergents and rinse them thoroughly, and then dry each part with a dry cloth. Pay special attention to wheel mechanisms, which should be brushed well to remove dust, stones and other small items stuck in the wheels. Wash the wheels with warm water and a sponge.</p>

<p>If it is not possible to disassemble the stroller, you can wash it under running water in the bathtub or in the yard . Always rinse several times, because sometimes white circles from a larger amount of detergent can remain if the fabric is not rinsed thoroughly. The use of stiff brushes, wires and similar items can damage the material. Metal parts are washed under running water and are the easiest to maintain. Since strollers are stored indoors: in hallways, basements, garages where they can absorb moisture, smoke and other impurities, it is recommended to protect them with special covers before disposal.</p>

4176,Breast care before and after breastfeeding,"<p>The baby loves mom's natural scent most; it helps him/her find the nipple, latch on more easily and suckle more actively. During the lactation period, it is not recommended to use baths and body foams with an intense scent, especially in the breast area.</p>","<p>Breast hygiene is maintained in the same way as whole body hygiene, by showering once a day with a neutral soap. Breasts, especially nipples, should not be washed before breastfeeding. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap before breastfeeding, squeeze a few drops of milk from the breasts and spread it on the nipples and areolas so that the baby can smell and taste the milk.</p>

<p>If problems occur before breastfeeding, if the breasts are heavy, swollen, engorged and full of milk, a combination of warm compresses and breast massage before breastfeeding and pumping is recommended, in order to make it easier for the baby to latch on the breast. If the breasts remain full even after breastfeeding, it is necessary to express milk. After breastfeeding, squeeze a few drops of milk and spread it on the nipples and areolas again, and leave them to air dry. Apply cold compresses after breastfeeding/expressing (about 15 minutes), the compress will reduce pain and milk flow. If the nipple skin is damaged during breastfeeding, if the damaged area bleeds, spare that breast from breastfeeding for 1-2 days. During this time, empty the breast regularly by hand expression every 2-3 hours. Give baby milk with a teaspoon, cup or syringe. You can also apply hypoallergenic modified lanolin on the nipples. Silicone nipple shields and shells can sometimes help.</p>

In order to prevent them, the most important thing is to identify the possibilities for their occurrence in time and then secure the environment in which the child spends time.</p>","<h2> <strong>Make your home safe  </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Remove or secure pieces of furniture that can be easily knocked down or overturned.</li>
	<li>Remove slippery floor mats and rugs.</li>
	<li>At the bottom and top of the stairs, install a gate with a latch that a young child cannot open.</li>
	<li>Install handrails or handles on the stairs for the child to hold on to.</li>
	<li>The staircase should be unobstructed.</li>
	<li>Install security stoppers/locks on the windows and terrace/balcony doors to limit their opening, or secure them with bars.</li>
	<li>Furniture that a child can climb on (beds, chairs, etc.) should never be placed under or next to a window.</li>
	<li>Keep the balcony door locked - an unsupervised child should not be on the balcony.</li>
	<li>Remove the ladder out of the reach of children immediately after use.</li>
	<li>Put non-slip mats on the tiles in the bathroom and in the bath/shower.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Special caution</strong><strong>: infants and young children</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Never leave a child unattended on the changing table!</li>
	<li>If you use a cradle, make sure that its stand is stable enough.</li>
	<li>The crib must have adequate depth and a fence. The crib depth should be at least 60 cm (from the upper edge of the mattress to the top of the fence) to prevent the child from falling out.</li>
	<li>There must be no rungs on the sides of the crib that a small child could climb on.</li>
	<li>When using a feeding chair and a stroller, make sure that the child is always strapped in.</li>
	<li>Avoid using a walker!</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Enable children to play safely</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Check whether the equipment on the playground is in working order - whether the swing is well attached, whether there are nails protruding from the seesaw, etc.</li>
	<li>Remove from the playground everything that a child can stumble on - stones, sticks, etc.</li>
	<li>Make sure your children use play equipment according to their age and abilities.</li>
	<li>If possible, choose a playground with a softer surface.</li>
	<li>During sports and recreational activities, the child should wear appropriate protective equipment (if riding a bicycle, he/she should wear a helmet, and with rollerblades, appropriate arm and leg protection).</li>

4191,How to prevent a child from drowning,"<p>Drowning is the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age, and one of the most common causes of death for children of all other ages. Caregivers' caution is a crucial factor in preventing drowning.</p>","<h2><strong>How to prevent a child from drowning</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Always be careful when children are near water. Supervise children's behavior carefully at all times.</li>
	<li>Never instruct older children to look after younger children while bathing, swimming or playing near water. Wherever children bathe or swim (in the sea, lake, pool, bathtub), supervision by parents or other adults responsible for the children is always necessary.</li>
	<li>When you bathe children in the bathtub, be with them. Babies and young children usually drown in a bath or tub. Be present all the time while bathing the child and do not leave the children even with older siblings. As soon as you finish bathing the child, empty the bath. Babies can drown in water only a few inches deep!</li>
	<li>Identify the possible hazards in your yard. Wells, toilets, barrels, buckets, troughs - young children can fall into them easily, so it is necessary not to keep them filled with water or accessible to children. Enclose swimming pools and other water surfaces with a protective fence, to prevent children from approaching them without supervision.</li>
	<li>Secure your yard so that children cannot leave it on their own. Children can go out to the street or adjacent yards and encounter unsecured canals, swimming pools and other bodies of water.</li>
	<li>Children should wear protective gear if they cannot swim, such as swim vests, armbands, etc. The likelihood of drowning increases if this type of personal protective gear is not used; therefore, make sure that children wear protection, especially when moving along the shore, sailing in boats or swimming in rivers, lakes, the sea, and, if necessary, in swimming pools.</li>
	<li>Jumps into the water are a special danger. Jumping into shallow water and hitting against the pool edge during the jump are a common cause of spinal cord injuries, and can also lead to drowning. Teach children to check the depth of the water they want to jump into, as well as to make sure they jump feet-first the first time.</li>
	<li>During the winter, do not allow children to walk on frozen water surfaces. The ice cover is often not strong enough to support a child's weight.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Teach the child to swim</strong></h2>

<p>At the age of 4-5, children should start swimming training, but keep in mind that every child is different, and you should not force him/her; instead, he/she should start swimming lessons when he/she is ready, so as not to create resistance to swimming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember - just because a child knows how to swim doesn't mean you should leave him/her unattended. Master the skill of swimming and basic resuscitation procedures (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).</p>

4201,"How to prevent children's suffocation, choking, strangulation","<p>Choking due to swallowing a foreign object most often occurs between the first and fifth year of life. Intensive exploration of the environment, when children can put a smaller object (toy parts, buttons, etc.) in their mouths, or carelessness when eating, solid food (nuts) or insufficiently chopped soft food (grapes, hot dogs, sausages, etc.) are common causes of suffocation.</p>","<h2> <strong>Protect your child from suffocation:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Always keep children under supervision while eating or playing.</li>
	<li>Do not give children under the age of four any food that could lead to suffocation. Small and hard pieces of food, such as nuts, popcorn and candy, are especially dangerous.</li>
	<li>Children should be taught to eat at the table and not be allowed to run or play while eating.</li>
	<li>Balls and other toys for young children should be larger than a table tennis ball.</li>
	<li>Do not allow young children to play with small toys or their parts, as they can cause suffocation.</li>
	<li>Teach older children to keep toys that contain small parts out of the reach of younger siblings.</li>
	<li>Keep all plastic wraps or bags out of the reach of children, and especially away from where they sleep.</li>
	<li>Throw any broken toys in the trash and make sure there are no small objects such as buttons, beads, coins, pins or pebbles on the floor or low surfaces. </li>
	<li>Remove drawstrings from the hoods or necks of all children's clothing.</li>
	<li>Teach children to take off their bicycle helmets or decorative necklaces from the neck before using the equipment on children's playgrounds.</li>
	<li>Do not keep soft objects and plush toys in the crib or cot, especially those with ribbons or small parts, as well as stuffed toys.</li>
	<li>Put the child to sleep on his/her back and to play on his/her tummy.</li>
	<li>Shorten the pull cords on blinds and curtains so that they are out of the reach of young children and keep the crib away from window curtains. Do not use canopies, curtains or hanging decorations for cribs and put the child to sleep on his/her back.  </li>

4206,A child is suffocating - what to do?,"<p>Symptoms depend on the nature of the foreign object and the place where it is stuck in the airway. When a foreign object enters the airways, a dramatic scene can happen: breathing suddenly becomes difficult, the child is suffocating, coughing, blushing. As long as the child is coughing and breathing, he/she is not in immediate danger of death. However, if the cough becomes weaker, breathing is difficult, with wheezing, the face turns blue, and the child loses consciousness, then the foreign object has completely blocked the airway.</p>","<h2>Encourage your child to cough first!</h2>

<p>Spontaneous cough is the best way to remove foreign objects from the upper respiratory tract. If the child is not able to cough, if he/she is not breathing, immediately remove the foreign object from the child's airway and start resuscitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ATTENTION! A foreign object can only be pulled out with your fingers if it is accessible and visible!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two techniques are used to expel a foreign object: a) slaps on the back or pressure on the chest, and b) the Heimlich maneuver.</p>

<h2><strong>Slaps on the back and pressure on the chest</strong></h2>

<p>These can be performed in several ways, depending on the child's age:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Hold the infant</strong> on your forearm, turned ""upside down"" and facing the floor. Hold his/her head with the hand of the arm on which the baby is supported. With the other arm, with the heel of the hand, slap the infant with moderate force 5 times in the area between the shoulder blades.</li>
	<li>Then turn the child on his/her back and support him/her with your forearm. Hold the child's head with the hand of that arm and keep the head slightly lower than the body. Similarly to heart massage, press on the sternum 5 times in a row, but harder and slower than during heart massage (one pressure should last 3 seconds). If a foreign object becomes visible after these procedures, remove it.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>For a young child,</strong> perform this procedure sitting on a chair: </h2>

<p>Put the child on your knees, facing the floor, and keep his/her head lower than other body parts. With the heel of your hand, hit him/her hard 5 times in the area between the shoulder blades. </p>

<h2><strong>For an older child,</strong> perform the procedure in a standing position:</h2>

<p>Tell the child to cough with all his/her might. Bend him/her forward and hit between the shoulder blades 5 times with the heel of your hand. If this does not help or more severe symptoms occur, put both your arms around his/her chest, place your hands on the lower part of the sternum and press on the sternum up to 5 times.</p>

<h2><strong>The classic Heimlich maneuver is performed on children older than one year:</strong> </h2>

<p>Techniques for performing this procedure differ depending on the child's position.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>If the child is standing or sitting,</strong> approach him/her from behind and put both your arms around the child's chest, under the armpits. Place one hand, clenched in a fist, in the middle of the abdomen, just above the navel, and put the other hand around the clenched fist. Then press upwards 5 times in a row, taking care not to press the tip of the sternum and the lower edge of the ribs. Take the position that suits you best - you can lift the child, kneel behind him/her or put the child on a chair.</li>
	<li><strong>If the child is lying (unconscious),</strong> the Heimlich procedure is performed as follows: the child is put to lie on his/her back, and the head is straightened, so that the face is turned upwards. Straddle the child's legs, put the heel of one hand in the middle of his/her abdomen (above the navel, below the tip of the sternum), place the other hand over the first and press upwards 5 times in a row. If the foreign object becomes visible after these procedures, remove it and continue with artificial respiration. If artificial respiration does not lead to the chest rising, repeat the same procedure to expel the foreign object or use another procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case of a severe obstruction, where you are not able to expel the foreign object by slaps on the back or the Heimlich procedure, start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately, without delay! Apply 5 test breaths, and if the passage of air is still blocked, continue with CPR only by pressing on the chest. Call the emergency medical service a minute or two after the resuscitation begins!</p>

<blockquote>
<h2><strong>What not to do</strong></h2>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not try to remove an object from the child's mouth if the object cannot be seen! There is a serious risk of pushing the object even deeper into the trachea and thus aggravating the child's condition.</p>

4216,How to prevent child poisoning?,<p>Numerous agents used in the household daily contain highly toxic ingredients. Prevention of possible child poisoning is based on a responsible approach towards the use and disposal of sources of potentially toxic substances.</p>,"<h2><strong>Identify poison sources in the household</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Products hazardous for children include: cleaning and machine washing agents, cosmetic preparations, medicines, alcohol, opiates, antifreeze, gasoline, paints, varnishes, rodent poisons, plant protection products, some types of plants and fungi. An additional hazard is posed by toxic fumes and gases occurring due to fire, combustion of solid and liquid fuels, leakage of faulty gas installations, or car exhaust fumes, if the engine is started in a closed garage.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Keep chemical agents and medicines locked and out of reach of children</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>After use, do not leave chemical agents and medicines on the table, floor or shelves, but put them in a secure place.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Never leave medicines and chemical agents in food containers or packaging, or transfer them into beverage bottles </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Store them in their original packaging, in order to quickly determine the chemical composition if needed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>After use, always close tightly the caps and lids on the packaging of chemical agents or medicines.</li>
	<li>Ventilate the rooms where chemical agents are used. Also, do not make mixtures of different chemical agents, as certain ingredients react chemically to each other, which can produce and release toxic gases.</li>
	<li>When using  medicines, read the instructions for use and follow the doctor's or pharmacist's advice.</li>
	<li>Also, be aware of the medicines and chemical agents brought to your home by guests, and recommend precautions.</li>
	<li>Dispose of unneeded or expired medicines in the prescribed and safe way.</li>
	<li>Do not call medicines tempting names (candy, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Some plants </strong><strong>may be poisonous - check if there are such plants in your home or garden</strong> </h2>

<p>Do not allow children to pick or eat any plants without permission. Be sure to warn children about the danger of poisonous mushrooms!</p>

<h2>Be especially careful if you are a user of electronic cigarettes, keep them out of reach of children</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Liquid nicotine from their charges can be very dangerous for children.</li>
	<li>If the child is staying outside your home (with relatives, friends, on a trip), explain to those who care for the child how to prevent the possibility of poisoning.</li>
	<li>Button batteries (small, circular batteries for wristwatches, toys, etc.) are also dangerous. These batteries can severely harm children's health if they are swallowed or stuck in the nose, ear or throat.</li>
	<li>Do not start motor vehicles in a closed garage. Prevent exhaust fumes from accumulating indoors.</li>

4231,Burns in children and how to prevent them - general measures,"<p>Thinking about the safety aspects of heat sources, electrical devices and installations is an important prerequisite for preventing burns and other serious injuries.</p>","<h2><strong>Make your home safe</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Power sockets should have appropriate safety covers to prevent children from sticking their fingers or various objects into them (they are available in electrical supplies stores).</li>
	<li>Place special protective shields on open heat sources (electrical heaters, fireplace, etc.).</li>
	<li>Remove and lock all chemicals (cleaning agents, etc.) out of the reach of children - in addition to being toxic, they can cause severe burns to the skin and eyes.</li>
	<li>Matches, lighters and other items for lighting fires must be kept out of the reach of children.</li>

	<li>Install and maintain smoke detectors - on each floor and in all bedrooms. Test them once a month to make sure they are in working order. If possible, use long-lasting batteries.</li>
	<li>Regularly check whether electrical installations and heating devices in your home are in working order.</li>
	<li>Insulate each wire.</li>
	<li>Before leaving the home, make sure that you have switched off the stove/iron/other electrical appliances.</li>
	<li>Keep curtains and other flammable objects away from heat sources.</li>
	<li>Keep a fire extinguisher in working order in the house/apartment.</li>

<p>When cooking, always be near the stove/oven and never leave the food that is being cooked unattended! The handles of saucepans, pots, frying pans, coffee pots should always be turned towards the wall when they are on the stove, to make them inaccessible to the child. What else can you do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monitor and limit the use of the stove, microwave and other heating devices by older children. </li>
	<li>Whenever possible, cook food on the hotplate that is further away.</li>
	<li>Young children and babies should not be near the stove or in the kitchen!</li>

	<li>Never leave hot food and liquids unattended near children!</li>
	<li>Never put hot food on a table with a tablecloth that the child can pull!</li>
	<li>Do not leave a young child unattended in a room where there is an open heat source (e.g. an iron turned on) or in which something is cooking! </li>
	<li>Teach older children how to properly handle heating devices and limit their use.</li>

<h2><strong>Special caution when bathing:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Check the water temperature before bathing children!</li>
	<li>Limit the maximum water temperature in your water heater — set the thermostat to max. 60<sup>o</sup>C.</li>

4241,A child got burned - what to do?,"<p>Children's skin is thinner than adults', so even a short contact with a hot object or liquid can cause deeper burns or affect a larger area of the skin, and the consequences can be more severe and recovery longer. Accordingly, you must react quickly to prevent complications.</p>","<h2>First remove the cause of the injury (heat source)!</h2>

<h2><strong>Cool the injured area!</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Cool a minor burn with a stream of cold water or by immersion in cold water for at least 10-20 minutes, and then, if necessary, seek medical assistance.</li>
	<li>You can put cold compresses over the burn, preferably wet sterile gauze (30-45 min), but not ice! Cool the surface of the burn until the pain stops.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Remove clothes and jewelry! </strong></h2>

<p>Remove all clothing and jewelry from the burnt surface as soon as possible. Removing clothes and jewelry is important, because they can additionally retain heat on the skin and limit blood flow to the burned area, if there is swelling of the affected body part. Never forcibly remove clothes that are stuck on burnt skin, because you can cause additional injury; instead, cut the material around the wound or tear it at the seams.</p>

<h2><strong>Cover the burn!  </strong></h2>

<p>Gently cover the burn with sterile gauze or a clean cloth to prevent infection.</p>

<h2><strong>Relieve the pain!</strong></h2>

<p>According to the child's age, you can give him a pain medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen, in a dose according to his/her age), following the manufacturer's instructions in detail. If the child has not taken these medications before, be sure to consult your pediatrician because of the possibility of allergic reaction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the child is unconscious and shows no signs of life, it is necessary to start cardiopulmonary resuscitation immediately and call the emergency medical service as soon as possible (194).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What not to do?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Do not immerse babies and young children with larger burns in cold water, as they can get hypothermia, and large burnt areas must not be cooled for more than 5 minutes!</li>
	<li>Do not put oil, butter, or any other fat on the burn!</li>
	<li>Do not rub burns, as this may aggravate the injury.</li>
	<li>Never touch the burn or puncture the resulting blisters!</li>
	<li>Never yell at a child and scold him/her!</li>
	<li>Don't panic, because this will scare the child even more!</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Pay attention</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>First-degree burns (milder burns that look like sunburn and cover a small area of skin) can be treated at home.</li>
	<li>Larger and more severe burns (second- and third-degree burns) require urgent medical attention!</li>
	<li>In case of any burns in a baby or young child, consult your paediatrician!</li>

4246,Sunburn,"<p>Sunburn is very common in the summer months. In addition to momentary pain, it may have serious long-term consequences.</p>","<p>Unprotected skin exposed to strong sunlight can burn within 15 minutes. Children's skin is thinner, and its protective mechanism is weaker than in adults, so children turn red much faster. Sunburnt skin is red, painful and swollen, and blisters may occur.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cool the place with a stream of cold water or put cold compresses on it, and if a larger area is affected, shower the child with cold water (not ice-cold).</li>
	<li>You can apply an aloe-based preparation or some other preparation for the treatment of burns, but only with prior consultation with a doctor or pharmacist.</li>
	<li>If your child is in severe pain, you can give him/her a pain medication (paracetamol, ibuprofen) as recommended by your pediatrician.</li>

4251,How to prevent a dog bite?,"<p>Dog bites are more common in children than in adults, and the possibility of severe injuries is especially significant. Most bites come from familiar dogs, which emphasizes the importance of preventive measures.</p>","<ul>
	<li>Never leave your child alone with any dog.</li>
	<li>Teach your child to never approach an unfamiliar dog or a dog behind a fence on his/her own.</li>
	<li>If the dog has an owner, teach the child to pet it only with the owner's consent. Before petting, it is necessary for you and the child to gain the dog's trust - let it first take a look at you and sniff you. Do not look the dog in the eyes and avoid petting it on the head, legs, paws or tail.</li>
	<li>Teach children to treat dogs with dignity and unobtrusively - not to tease dogs, not to approach them suddenly, not to make sudden and quick movements, and not to shout and make noise near them.</li>
	<li>Do not allow children to play with dogs in a rough way or disturb them when they sleep, eat or care for their young. This can provoke the animal to attack.</li>
	<li>Teach your child not to pull the dog by the ears and tail; instead, show him/her how to pet it, gently, in the direction of hair growth, from head to tail.</li>
	<li>Teach your toddler not to try to snatch a toy from a dog's mouth.</li>
	<li>Since it is possible that the child and the dog may compete for food, do not feed the child near the pet or allow the child to disturb the pet while eating.</li>
	<li>Don't forget that hugging and kissing dogs is not natural for them and that such actions can scare the dog even more, especially if it is not your pet.</li>
	<li>If you are a dog owner, be sure to have your pet chipped and regularly vaccinated against rabies and other diseases, as advised by a veterinarian.</li>
	<li>Do not instill fear of dogs in your child; however, you must explain to him/her that a dog can sometimes be aggressive, bark and growl because it is hungry, scared, etc.</li>
	<li>If a child is afraid of dogs or a dog scares him/her at some point, teach him/her not to run away, but to stand still or move away slowly.</li>
	<li>What to do when confronted with an aggressive dog? If a child is confronted with a dog that growls, barks or otherwise behaves aggressively, it is necessary to remain level-headed, not to shout, not to look the dog in the eyes and slowly move away from the animal.</li>

4271,How to prevent insect bites?,"<p>Most insect stings are mild, causing only limited changes on the skin, itching or swelling at the sting site.</p>","<p> In some cases, the sting of a bee, wasp or hornet can cause life-threatening allergic reactions, while mosquitoes are potential carriers of various infectious diseases. Avoid places where insects gather - stagnant water in the nature or yards (swimming pools, fountains), flowering gardens, compost, bins and garbage containers. Empty the containers and drain unnecessary puddles of water around the house. Here's what else you can do to protect yourself from insect bites:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be cautious in traffic as well - insects can enter the vehicle through open windows, and disturb the driver and passengers.</li>
	<li>Install safety nets on windows and yard/balcony doors, and check their condition regularly.</li>
	<li>Find and remove insect nests with professional assistance, especially near places where children spend time and play.</li>
	<li>Also remove dead insects. Their stings are equally dangerous, regardless of the fact that the insect is incapacitated.</li>
	<li>Make the right choice of footwear for children. Instead of walking barefoot or wearing shoes with an open upper (sandals, slippers), shoes with a closed upper provide better protection against insect bites.</li>
	<li>Adjust children's clothing. Bright colors attract insects, while white, green and light shades of brown are more repulsive to them.</li>
	<li>Avoid using cosmetics and personal care products that contain strong scents.</li>
	<li>Some foods and drinks attract insects. Sweets, ice cream, fruit, sweetened drinks, watermelon and tuna are examples of foods that attract insects. Avoid them, or cover them when eating outdoors.</li>
	<li>Explain to the child how to behave when faced with dangerous insects. If there is a dangerous insect in the immediate vicinity, do not try to drive it away by waving, hitting, or running away, but slowly move away from the spot.</li>
	<li>Protect children from mosquitoes and ticks. Long sleeves and trouser legs, socks and a hat provide a greater degree of protection from mosquitoes during periods of their activity (in the evening), as well as from ticks when the child moves through the woods, tall plants or grass. After returning from the nature, be sure to examine the hair, head, neck, skin folds and the skin all over the child's body to detect any ticks.</li>
	<li>Examine pets after a walk in the nature, as ticks can be carried on fur.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case your child has ever had an allergic reaction to insect bites, in consultation with a doctor, make a plan of action in case of he/she is bitten again and inform everyone who cares for the child or is temporarily responsible for him/her (relatives, preschool or school teachers, etc.).</p>

4296,How to stop bleeding from injury,"<p>Bleeding can occur as a result of numerous ways of injury (from cuts, falls, to traffic accidents). The procedure for stopping bleeding depends on the nature of the injury, and knowing these techniques takes on an added importance in view of the possible health consequences that may occur.</p>","<h2><strong>Superficial wound </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Rinse the injured area with soap and water to remove dirt.</li>
	<li>Allow the wound to dry on its own.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Slight bleeding </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>After rinsing the wound, it is enough to press it with sterile gauze.</li>
	<li>If you do not have sterile gauze, use a clean tissue and secure it with a band-aid.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Heavier bleeding</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Stop the bleeding by direct pressure, by placing a roll of sterile gauze on the wound and holding the bleeding site with moderate pressure.</li>
	<li>Lift the bleeding body part to reduce blood flow to it.</li>
	<li>You can secure the sterile gauze with a bandage (if you have one), by wrapping the bandage around it.</li>
	<li>If you see blood breaking through the gauze and bandage, do not remove them; instead, increase the pressure by adding another gauze to the bleeding site.</li>
	<li>After 5-10 minutes, check if the bleeding has stopped.</li>
	<li>If the bleeding has not stopped or the edges of the wound are gaping, it is necessary to consult a doctor.</li>
	<li>Keep the wound pressed at all times until you arrive at the health facility.</li>
	<li>If you notice that this part of the body begins to turn blue or cool, release the pressure.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Extremely heavy bleeding: </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Apply direct pressure to the wound as described above and call the emergency medical service immediately (194).</li>
	<li>While waiting for the ambulance, keep the wound pressed all the time, and keep the affected body part raised.</li>
	<li>If you notice that this body part begins to turn blue or cool, release the pressure.</li>
	<li>Monitor the child's condition and comfort him/her.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What not to do:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Never remove objects from the wound as bleeding may increase!</li>
	<li>Do not put anything in the wound!</li>
	<li>Wounds that bleed profusely must not be rinsed!</li>

4311,Sunstroke and how to prevent it,"<p>Sunstroke is a violent reaction of the whole organism to excessive sun exposure, especially the head and neck.</p>","<p>Sunstroke can occur very quickly, especially if the child has been active in the sun, but delayed sunstroke is more common in children; it occurs a few hours after being in the sun - in the evening before bedtime or during sleep.</p>

<h2><strong>Sunstroke symptoms </strong></h2>

<p>Sunstroke symptoms can be early or delayed. Early sunstroke symptoms are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>sudden weakness of the child</li>
	<li>dizziness</li>
	<li>headache</li>
	<li>nausea</li>
	<li>vomiting</li>
	<li>drowsiness</li>
	<li>fever</li>
	<li>skin drenched in sweat</li>
	<li>trembling</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The younger the child, the more pronounced these symptoms, and the greater the possibility of complications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In ""delayed"" sunburn, the symptoms appear more slowly, are less intense, but last longer. Children are hot and flushed; they look like they are being affected by a virus, so parents are often confused, thinking that it is an infection. Young children become very cranky - they cry, seemingly for no reason. Older children usually have nausea (sometimes vomiting), mood swings and insomnia. As a rule, the body temperature is elevated.</p>

<h2><strong>How to prevent sunstroke?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Follow the information on the UV index published in the media and follow the recommendations provided.</li>
	<li>Young children can be exposed to the sun only at the recommended time (before 10 AM and late in the afternoon, after 5 pm), with the obligatory use of sunscreens with a high sun protection factor, according to age.</li>
	<li>Spend the part of the day when the sun is the strongest with your child in the shade or adequately cooled rooms.</li>
	<li>Dress your child in bright clothes made of natural materials.</li>
	<li>Put a cap or hat on his/her head, as well as sunglasses with adequate UV protection.</li>
	<li>Give your child plenty of fluids (especially water) throughout the day.</li>
	<li>Let him/her eat more frequent, light, less hearty meals.</li>
	<li>If you happen to be outside in the hottest part of the day, make sure that the child is less physically active, that he/she runs and jumps less to avoid overheating.</li>
	<li>Cool the child often with water - wash his/her face, wet his head, legs and arms.</li>

The first symptoms can appear quickly, but ""delayed"" sunburn occurs more often, a few hours after being in the sun - in the evening before bedtime or during sleep.</p>","<h2><strong>Get the child out of the sun</strong></h2>

<p>The child should first be moved out of the sun, if possible to an air-conditioned room, or at least a darkened and well ventilated room.</p>

<h2><strong>Shower the child with lukewarm water</strong></h2>

<p>Then leave him/her to dry without wiping.</p>

<h2><strong>Give your child enough fluids </strong></h2>

<p>A chilled soft drink (tea, juice or plain water) is much needed by a child who has sunstroke. The liquid should not be given in large quantities at once, but in small quantities more often, especially if the child has vomited. Even while drinking the first ""portion"" of water, he/she should be undressed and cooled.</p>

<h2><strong>Give the child medicine</strong></h2>

<p>If the body temperature is still high, the child should be given a medicines for lowering the temperature (antipyretic). It is best to put a suppository (paracetamol) in the rectum, because the effect is faster, and the possibility of vomiting is avoided. Of course, it is not wrong to give the medicine in the form of a syrup (ibuprofen or paracetamol). The medicine should be given in accordance with the child's age, following the manufacturer's instructions in detail. If the child has not taken these medications before, be sure to consult your pediatrician due to a possible allergic reaction.  </p>

<h2><strong>The child needs rest</strong></h2>

<p>For the next few hours, the child should rest, ideally sleep. Some parents are afraid to let their toddler sleep when he/she has sunstroke. This fear is unjustified, because he/she really needs rest, and sleep is the best way. Of course, during sleep, the body temperature should be checked, and in case of new spikes, medicine for lowering body temperature should be administered again. The medicine can be administered after only four hours from the previous dose, if you have given the child a suppository or paracetamol syrup. And if less time has passed, repeat the shower with lukewarm water. The day after sunstroke, sunbathing should be skipped.</p>

It usually occurs when humidity is increased during the summer heat, because such conditions hinder sweating. Children are at high risk of heatstroke, and the younger the child, the higher the risk.</p>

<h2><strong>Heatstroke symptoms are:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>high body temperature (above 40 °C),</li>
	<li>red, hot and dry skin,</li>
	<li>fast, shallow breathing,</li>
	<li>tachycardia - rapid heart rate (160-180 heartbeats per minute),</li>

	<li>low blood pressure,</li>
	<li>dizziness, headache, fatigue,</li>
	<li>nausea and vomiting,</li>
	<li>loss of consciousness (sometimes unconsciousness is the first sign),</li>
	<li>absence of sweating.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to prevent heat stroke? </strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure your child is getting enough fluids (always have water with you).</li>
	<li>Avoid staying in the sun, staying in warm and stuffy rooms, as well as excessive physical exertion of the child.</li>
	<li>As a basic form of prevention, an adequate choice of clothes suitable for weather conditions is recommended. In high heat, dress children in the lightest possible clothes. Dress the baby in a sleeveless onesie and never put socks on his/her feet.</li>
	<li>Older children should wear sleeveless shirts and shorts, and the best choice of footwear is open-toed, such as sandals.</li>
	<li>The diet should be balanced and light, rich in vitamins and minerals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Never leave children alone in the car and always keep the car locked, to prevent children from getting in without asking, while playing. Children are often victims of heatstroke in cars. It is enough to leave the child in the car for a short time while running an errand, and during that time - if your car is parked in the sun, the temperature in the car will rise significantly and endanger your child's health.</p>

4331,How to prevent frostbite?,"<p>Cold weather brings many challenges, and preventing frostbite is one of them. Children will often get carried away in winter games, without noticing frostbite warning signs. Frostbite is a local injury caused by freezing of the skin, and in severe cases, of deeper tissues (tendons, muscles, blood vessels). The occurrence of frostbite is affected by low ambient temperatures, intense flow of cold air (wind), prolonged exposure to cold, tight clothing and footwear (tight gloves, tight or tightly laced footwear).</p>","<h2>How to prevent it?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The child should wear multi-layered cold weather clothes. Take care to avoid overheating or sweating.</li>
	<li>Cover the affected body parts such as the cheeks, nose, ears. Provide a scarf, hat and mittens, preferably with thermal insulation and without separate fingers.</li>
	<li>Footwear must not be tight, or too stiff in the toe area, should have good thermal insulation and be waterproof.</li>
	<li>After an hour, ask the child to get away from the cold, have a hot beverage and change out of wet clothes.</li>
	<li>Take off his/her mittens gloves and check for first signs of frostbite, such as stiff fingers and pale skin. Many children do not notice that their fingers are stiff and numb, or do not want to go inside because they are having a wonderful time playing outside.</li>
	<li>Never ignore finger stiffness or numbness! They need to be warmed immediately (for example, put the hands under the armpits or on the tummy).</li>
	<li>Do not neglect the effect of cold wind!  Strong wind causes the body to lose heat faster, even when the thermometer does not show extremely low temperatures. </li>
	<li>Do not take babies and young children outside in very low temperatures and wind!</li>

Skin may blister or peel for several days after exposure to low temperatures.</p>","<h2><strong>What to do in case of frostbite</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make the child comfortable, i.e. take his/her wet clothes off him/her. Warm the affected body parts gradually using warm water (not hot) or body heat (e.g. by taking the child's hand in your hands, putting it under your armpits or on your stomach). While warming the child, constantly check the water temperature so that it does not cool down. Water should be constantly stirred around the frostbitten body part to distribute the heat evenly.</li>
	<li>Do not use dry heat sources (e.g. heated objects) as their effects are much harder to control and they can cause tissue burns.</li>
	<li>While warming a frozen area, the child can be expected to feel intense pain and complain about it. The frozen body part must be handled gently. </li>
	<li>Continue warming until the frostbitten body part becomes soft and the color and feeling return. After the treatment in a warm bath, dry the frostbitten body part by gently tapping it with a towel.</li>
	<li>Wrap the frostbitten area in dry sterile dressing.</li>
	<li>If the hand or foot is frostbitten, then sterile dressing should be placed between the fingers or toes, the limb raised to reduce swelling and the warmed body part protected from re-freezing.</li>
	<li>Depending on the child's age, you can give him/her a pain medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen, in a dose according to his/her age), following the manufacturer's instructions in detail. If the child has not taken these medications before, be sure to consult your pediatrician due to a possible allergic reaction.  </li>
	<li>Rehydrate the child by giving him/her plenty of fluids.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If your child has symptoms and signs of freezing and frostbite at the same time, you should always take care of freezing first!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>What should you not do?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Never rub a frozen area or put snow on it, as this will further damage it.</li>
	<li>Do not puncture blisters on a frostbite-affected area. Cover them lightly with sterile gauze or a clean dry cloth to prevent infection.</li>
	<li>Do not place frozen body parts on a radiator, heat them with hot compresses or a hot water bottle, or expose them to open heat sources such as fire.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>When should you see a doctor?</strong></h2>

<p>If you apply warm water, and the feeling and normal skin color are not restored within 20 minutes, or if blisters or blue swollen skin appear, an examination by a professional is necessary.</p>

<h2><strong>Body parts stuck on frozen surfaces</strong></h2>

<p>While playing, the child may touch a cold object with his/her tongue or lips, and then be unable to separate them because the body part attached to the surface has frozen. What to do in this case:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Calm the child so that he/she does not move, to avoid further injury.</li>
	<li>Do not pull the frozen body part or try to forcibly separate it from the surface.</li>
	<li>Gently pour warm (not hot) water on the surface of the object or skin that is stuck on the object.</li>

	<li>Clothes should be in layers, so that garments can be added or removed in accordance with the weather conditions and the child's physical activity.</li>
	<li>If the clothes get wet, change into dry ones as soon as possible.</li>
	<li>Give your child lots of hot, high-calorie drinks (like hot chocolate, etc.). If such drinks are not available, give him/her water to prevent dehydration.</li>

4351,How to prevent traffic injuries - a child as a pedestrian,"<p>Children in the role of pedestrians are a particularly vulnerable category of traffic participants. Whether due to inadequate road infrastructure, poor signage or other persons' negligence — children pedestrians require special attention from their parents.</p>","<ul>
	<li>When moving along a road with a child, hold the child firmly by the hand and explain to him/her the traffic situations when prerequisites are in place for the child to understand them.</li>
	<li>Teach the child the most important rules:
	<ul>
		<li>that the sidewalk is the safest place to move,</li>
		<li>to never run out into the street after a friend, a ball or some other toy,</li>
		<li>to cross the roadway only at the marked pedestrian crossing,</li>
		<li>to never run across a pedestrian crossing,</li>
		<li>to be careful even at a pedestrian crossing with traffic lights — to listen and observe traffic, on all sides, even though the green light is on for pedestrians,</li>
		<li>to adopt the rule of crossing the roadway — stop, wait, look left, right, then left again, listen and go,</li>
		<li>not to play in the parking lot and in the street,</li>
		<li>not to cross the street between parked vehicles.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When you wait for the child in front of a kindergarten, never do it across the street.</li>
	<li>For the child's better visibility on the road, wearing bright-colored or fluorescent clothing is recommended during the day; in case of reduced visibility and during the night, wearing reflective signs on clothes, backpack or shoes is recommended.</li>
	<li>No matter how big a hurry you may be in, if you are with a child, never commit traffic violations — do not cross the street outside the pedestrian crossing and the like, because by doing so, you risk both your lives!</li>

4386,Sudden death syndrome - causes and prevention,"<p>Sudden death syndrome is a sudden onset of death in a seemingly healthy child who has no symptoms or clinical picture of any disease. Depending on the age, we distinguish between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sudden unexplained death in childhood syndrome.</p>","<h2>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</h2>

<p>It occurs in children up to one year of age, mostly in their sleep. It most often occurs between the second and fourth month of life, it is more common in boys, in winter, and in children who do not breastfeed.</p>

<h2>Sudden unexplained death in childhood syndrome</h2>

<p>It occurs in a child older than one year, it also most often occurs in sleep, but it is less frequent than in infants.</p>

<p>The true cause of this condition has not yet been determined, but scientists believe that a combination of the child's developmental characteristics, maternal and environmental factors leads to its occurrence.</p>

<h2><strong>The most common risk factors</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>position - sleeping on the tummy,</li>
	<li>sleeping on too soft surfaces</li>
	<li>sleeping in the same bed with parents</li>
	<li>soft toys and pillows in the crib</li>
	<li>preterm birth or low birth weight</li>
	<li>the inability of the body to detect excess carbon dioxide in the blood</li>
	<li>difficulties waking up the child</li>
	<li>overheating of the body</li>
	<li>exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and after birth</li>
	<li>inadequate prenatal care</li>
	<li>poor socioeconomic living conditions</li>
	<li>babies from twin or multiple pregnancies</li>
	<li>short interval between pregnancies</li>
	<li>mother's age below 20 </li>
	<li>respiratory tract infections.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to reduce the likelihood of this condition?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The baby should sleep on his/her back (because it is the safest position - it reduces the probability of SIDS by 50%).</li>
	<li>The baby should sleep in his/her own crib.</li>
	<li>The baby should not sleep in the same bed with the parents, but should sleep in the same room with them.</li>
	<li>There should be no toys (especially plush ones), pillows or heavier bedding (quilts, heavier blankets, etc.) in the baby's crib.</li>
	<li>Avoid overheating the room where the baby sleeps and dressing the child too warmly. Room temperature should be 18-22 °C)</li>
	<li>Do not expose the baby to tobacco smoke - do not smoke in the room where the child is staying, and it is best to completely avoid smoking at home.</li>
	<li>Use a baby alarm - for continuous monitoring of the child and his/her condition.</li>
	<li>Breastfeed for at least six months, because it reduces the possibility of respiratory tract infections, which are one of the risk factors for the development of this condition.</li>
	<li>In older children, an adequate diet and sleep regime is important - the child should not go to bed immediately after a meal.</li>
	<li>If the child has difficulty waking up - this and similar disorders should be reported to the pediatrician.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>There are currently no products or agents on the market whose use can prevent sudden death syndrome. Knowledge of the basics and techniques of first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are essential for preventing deaths and parents are recommended to learn these skills.</p>

4391,Note on first aid,"<p>When you are in a situation to provide first aid to an injured child, first think about how much you know about it, whether you are the right person or it is better to leave it to professionals, so as not to aggravate the injury. While seeking the help of professional services, stay level-headed and communicate with the injured child, assure him/her that help is coming and that you are there for him/her.</p>","<p>Some of the recommended procedures in providing first aid require the application of special medical knowledge and skills (such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Heimlich maneuver, etc.).</p>

<p>The use of the information contained in the description of the recommended procedures cannot be a sufficient precondition for the successful application of some of them. Accordingly, it is recommended that all parents or caregivers be practically trained to act properly in situations where the child's health or life is endangered, in order to adopt the correct technique and adequate sequence of steps to be taken when checking vital signs, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and calling an ambulance, as well as other necessary first aid skills, knowledge and principles.</p>

<p>Since the child's age affects some first aid techniques to be applied, it is very important that parents and guardians are practically trained.</p>

<h3>Good positioning helps to ensure that your baby suckles well and helps you to produce a good supply of breast milk.  </h3>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>The four key points about your baby’s position are: straight, facing the breast, close, and supported:  </strong></p>

<p>1. The baby’s body should be straight, not bent or twisted, but with the head slightly back.  </p>

<p>2. The baby’s body should be facing the breast, not held flat to your chest or stomach, and he or she should be able to look up into your face.  </p>

<p>3. The baby should be close to you.  </p>

<p>4. You should support the baby’s whole body, not just the neck and shoulders, with your hand and arm.  <br />
<br />
<strong>There are different ways to position your baby:  </strong></p>

4406,Foot care,"<p>The foot is the body part that bears the entire body mass. From the child's birth, foot care is, therefor, one of the ""burning"" issues for parents, because it is related to motor activities, back pain and the like.</p>","<h2>Newborn feet</h2>

<p>Due to the position in the uterus, the newborn's feet can take different positions: close against lower legs, turned inwards or outwards... After examining the child, the doctor in the maternity ward will provide an opinion on whether there is a problem in the anatomical structure of the foot, if it is stiff and cannot be easily moved in all directions.</p>

<p>Further treatment of these deformities is the responsibility of pediatric orthopedists. The position of the feet that the fetus had in the uterus in the last trimester is also visible after birth. The foot is soft, you can easily move all the structures of the foot in all directions. Just like in the uterus, when a child is born, the movement of the whole body is evident, including foot movements. Picking up, carrying, turning, changing, bathing the child... In all these activities, changing the body position inevitably involves changing the position of the feet, whether the child is awake or sleeping. </p>

<p><strong>Foot exercises</strong>: tickling, pulling, stretching, do not make any sense because you perform them a couple of times during the day, and the foot is in motion through the movement of the whole body in continuity.</p>

<h2>Foot care while the child is learning to walk</h2>

<p>Increasingly active change of position during the first year of life means that the foot always needs to be positioned exactly in the way that will provide the most stable position to the body in order to free the hands for grasping. Learning to stand up and walk require supporting the entire body weight with the feet.</p>

<p>The child should not wear shoes to ""prevent"" foot deformation; the child learns to walk without shoes. Being barefoot is the best ""footwear"", as the child strengthens all foot structures by supporting him/herself on different surfaces, preferably on natural soil.</p>

<p>When learning to walk, some children will have their lower legs aligned outwards; this is known as ""bow legs"" and will be monitored by a competent pediatrician and, as needed, an orthopedist. Bow legs lead to a slight shift in weight distribution towards the outer part of the feet, but in the largest proportion of children, they are a normal, physiological phase in development.</p>

<p>Motor skills change quickly, and the child begins to climb, run, kick the ball, jump... All these activities engage the whole body, strengthen the muscles of the whole body, stabilize the body axis, thus changing the position of the feet.</p>

<h2>Strengthening foot structures in the second and third years of life</h2>

<p>Around the second year, the growth in height is more and more evident. The force of gravity shifts our center of gravity forward and parents notice that the knees are close together - knock-knees - which, in turn, shifts the weight distribution more towards the inner part of the foot. Follow-up by the selected pediatrician and, if necessary, an orthopedist continues. This physiological body position is not ""treated"" with orthopedic shoes and foot exercises, but - again - by engaging the whole body in age-appropriate activities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Child development is a complex process, and this applies to foot development too. The foot develops and strengthens its structure through whole-body activity. Special exercises only for the feet do not affect foot development. Preventive wearing of footwear, special orthopedic shoes and insoles in order to ""keep"" the anatomical structures under control for several hours during the day, passivates the foot and prevents the natural strengthening through active movement.</p>

4486,Verbal and physical interaction - Gender perspective,Parents and caregivers can deliberately or unconsciously transfer their own gender biases to their children.,"<p>Parents and caregivers can deliberately or unconsciously transfer their own gender biases to their children. From a young age, girls may be praised for their looks, whilst boys are encouraged for their physical strength. Parents may treat girls as more vulnerable while boys may be encouraged to ‘be strong’. Parents may be more overtly physically affectionate towards girls while more stoic towards boys. Therefore, through a system of social incentives and penalties, girls and boys are gradually taught to behave according to the pre-defined, accepted norms of their gender. Often by age three, children can begin identifying themselves as girls and boys, and by age five children can tell you “What girls do” and “what boys do”. In some contexts, girls are treated with greater neglect, for example provided lesser nutritional intake than boys, not provided primary health care, encouraged to take responsibility for household chores, etc. Moreover, social practices like child marriage and  early unions further promote discriminatory gender norms (Lundberg, 2005).</p>

<p><strong>Tips for parents:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>While children may develop at different rates, the developmental milestones for girls and boys are the same</li>
	<li>Ensure children of all genders are provide with equal and adequate nutritional and health services</li>
	<li>Ensure children of all genders are treated with love and care from birth.</li>
	<li>Parents and caregivers should refrain from strongly asserting gender identities on their children, while allowing a nurturing environment that enables learning and growth of individual agency e.g., toys that encourage building or creating something. Provide children with experiences including toys and games that are stereotypically associated with the opposite gender</li>
	<li>Avoid language or jokes that can reinforce gender stereotypes intended to be derogatory, e.g., ‘he cries like a girl’, ‘she’s such a tomboy’, ‘she’s too bossy’, ‘he’s too soft’, etc</li>
	<li>Ensure that parents and caregivers display gender-neutral behaviours or participate in behaviours stereotypically associated with the opposite gender, e.g., fathers cooking in the kitchen, mothers participating in outdoor sports, etc</li>
	<li>Encourage children of all genders to express their feelings and be emotionally open and honest towards children.</li>
	<li>Encourage children to build relationships with their peers</li>
	<li>Parents and caregivers are encouraged to participate in parenting training and education programs to enable development of their own skills and enhance awareness of their own biases</li>

4491,Toys and games – Gender perspective,"Traditionally, girls are encouraged to play with dolls while boys are encouraged to play outside. However, parenting practices initiate gender socialization of children, and can reinforce gender stereotypes of the roles men and women are traditionally expected to play in society.","<p>Traditionally, girls are encouraged to play with dolls while boys are encouraged to play outside. While this teaches girls to be caregivers from an early age, it prevents girls from developing cognitive, physical and social skills. Boys are given toys such as guns to play with and male caregivers often participate in more aggressive physical activities with boys. While these encourage aggression among boys, physical activity is essential for development of all children. It must be noted that the digital gaming industry is a fast-growing sector which is deeply gender-biased and sexualized in its content. This has the capacity to deepen gender biases among adolescents. Moreover, in many contexts, girls of five years and above are discouraged from playing and encouraged to focus on household responsibilities, therefore stagnating opportunities for learning, growth and social development.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for parents:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure children of all genders are given equal and adequate time to play and participate in household chores</li>
	<li>Ensure that children of all genders are encouraged to play with gender-neutral toys and games that develop the complete set of social and cognitive skills, literacy, numeracy, spatial skills and so on</li>
	<li>Encourage children to play with toys and games traditionally associated with the opposite gender, for example play with dolls as well as physically active games</li>
	<li>Avoid toys and games that deliberately encourage stereotypes, e.g., pink packaging, unicorns, rainbows for girls, etc. and ensure that toys and games given to children are inclusive and diverse in their representation</li>
	<li>Prevent children from playing with guns and violent toys, including overtly violent of sexualized digital games; replace violent and aggressive games with constructive physical activities</li>
	<li>Encourage children to translate anger and frustration into problem-solving, creativity and communication rather than use of aggression</li>

4501,Fathers’ engagement,"Fathers equally have strong innate capacities to bond with, relate with and care for infants. Father-infant bonding has both a hormonal/neurobiological basis and a psychological basis and is critical for development of a children.","<p>In most societies around the world, childcare is considered to be the mothers’ responsibility, while fathers are actively discouraged from participating in. National polices and businesses have codified such norms in the form of biased company policies, for example allowing no or only limited parental leave for fathers. These restrict the full enjoyment of parenthood among fathers and male caregivers, while placing considerable burden on mothers or female caregivers. It must be understood that fathers have strong innate capacities to bond with, relate with and care for infants. Father-infant bonding has both a hormonal/neurobiological basis and a psychological basis and is critical for development of a child (Family Included, 2018).</p>

<p><strong>Tips for parents:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Before your child is born, plan to take advantage of parental leave policies, manage work hours, etc. to make sure you are ready to dedicate adequate time for childcare and share household responsibilities with your partner.</li>
	<li>Becoming a father might feel overwhelming at first and involve a huge learning curve. You may feel that your partner has everything under control, while you don’t. Remember that all fathers have an innate ability to bond with and nurture their child and the experience of parenthood is very rewarding for both the child and parent</li>
	<li>Fathers and male caregivers should be encouraged to fully participate in childcare right from birth and be encouraged to engage in all activities including support with feeding, playing, bathing, kangaroo care, etc. Kangaroo care is known as parental skin-to-skin contact, particularly for newborns, is proven to have health benefits for children. Physical touch makes your baby feel safe and secure and builds trust and connection with you and stimulates your baby’s brain development</li>
	<li>Ensure health care workers and systems actively encourage fathers’ participation during child’s health check-ups, immunization, etc</li>
	<li>Ensure parental training and support (e.g., fathers’ groups) providing to create an enabling environment for fathers and male caregivers to develop skills and feel psychologically supported</li>
	<li>Spend one-on-one time with your baby: this provides the best opportunity to connect and build a bond, while also growing your child’s self-esteem.</li>
	<li>Talk often to your children, tell stories, sing, and encourage two-way communication</li>
	<li>Learn children’s cues through their behaviour and body language, e.g., a baby’s cry can sound different when they are hungry and when they are tired.</li>
	<li>Support partners with breastfeeding, understanding that this can often be challenging and exhausting during the first few months after birth, e.g., give encouragement, hold the baby between feedings, give a bottle as needed, etc.</li>

Care requires attention to the physical, mental and socio-emotional needs of caregivers.","<p>While parenting and childcare can in itself be stressful, such stresses can be aggravated by professional and other household responsibilities. It is important for caregivers and families to ensure they are able to balance their other responsibilities with childcare to ensure their children receive adequate protection and care. All forms of violence at home must be prevented as these create an environment that psychological affects the development and well-being of a child.

Over the decades, they have changed, thanks to knowledge about newborn physiology and needs.</p>","<h2><strong>Skin wiping  </strong></h2>

<p>Skin wiping stimulates the baby to start breathing on his/her own and prevents heat loss. The newborn's wet skin, especially the scalp, quickly gives off heat and it is the midwife's task to wipe and warm the baby as soon as possible.</p>

<p>By cutting the umbilical cord,<strong> </strong>the newborn finally separates from the mother's body and begins his/her independent journey through life. It is recommended<strong> </strong>to delay clamping the umbilical cord (putting a clamp interrupts blood flow through the umbilical cord) by at least 60 seconds after birth. This helps the baby's blood flow and breathing to adapt, and the baby also receives additional blood from the umbilical cord, which has a beneficial effect on the prevention of anemia in later months. After that, the umbilical cord is cut with scissors and tied with a string, or a special clip is placed on it. If dad attends the birth, he is usually offered to cut the umbilical cord. Cutting and attending to the umbilical cord does not hurt the baby!</p>

<h2><strong>Skin-to-skin contact </strong></h2>

<p>This<strong> </strong>is the next step if the child is vital and the mother is feeling well.</p>

<h2><strong>Putting on an identification wristband</strong></h2>

<p>This is the next step according to the maternity procedures; identification wristbands are fastened on the wrists of the mother and the newborn.</p>

<h2><strong>Measuring a newborn</strong> (length, weight and head circumference) </h2>

<p>This step is best postponed after skin-to-skin contact and the first breastfeed.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Bathing a newborn is not recommended, as it encourages cooling and removes the protective layer from the skin.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It is not recommended to separate the newborn from the mother, unless the mother or the child have an urgent health condition.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Preventive procedures, vaccines and screenings</strong></h2>

<p>Immediately after birth, the baby receives vitamin K (a small muscular injection given in the front part of the newborn's thigh) in order to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. On the first day, the baby receives the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine; it is administered in the same manner as vitamin K, only in the other leg. Before discharge, he/she receives the tuberculosis vaccine (BCG vaccine); it is applied to the skin on the outside of the left upper arm. A blood sample is taken from all babies for metabolic screening. In accordance with national recommendations, all newborn children undergo hearing screening.</p>",6386,2,43,59,60,"1306, 541","4586, 4581",0,1,"<p>Janković B.

4581,Apgar score - assessment of babies at birth,"<p>Apgar score is a method of assessing the condition of a newborn immediately after birth, so that the newborn receives appropriate assistance, if necessary. A low score in the first minutes usually does not mean that the child will have some developmental problems later, and a high score is not in itself a guarantee of the expected psychomotor development.</p>","<h2>What is the APGAR score and how is it determined</h2>

<p>In 1952, anesthesiologist Dr. Virginia Apgar devised a rapid and comprehensive method for assessing the vitality of the newborn immediately after birth, aiming to focus the attention of delivery room staff on the newborn too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The APGAR score is a number/score calculated by assessing five clinical signs in a newborn: heart rate, respiratory movements, reflex reactions (baby's reaction to a catheter in the nose), muscle tone, and skin color.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each score parameter can be rated 0, 1, or 2, so the score can be 0-10. The Apgar score is determined 60 seconds after the complete birth of the child, as well as after 5 minutes. Score values of 8-10 indicate that the newborn is in excellent condition and only needs routine care in the delivery room. Values of 5-7 indicate that the baby is a little ""tired"", while values of 0-4 mean that the newborn needs immediate assistance. If, despite the resuscitation measures taken, the score remains low, i.e. the baby does not recover, the score is determined again after 10, 15 and 20 minutes, in parallel with the application of the necessary resuscitation procedures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The APGAR score in 1st minute only serves the staff attending the birth as an aid in assessing whether the child needs any of the support measures. The APGAR score in 5th minute serves to assess the child's recovery and reaction to the resuscitation measures taken and has no great prognostic significance. Only a prolonged low score has prognostic significance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>To understand the importance of ""birth assessment"", it is important to know:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The APGAR score is a subjective method.</li>
	<li>It is not completely adapted to preterm babies</li>
	<li>Newborn depression caused by medications received by the mother during childbirth can also affect the assessment values (painkillers, anesthetics, sedatives).</li>
	<li>Although many babies get a ""perfect ten"", there are really few babies who actually get a 10 in 5th minute, and especially in 1st minute.</li>
	<li>A score of 8 or 9 is excellent and has the same value as a ten.</li>
	<li>The APGAR score in 5th, 10th and 30th minute provides a better insight into the newborn's adaptation to life in the external environment and has a better prognostic value. A low score is a signal to the pediatrician to monitor the baby's psychomotor development more intensively.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many factors that affect the development of the child during life in the mother's womb and there is no score or method that immediately after birth can provide a complete insight into the child's condition and all its developmental potentials.</p>",4161,2,43,59,60,"1321, 1306, 5421","4526, 4611, 4586",1,0,"<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn (2015).

4586,What a newborn looks like right after birth,<p>The appearance and behavior of a newborn immediately after birth can confuse or worry you. Most often it is just your fear whether everything is okay with the baby and the different expectations you may have had of what your baby will look like when he/she is born.</p>,"<p>The moment of your child's birth is both magical and stressful. Often your baby looks or behaves differently than you expected. Most often, these are temporary or harmless problems, or there is no reason to worry at all.</p>

<h2>Skin</h2>

<p>Important changes occur when a child suddenly arrives from a protected, quiet and warm environment in the outside world. <em>That is why it is common for a newborn to be blue or purple in the first minutes after birth</em> ; if he/she breathes well, is warm and dry, the skin will gradually turn pink in the next 7 to 10 minutes. The blue color of the hands and feet can last up to 24 hours. </p>

<p>Before birth, th<em>e </em>baby's skin is covered in <em>white, greasy substance called vernix caseosa or just vernix. </em>Preterm babies usually have a thick layer of vernix, especially in skin folds. It is not recommended to remove the vernix after birth, because it has a protective role.</p>

<p>The newborn's face may be blue, sometimes with swollen eyelids. This usually occurs if the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck, leading to the rupture of tiny capillaries in the skin; it slowly recedes in the following days, but may cause more intense jaundice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newborn skin may flake or even peel; this usually happens to babies born after the expected due date. The skin and nails may be green, if the amniotic fluid was green (which means that the baby passed stool - meconium before birth).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Head shape</strong></h2>

<p>Newborn children have a proportionately larger head in relation to the body than older children and adults. This disproportion is especially pronounced in preterm and thin babies.</p>

<p>It is normal for the head to be elongated immediately after birth; the newborn's skull bones are soft, which is necessary in order to pass through the birth canal as easily as possible. Caput succedaneum is often present, most often on the back part of the crown of the head, sometimes more to the left or right. It can sometimes be very large, like a hat on a baby's head (especially if the baby was born with vacuum), but it recedes extremely fast, after only a few hours. From the second day of life, some babies may notice a cephalohematoma, a ""nodule"" that is located laterally on the crown of the head, on one or both sides. Cephalohematoma is considered a birth injury, but it is also a harmless problem and gradually recedes over the next few weeks, depending on the size.</p>

<p>The head shape at birth can be influenced by numerous other factors, such as preterm birth, twin or multiple pregnancy, lack of amniotic fluid. Babies who were in the pelvic position during pregnancy have a specific head shape at birth and all look alike. The face is round, the crown of the head is flattened, and the head elongated in the direction of the occiput.</p>

<p>In any case, the head shape will change in the first few weeks - it will become more regular and slowly take the shape that is ""set"" by the genes.</p>

4601,How to soothe a crying baby,"<p>To soothe a crying baby, check if he/she is hungry, tired, uncomfortable or sick. Don't expect to be able to recognize your baby's needs at any time, this is something you learn day by day.</p>","<h2>Baby soothing tips:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Check if the baby needs to have his/her diapers changed, if he/she is too hot or too cold.</li>
	<li>Offer your baby to suckle if you think he/she is hungry or more than two hours have passed since the previous meal (the same recommendation applies for artificially-fed babies).</li>
	<li>Offer to breastfeed even if the baby is not hungry, because sometimes he/she needs to suckle. You can also offer a pacifier, but avoid them during the first month of life.</li>
	<li>Talk to your baby gently, sing or play soothing music. Sometimes a child just needs to know that you are there and your voice can calm him/her down.</li>
	<li>The person calming the baby should be alone with him/her in the room, calm and patient. In case of persistent crying (infantile colic), take turns with other family members.</li>
	<li>Some noise sources (so-called white noise) such as a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner can calm the baby.</li>
	<li>Gently rock or carry the baby in a carrier or scarf. Sometimes the parents' movement and closeness can calm the baby.</li>
	<li>A walk with a stroller can also calm the baby. It is not recommended to leave the baby to sleep in the stroller unattended</li>
	<li>Massage can soothe your baby and relax you. The massage also strengthens the bond with the baby.</li>

4606,Neonatal conjunctivitis and blocked tear duct,"<p>Mild eye irritation or discharge, narrowed or blocked tear duct, and conjunctivitis are the most common problems and eye infections in newborns and babies.</p>","<h2><strong>Conjunctiva</strong> </h2>

<p>It is a transparent, smooth and shiny structure that connects the back surface of the eyelid and the eyeball. Infection and inflammation of the conjunctiva, which occur during the first month of a baby's life, are called</p>

<p>Neonatal conjunctivitis (Ophtalmia neonatorum).  <em>Purulent inflammation</em> is caused by an infection during delivery, i.e. the passage of the fetus through the birth canal. They can be caused by bacteria or viruses. The most common infections are gonococcus (gonorrhea), streptococcus, chlamydia, and the herpes virus. </p>

<p>Symptoms appear from 5 days to 2 weeks after birth. These are soreness, abundant purulent secretion, redness of the eyelids and conjunctiva. An eye swab must be done and treatment must be started immediately.</p>

<p>In order to prevent neonatal ophthalmia, antibiotic drops or other solutions (usually povidone iodine in a form adapted for application to the eye) are applied immediately after the birth of all newborn babies. These medicines can also lead to <em>aseptic inflammation</em> (chemical conjunctivitis). They appear immediately after the application of the medicine and are usually not severe. They often occurred when silver nitrate solution was used for this purpose. They manifest themselves in redness and swelling of the newborn's conjunctiva and eyelids. They pass within a few days; sometimes it is necessary to rinse the eyes.</p>

<h2><strong>Blocked tear duct</strong></h2>

<p>Tears flow from the eye into the nose through a narrow tear duct, whose opening is located in the inner corner of the eye. One in twenty babies has a blocked tear duct in one or both eyes. </p>

<p>Symptoms of a blocked tear duct can appear already in the first days of life, or later during the first month. It usually resolves spontaneously, but it must be addressed if symptoms of infection are present. It manifests itself in watery eyes or purulent secretion. Occasionally there may be swelling and redness in the depression along the nasal bone below the inner eye corner.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Massage under the inner corner of the eye will help to empty the secretion accumulated in the canal.</li>
	<li>If there are signs of infection, the doctor will prescribe antibiotic eye drops to the baby.</li>
	<li>If your baby does not have frequent infections and pronounced watering of eyes, be patient, because by the end of the first year, the problem usually resolves spontaneously; learn how to properly clean the baby's eyes.                                                               </li>
	<li>If the symptoms recur and do not disappear by the end of the first year, the eye doctor will widen the canal with a fine probe and solve the problem.</li>

4611,Skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth,"<p>The direct contact between the mother and the healthy newborn immediately after birth is precious and indispensable. It makes it easier for the baby to adapt to the external environment, encourages the establishment of a close relationship between the mother and the baby and a good and successful initiation of breastfeeding.</p>","<h2><strong>The mother is here again!  </strong></h2>

<p>Through the skin, the newborn feels the warmth of your body and your touch; he/she has a feeling of being hugged. He/she hears your familiar voice and your heartbeat, an already familiar sound. Makes eye contact. The first eye contact between the mother and the baby is a moment whose significance cannot be emphasized enough, it is a moment you will never forget. This intense moment is often decisive for the mother's decision to breastfeed.</p>

<h2><strong>Body contact </strong></h2>

<p>The baby's contact with the mother's body calms both the mother and the child, helps to stabilize the child's heart rhythm and breathing, keeps the child warm thanks to the mother's body heat,<strong> </strong>helps in the newborn's metabolic adjustment and stabilization of blood sugar,<strong> </strong>prevents the child's crying, reducing stress and energy consumption,<strong> </strong>enables colonization of the child by maternal bacteria, facilitates the connection between mother and child,<strong> </strong>allows the baby to find the breast and latch on with his/her mouth.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Contact should be made immediately<strong>,</strong> even before cutting the umbilical cord, or as soon as possible during the first few minutes.</li>
	<li>The duration of contact should be at least one hour.</li>
	<li>A cesarean section under spinal/epidural anesthesia also allows skin-to-skin contact.</li>
	<li>In case of a caesarean section under general anesthesia, the baby can make contact with the father immediately after birth, and with the mother after she wakes up (in several hours).</li>
	<li>In twins, the first twin can have physical contact with the mother until the birth of the second one begins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to provide skin-to-skin contact</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The naked child is put on the mother's bare chest and abdomen.</li>
	<li>The child can be wiped before this to stimulate breathing and crying. The palms are not wiped, the familiar smell of amniotic fluid soothes the newborn.</li>
	<li>The child is positioned on the mother's abdomen on his/her tummy, with arms open, legs slightly apart and bent.</li>
	<li>The child must have a hat put on and be covered with a towel or compress.</li>
	<li>The nose and mouth must not be covered, the head is turned to the side, with the neck straight without leaning forward, to ensure the airways are open.</li>
</ul>

4616,Early detection of metabolic disorders in newborns,"<p>Most newborns are healthy. However, a number of children are born with congenital diseases that can be treated successfully if detected in time.</p>","<p>In our country, screening is conducted for two congenital metabolic diseases: hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria. These diseases cannot be detected at birth by the usual examination; hence, all newborn children undergo an early detection program. A specific feature of these diseases is that, if the treatment is not started on time, they lead to the child's permanent and severe mental retardation, as well as slower physical development.</p>

<p>The treatment of both diseases is simple: hypothyroidism is treated with thyroxine tablets and phenylketonuria with a special diet. Children who start treatment in the first month of life have normal growth and development and do not differ from their peers.</p>

<p>In order to detect these diseases early, in all developed countries worldwide, as well as in our country, tests are performed on all newborns' blood samples. These tests are the only sure way of detecting the disease and starting treatment on time!</p>

<p>A blood sample is taken at the maternity hospital, at the earliest in 48th hour of the child's life. The sample is taken from the newborn's heel by applying drops of blood to the filter paper on a special metabolic screening card. The cards are sent to a central laboratory for metabolic testing.</p>

<p>If the test results are normal, you will not be notified. However, if any test result deviates from the norm, you will be asked to come to the hospital in a timely manner. The screening test does not diagnose the disease, but rather identifies suspected cases. Additional testing should be performed as soon as possible, so that treatment can be started in a timely manner, if necessary.   </p>

<p>A repeat test is necessary if the first sample was not valid, if the child was born prematurely, if he/she received a blood transfusion. The test results are stored in the central laboratory.</p>",9091,2,43,59,60,"5331, 131","5036, 4951, 4441, 4466, 4476",0,0,"<p>Janković B.

4621,The baby is born - the way to end the birth and the newborn,"<p>How the baby will look and behave depends on numerous factors, mostly on the child's maturity, method and course of delivery.</p>","<p>After an uncomplicated vaginal birth, most babies will cry a few seconds after birth. If the baby adapts well to the conditions outside the uterus, the midwife will place him/her on your chest and abdomen. This skin-to-skin contact helps the baby maintain heat, stabilize breathing and heart rhythm, and is the best start in establishing physical and emotional connections between you and your child. It is also the first, important step in initiating breastfeeding.</p>

<p>After a vacuum or forceps birth, most babies will cry immediately after birth. If any assistance and support in starting to breathe is needed, the midwife will take him/her to a heated table, where the baby will be provided assistance. When the baby establishes good breathing, is active and his/her skin is pink, he/she is returned to the mother for skin-to-skin contact.</p>

<p>A baby born by vacuum extraction often has a large caput succedaneum and a mark from the vacuum cup; after the application of forceps, a mark or hematoma from forceps blades can be seen on the face. All these changes recede quickly and do not affect the child's health.</p>

<p>After a planned caesarean section, the midwife picks up the newborn in the operating room, assesses his/her breathing on a heated table, wipes him/her and attends to the umbilical cord stump. Spinal or epidural anesthesia enables you not to miss that magical moment, to see your newborn and hear his/her first cry. Inquire if the maternity hospital offers the possibility of skin-to-skin contact in the operating room immediately after the child is born.</p>

<p>Newborns born by emergency cesarean section<strong> </strong>are more likely to have problems adapting. The midwife takes the child to a heated table, where the pediatrician assesses his/her vitality and provides the necessary assistance. If you are under general anesthesia during the surgery, you will see the baby after waking up. If your baby needs an incubator or other additional care, you will get information from a pediatrician.</p>

<p>During a caesarean section, especially an emergency one, a cut can occur on the baby's presenting part, most often the head, sometimes the buttocks in case of the pelvic presentation. These cuts are usually superficial, heal in a few days and do not leave a scar. It is usually enough to apply an adhesive strip to cuts, it is rarely necessary to suture the injury. These cuts are sterile, so there is no risk of infection or the need for anti-tetanus protection.</p>",5296,2,43,59,60,"71, 1311, 1511","4586, 4636, 3801",1,0,"<p>Janković B.

4626,Newborn crying,"<p>Crying is the way a baby communicates with his/her surroundings. Babies cry often and a lot (at least that's how it seems to parents) and their crying always means that they have a need that should be met. These needs are usually simple and can be met by feeding, changing, warming or cuddling.</p>","<p>The first days after a baby arrives in the family are the most difficult for parents. You will quickly learn to recognize your child's needs and respond to them. In the beginning, create a checklist of things that need to be checked in order to find a solution and go step by step:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Hunger is the most common reason for crying, and the younger the baby, the greater the chance that he/she wants milk.  So try feeding first. If you are breastfeeding, put the baby to the breast as often as possible in the first days, to stimulate lactation. Of course, this doesn't mean that a crying newborn is always hungry! First remember when the last breastfeed was; if less than an hour has passed, consider another reason for crying. If you always try to calm the newborn by breastfeeding, you will create a confused, insecure baby who will find it difficult to separate from the breast.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The baby may need a diaper change. Some babies do not immediately react when they fill the diaper, and some want to be changed immediately. In any case, always take a look at the diaper because it is worth trying changing him/her.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The baby is cold or too hot. Be careful not to warm the baby too much; the rule is: the baby needs only one layer of clothes more than you. If the back of the baby's neck is hot and wet, he/she is probably too warm and you need to make him/her comfortable and check if the room is overheated.  If the baby is cold, the fastest and best way to warm up is the mother's body, preferably skin-to-skin.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The baby wants his/her mom, because every baby needs mother's love, attention and closeness. Maybe your baby just wants you to cuddle and hold him/her and hear your voice. Sometimes it is enough to just hold him/her close to feel your heartbeat and your smell.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Infantile colic usually occurs after the second week of life.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Your personal mood can also be a reason why your child is agitated. Maybe it’s evening and you’re tired; you may be annoyed by your child's sensitivity. Knowing that your child often just reacts to your mood can help you be calmer with him/her.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Excessive engagement with the child can sometimes make an upset child cry even harder. If you hand him/her over to each other, if you change his/her diapers when it is not needed, if you offer him/her to eat over and over again, if you discuss his/her crying in a worried tone, you can upset him/her even more, and it will lead to even more crying.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your baby cries persistently and inconsolably and you can't calm him/her down, check:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If the nose is congested - cleaning the nose - rinsing with saline solution - can be of great help.</li>
	<li>Ear inflammation can also be accompanied by sudden and inconsolable crying, but it is a much rarer cause of crying than previously thought.</li>
	<li>If the baby has a rash in the diaper region.</li>
	<li>Check the boy's scrotum and groin area in both sexes. A pinched hernia is manifested by swelling that is hard, red and extremely painful. This is a condition that requires urgent surgical intervention. Babies tolerate these surgeries very well, stay in the hospital for a short time and recover quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>When should you take a child to the doctor immediately?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The baby's persistent crying and agitation are accompanied by difficulty breathing or rapid breathing, pale or blue lips, vomiting, diarrhea, or the appearance of blood in the stool.</li>
	<li>Unusual, monotonous crying or screaming, high-pitched cry, accompanied by a change in behavior.</li>
	<li>When a baby cries painfully and you cannot comfort him/her in any way that worked previously, or you do not understand the reason for crying.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>React to the baby's crying. When you do that, you are teaching your baby that he/she is precious, that the world can be trusted. Don't be afraid that you will spoil your child. The amount of love you give to a baby cannot be too great. It is the foundation for your child to grow into a person who will realize all his/her potentials, who will be self-confident and satisfied, capable of giving love to his/her partner and children.</p>

4631,Can the baby's sleeping position affect the shape of the head?,"<p>Pressure on the baby's soft skull can change the shape of his/her head and lead to deformity (plagiocephaly). Fortunately, the problem is usually temporary, and you can prevent it by properly positioning the baby.</p>","<p>Parents sometimes notice that the baby's head is flattened in the back or on the side. Head asymmetry can be present at birth: preterm babies are more prone to cranial deformities, because their head bones are softer. It is more common in twins and multiple pregnancies, where one fetus puts pressure on another. Lack of amniotic fluid can also be the cause of transient, positional asymmetry of the head present at birth. The most common cause is sleeping position. Sleeping on the back does not allow a lot of turning; more precisely, it requires a static position, unlike sleeping on the tummy.</p>

<p>Babies tend to sleep with their head turned to the left or right. Because the baby's skull is extremely soft, by constantly pressing on the mattress, the head can take on an asymmetrical shape. A ""crooked neck"" or toricollis forces the baby to keep his/her head in the same position all the time. A much rarer, but also more serious cause of asymmetry of the head is craniosynostosis - premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, which should be detected and treated in a timely manner, because it can leave permanent consequences.</p>

<p>The pediatrician checks the shape of the baby's head during comprehensive health checks, but parents are also advised to consult a doctor if they notice that the baby's head looks asymmetrical.</p>

<h2>Are positional head deformities dangerous?                                                                                        </h2>

<p>Parents are often concerned that this problem could affect brain development and may be a cause or sign of disability. With the exception of craniosynostosis, which limits brain growth, plagiocephaly is usually a temporary condition and does not cause more serious consequences for the baby's proper development<strong>.</strong> The symptoms are the most pronounced between 6th and 8th week; they subside as soon as the child starts to sit and disappear by 18th month. However, with more pronounced deformities, although the condition improves over time, some degree of flatness remains permanently. <strong>           </strong></p>

<h2>How to prevent a positional deformity of your baby's head?<strong>                                                           </strong></h2>

<p>Fortunately, this can be achieved very easily. Do not leave your baby in one position often.</p>

<p>The second, and most important, thing in preventing plagiocephaly is to make sure your baby doesn't spend a lot of time on his/her back while awake.<em>                </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Allow your baby to spend as much time on his/her tummy as possible while he/she is awake during the day, under your supervision. Encourage him/her to try new positions during playing time.</li>
	<li>In addition to preventing plagiocephaly, you will also prepare him/her for other developmental activities that follow in his/her development, such as sitting and turning.</li>
	<li>Take your child out of the crib more often.                                                                                              </li>
	<li>When you put your baby in the crib, try to make sure he/she is not always in the same position.</li>
	<li>Change the head position while the baby is sleeping.</li>
	<li>Deliberately arrange toys and little things that attract the baby's attention on all sides of the crib, so that he/she moves his/her head in different directions as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Alternate the baby's orientation in the crib (alternate feet and head positions each time) so that your baby turns his/her head in the opposite direction to see you.</li>
	<li>Use different options in strollers, car seats and swings. Attach items to different sides at different times.</li>
	<li>If your older child often rides with the baby in the car, take care which side he/she sits on, because the baby will naturally turn his/her head in that direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Breastfeeding naturally makes moms hold the baby on both sides, which helps the head develop more properly. In case you bottle-feed your baby, make sure to alternate sides. Make sure that the child always sleeps on his/her back, because it is the safest for him/her! Positioning pillows are neither effective nor safe for a child.</p>",3791,2,"43,44,45,46",59,60,"1761, 111","4381, 3346",1,0,"<p>Dec, W., &amp; Warren, S. (2011).

By providing warmth, love, security and attention, you can help your baby adjust more easily and better.</p>","<p>Before discharge from the maternity hospital, read the discharge report carefully and, if necessary, seek additional information from the pediatrician about regular or, if recommended, additional specialist examinations. Find out if you can take the baby to the maternity clinic for an examination, if necessary.</p>

<p>After being released from the maternity hospital, the care of the mother and the newborn is taken over by the visiting nurse from the health center. If you think your baby has a problem or are concerned about something, talk to your nurse or doctor. </p>

<h2>The appearance of a newborn </h2>

<p>The caput succedaneum recedes and the newborn's head ""returns"" to its normal shape. If they were present at birth, both facial and eyelid swelling as well as hematomas and broken capillaries on the facial skin withdraw. Jaundice may occur: the skin on the face and body, as well as eye whites, turn yellow.</p>

<p>The umbilical stump dries slowly, turns black and eventually falls off, usually by 10th day of life. Make sure to keep the umbilical stump clean and dry. If the skin around the stump becomes red or sticky, seek professional assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Various changes - birthmarks can appear</strong> on a newborn's skin; they are either present at birth or detected later. They are common and usually harmless, but if you are worried, consult a visiting nurse or doctor.</p>

<p>Weight loss is an anticipated and physiological phenomenon in the first days of life; the stomach is small and, with the first meals, the baby gets only 5-10 milliliters of milk. The child passes an abundant first stool (meconium) and sometimes also excess fluid, which occurs if the mother receives a larger amount of fluid through an IV drip during childbirth or cesarean section. Babies usually leave the maternity hospital with a weight that is 5-7% below their birth weight, and the maximum loss that should not worry parents or doctors, if the child is healthy and suckles well, is 9-10%. If a greater weight loss occurs, the baby and mother remain in the maternity hospital until it is confirmed that the baby suckles well and begins to gain weight. Return to birth weight is expected between  10th and 14th day of life. A mistake you should definitely avoid is the unnecessary introduction of formula supplementation!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seek medical attention as soon as possible if your baby:  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>has difficulty feeding (during the previous 24 hours he/she suckled infrequently and briefly, or took only half of the meal from the bottle, gags or vomits frequently) </li>
	<li>is very upset, or sleepy and has difficulties waking up</li>
	<li>the skin is pale or yellow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The rhythm of feeding and sleeping during the first week of life</h2>

<p>During the first week of life, your newborn spends the most time sleeping, waking up every few hours for feeding. Newborn babies cannot sleep through the night, their stomachs are small and they need frequent meals.</p>

<p>In the first days, and even weeks, the baby does not have an established rhythm of wakefulness and sleep. A newborn sleeps an average of 18 hours a day, so - except during changing and feeding - the waking periods are short.</p>

<p>Most babies need feeding every 2-4 hours and usually have 8-12 meals in 24 hours. A newborn's stomach is small and cannot receive a large amount of milk. The composition of breastmilk allows it to be digested very quickly, within 90 minutes, so the child soon becomes hungry again. Every baby has a distinct personality from birth; even very young babies have their own feeding habits, as do adults. Some babies suckle 6-8 times a day, while others like to ""snack"" more often, so they have 12-14 meals.</p>

<p>Most babies wake up on their own during meals, but it usually takes time for the baby to establish its feeding and sleeping rhythm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some babies are drowsy and more passive in the first weeks (especially preterm babies, babies with low birth weight or those who had a health problem or greater weight loss in the first days). These babies should be woken up every three hours and changed to wake up, skin-to-skin contact should be used to stimulate more active suckling, and their weight should be checked more often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The baby adapts and reacts to the environment day by day, and parents learn to recognize their baby's needs. The baby signals what he/she wants, you try to figure out his/her needs, you do everything you have learned, heard, assumed, and somewhere along that learning path, an understanding of the baby's needs gradually develops. This period of getting to know each other can be challenging. In order to provide peace and rest to yourself and your child, postpone the celebration of the child's birth, the gathering of family and friends. It takes at least a month to recover from childbirth, adapt to the baby's rhythm, make sure that breastfeeding works well. When mom, dad and the baby start functioning as a coordinated and smoothly-run team, there will be time for celebrations and socializing.</p>

<p>In the first weeks after the birth of a child, you should also think about yourself. This means that you should have regular meals, some physical activity, and sleep while the baby sleeps, which will allow you to make up for the lack of sleep. If you need it, seek help from family and friends!</p>

4641,Newborn hearing test,"<p>Newborn hearing test (universal neonatal hearing screening) enables timely detection of hearing impairment, rehabilitation and treatment.</p>","<p>Hearing impairment is one of the most common congenital anomalies. Severe hearing impairment affects 1 out of 1000 newborn babies, many of whom have no risk factors or symptoms at birth.</p>

<h2>How is a hearing test performed?</h2>

<p>The most commonly used method for screening a newborn's hearing is TEOAE<strong> </strong>(transient otoacoustic emission). It is simple and reliable, with no pain or discomfort for the baby, and lasts for a few minutes. It is performed by placing a soft ear tip in the baby's outer ear canal and registering the signal on the device.</p>

<p>Treatment of children with hearing impairment should be started as early as possible, because it ensures excellent results in speech and language abilities. It is recommended to perform screening by the end of 1st month, complete diagnostics by the end of 3rd month, and start rehabilitation by 6th month.</p>

<p>For practical reasons, almost everywhere, hearing screening is performed in the maternity hospital.</p>

<h2>If the child does not pass the test in the maternity hospital, does that mean that he/she has a hearing impairment?</h2>

<p>No, it does not! The presence of amniotic fluid or vernix in the outer ear canal, noise in the room, the baby's crying, and even the sounds made by the baby sucking or breathing if his/her nose is congested interfere with the test. If the newborn does not pass the initial test, it is repeated after a few weeks (the retest).  It is the most practical for parents to have the retest performed in the maternity hospital. If the baby does not pass the retest, he/she is referred for further examination by an audiologist. TEOAE is a screening method, which means that it is not used to make a diagnosis, but to detect children who need additional examination.</p>

<p>Hearing testing in the maternity hospital is not enough for all children. Some children need further hearing monitoring and testing even though they have passed the maternity hospital test. These are children at risk of hearing impairment: preterm babies, children with severe asphyxia at birth, with other congenital anomalies, children who have recovered from bacterial meningitis, children from families with hereditary deafness, etc.</p>

<p>Maternity hospital screening only detects children with hearing impairment at birth. In some children, the impairment manifests itself later, or is mild. Despite passing the test in the maternity hospital, it is still necessary to monitor how the child reacts to sounds, his/her speech development and behavior, and contact a doctor as soon as possible if you suspect that the child cannot hear. If there is hereditary deafness in the family, hearing loss can also manifest itself later and these children should be under the supervision of an audiologist.</p>

<h2>Why it is important to detect hearing impairment in time</h2>

<p>It is very important to recognize hearing impairment as early as possible, in order to avoid a delay in speech and communication development. Rule 1-3-6 means that hearing screening should be performed in the first month of life, examination and diagnosis of a child who has not passed the test should be completed by 3rd month and rehabilitation of hearing function must begin by 6th month of life at the latest. This ensures that the child fully develops language and speech abilities, and thus realizes his/her full potentials.  Hearing rehabilitation is performed by an audiology team, with the involvement of other professionals as needed. If the child has severe bilateral impairment, a hearing aid is sometimes not enough and the problem is successfully solved by installing a cochlear implant.</p>",6271,2,43,59,60,"131, 541","4441, 3611",0,0,"<p>Ravi, R., Gunjawate, D.R., Yerraguntla, K., Lewis, L.E., Driscoll, C., Rajashekhar, B.

4646,Neonatal jaundice,"<p>Jaundice is a common cause of a newborn's prolonged stay in the maternity hospital, and sometimes causes (unnecessary) concern for the parents. It is most often transient jaundice during the period of adaptation, rather than a disease in the newborn.</p>","<p>Jaundice is yellow discoloration of the skin and eye whites. So, jaundice is a symptom, rather than a disease and we can say that someone has jaundice, not that they suffer from jaundice. The yellow color comes from bilirubin, which is a product of the normal breakdown of old red blood cells, and after being ""processed"" in the liver, it is excreted in the bile and removed from the body through the stool.  This normal process may be disrupted for a number of reasons; elevated bilirubin levels lead to neonatal jaundice. In addition to jaundice, the baby sometimes experiences drowsiness or difficulty feeding, and the urine is darker.</p>

<h2><strong>Causes of jaundice</strong></h2>

<p>Physiological neonatal jaundice occurs because the immature liver is not able to process and excrete bilirubin. It is usually noticed on the second or third day that the baby's face and eye whites are yellowish. Jaundice starts from the newborn's head/face, and if the levels increase, it can be seen on the trunk and extremities. If only the baby's face is yellow, bilirubin levels are certainly significantly lower than if the trunk and legs are yellow.</p>

<p>Breastmilk jaundice occurs due to the presence of inhibitory substances in milk that temporarily disrupt the metabolism and excretion of bilirubin. It usually occurs a few days after birth, does not harm the baby and passes spontaneously, although it can last for several weeks. It is not necessary or recommended to stop breastfeeding during this time!</p>

<p>Jaundice due to blood type mismatch between the mother and child (hemolytic disease of the newborn) is accompanied by other laboratory indicators and requires treatment.</p>

<p>Rare causes of jaundice are infection in the newborn, congenital metabolic disorders or abnormalities of the biliary tract. These are serious, but fortunately extremely rare conditions. Neonatal jaundice is sometimes mistaken for infectious hepatitis, most often caused by viruses, which is extremely rare in newborns.</p>

<h2>Is jaundice common in newborns?</h2>

<p>About 20% of term babies and 50%, even up to 80% of preterm babies turn yellow two or three days after birth. Most of them are completely healthy and do not require any treatment, and jaundice recedes spontaneously.</p>

<h2>What are the risk factors for jaundice?</h2>

<p>Preterm birth, birth injuries (cephalohematoma, pronounced suffusions - hemorrhages on the face or other body parts), neonatal jaundice in an older sibling. There is also an increased risk in children who suffered from oxygen deprivation at birth or have an infection.</p>

<h2>Measurement of bilirubin concentration</h2>

<p>The measurement is performed from the newborn's serum/blood or through the skin. Transcutaneous measurement, although there are some limitations, is a far more practical measurement method, painless for babies, and gives reliable results in children who have not received phototherapy. When the values are significantly elevated or the child has other symptoms, additional laboratory tests are performed.</p>

<h2>Why is jaundice treated if it is physiological?</h2>

<p>Although neonatal jaundice is most often physiologically caused, values are sometimes so elevated that they pose a potential risk to the newborn and require treatment.  Phototherapy effectively lowers bilirubin levels and is safe for the newborn. If the bilirubin levels are very high and accompanied by other disorders, the necessary treatment is applied.</p>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

<p>Breastfeeding is the most important preventive measure! Breastmilk not only provides the newborn with enough fluids and energy, but also accelerates the ""processing"" of bilirubin in the liver, owing to its composition. Colostrum stimulates bowel movement and the colonization of the large intestine with desirable probiotic bacteria, which also prevents the occurrence of jaundice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving water or glucose to a newborn who is not dehydrated will not prevent or alleviate jaundice. Never ""sunbathe"" your baby! Sunlight is not effective in treating jaundice and can be harmful and dangerous for the newborn's delicate skin.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Does the baby need supervision due to jaundice after discharge from the maternity hospital?</h2>

<p>If a newborn has any of the risk factors or bilirubin is at the limit values on discharge from the maternity hospital, further monitoring is required. Find out if you can come for a check-up at the maternity hospital, or where the baby will be followed up if the need arises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should take the child for a check-up if you notice that he/she is more yellow, especially if he/she suckles less, is sleepy and passive, the urine becomes darker or the stool is pale and colorless.</p>

4651,Fear of bathing,"<p>""Newborn babies sometimes don't like to bathe. Slightly older children may be afraid of bathing. It is, therefore, important that the newborn is introduced to bathing slowly, gently, as an opportunity to enjoy and relax. Play, let the water caress the baby's body, allow the baby to feel those light touches of water and the ripples that form as you slowly bubble the water around the baby. Offer a variety of games to relax, enjoy with your baby and encourage pleasant feelings. Always be careful and carefully monitor how your baby behaves and plays while bathing. ""</p>","<h2><strong>How does the fear of bathing arise?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>A newborn baby may be afraid of losing control.</li>
	<li>Slightly older babies/children may be frightened by the sound of water, their hair and head getting wet, being wiped/rubbed with a towel after bathing</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to prevent discomfort and fear of bathing:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Follow the baby's cues carefully and don't push it if you see that the baby feels insecure</li>
	<li>Provide a sense of security:
	<ul>
		<li>choose a smaller tub and don’t pour too much water in the beginning</li>
		<li>adjust water temperature,</li>
		<li>support the back of his/her neck and head, keep eye contact</li>
		<li>gradually introduce skin contact with water, wait for the baby to feel and accept the warmth,  </li>
		<li>massage/wash the tummy to keep the body warm</li>
		<li>do not pour water over his/her face and nose, but rather wash them with your hand</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Talk to the baby, sing, pour water over his/her body with light movements  </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What if the baby outgrows the tub?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Gradually introduce independent sitting in a larger tub - water should be added slowly.</li>
	<li>Put the tub in a large tub (shower unit), let the child get used to the new sizes.</li>
	<li>Bathe together with the child, put the child on your lap or between your legs to make him/her feel safe.</li>
	<li>Stick rubber stickers on the bottom of the tub to prevent slipping.</li>
	<li>Take the child out of the bathtub/even out of the bathroom before spilling water, so that he/she is not frightened by the noise created by spilling water.</li>
	<li>If the child is afraid that shampoo will get into his/her eyes, wash his/her head carefully and put protection over his eyes (your other palm or a plastic splash guard) or use baby shampoo that will not hurt his/her eyes.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Make bathing fun, play together!</strong></h2>

<p>You can reduce or eliminate the fear of bathing if you make bathing fun for the child and for you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Get special toys for water games (natural water colors, toys for spraying, pouring, immersion). Let your toddler choose a new bubble bath or a special toy.</li>
	<li>Bathing with siblings especially fun; playing and enjoying the play together will reduce the fear of bathing.</li>
	<li>Let bathing be your time together. Sing, tell stories...</li>
	<li>Bathing is an opportunity for the child to bathe his/her favorite toys or dolls. It helps to understand the meaning and importance of bathing.</li>
	<li>The child can choose the scent and smoothness of the cream to be applied on the skin after bathing, or the color or pattern of the towel.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Change the bathing time during the day. Discover the part of the day when your child likes to bathe most.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Never leave the bathroom while your baby/young child is bathing.</strong> Children easily slip under the water. Make sure you bring everything you need before you put your child in the bathtub.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Praise and encourage all of the child's independent actions towards bathing. If the time for bathing is full of positive feelings, useful, cheerful and fulfilled, the fear will surely decrease and eventually disappear.</p>

4656,Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B is rare in countries where children are routinely immunised against it. Hepatitis B symptoms include tiredness, appetite loss, fever, jaundice, aching joints and rash. Hepatitis B spreads through blood-to-blood contact. See your doctor if your child has symptoms of hepatitis B.","<h1>About hepatitis B</h1>

<p>Hepatitis B is caused by a virus. If you get infected with this virus, the virus travels through your blood to your liver, where it causes inflammation.</p>

<p>Hepatitis B is more common in  in developing countries that don’t have immunisation programs. If you aren’t immunised and travel to these places, you can be at risk of getting hepatitis B.</p>

<h2>How hepatitis B spreads</h2>

<p>Hepatitis B spreads through <strong>blood-to-blood contact</strong> – that is, when people come into contact with the blood of someone who has the virus.</p>

<p>This can happen if you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>share needles during drug use</li>
	<li>come into contact with a discarded needle</li>
	<li>get a tattoo or body-piercing with a dirty needle</li>
	<li>share toothbrushes, razors or other things like that</li>
	<li>have sex without using condoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because hepatitis B is passed on through blood-to-blood contact, it’s also possible for a pregnant woman to pass the virus onto her baby during pregnancy, almost always around the time of birth. Usually these women have chronic hepatitis B without symtoms.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis B symptoms</h2>

<p>The hepatitis B virus usually infects people a few months before any symptoms appear.</p>

<p>Children with hepatitis B can have very few obvious symptoms. They might have no symptoms at all, which sometimes makes hepatitis B hard to diagnose.</p>

<p>When there are symptoms, they might come on gradually and include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>loss of appetite and energy</li>
	<li>stomach pain (especially over the upper right side where the liver is) and vomiting</li>
	<li>fever</li>
	<li>jaundice</li>
	<li>rash</li>
	<li>dark urine and changes in poo colour</li>
	<li>painful or swollen joints.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about hepatitis B?</h2>

<p>If your child has any of the above symptoms, or if you think you or your child might have come into contact with the hepatitis B virus, see your doctor.</p>

<h2>Tests for hepatitis B</h2>

<p>If the docto thinks that your child’s symptoms might be caused by hepatitis B, your child will need blood tests to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Sometimes children need ultrasounds of their livers.</p>

<h2>Complications and treatment for hepatitis B</h2>

<p>Some children will get over the virus without treatment. But younger children are much more likely than adults to develop chronic hepatitis B – that is, to carry the virus for a long time. This can put them at risk of future liver failure and liver cancer.</p>

<p>There are some special anti-viral medications for chronic hepatitis B. Health professionals might consider prescribing them for older children and teenagers, especially when it looks like the child might have liver damage.</p>

<p>If your child’s symptoms are severe, she might need to be admitted to hospital. This is quite unusual.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis B prevention: immunisation</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid hepatitis B is to have your child immunised. If the vaccine is included in the routine immunization programme it is given soon after birth and 2 additional doses at the next several months.</p>

<h2>Hepatitis B prevention: pregnancy and breastfeeding</h2>

<p>If a pregnant woman has hepatitis B, she might be given medicine to reduce the chance of passing the virus on to her baby. At birth, the baby might also get a special injection of antibodies against hepatitis B, as well as the standard hepatitis B immunisation.</p>

<p>Women who have hepatitis B can safely breastfeed unless their nipples are cracked or bleeding.</p>

<h2>Extra hepatitis B prevention measures for all children and teenagers</h2>

<p>Hepatitis B can also be transmitted through exposure to infected blood.</p>

<p>If your child comes into contact with a <strong>used needle</strong>, use soap and water to wash your child’s skin where the contact happened. Then see your doctor . The risk of getting hepatitis B from this kind of contact is very low.</p>

<p>Your child <strong>should not share toothbrushes, razors or other items</strong> that belong to someone who has hepatitis B, because these things might be contaminated with infected blood.</p>",8541,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"396, 536, 131, 126, 136","4661, 4666, 5596",1,0,"<ol>

""","<p>Hepatitis B vaccine contains highly purified non-infectious particles of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HbsAg), and also contains: aluminum salts that serve as an adsorbent and adjuvants (an enhancer of the immune response).</p>

<p>The vaccine is given by injection into the thigh muscle in infants or the deltoid muscle (upper arm) in older children (older than 3 years). Children up to 15 years of age are given a dose of 0.5 ml and children 16 years of age and older receive a 1.0 ml dose for adults. Routine immunization is performed with three doses of vaccine:</p>

<p>1st dose - first day after birth (or chosen day)</p>

<p>2nd dose - 1 month after the first dose</p>

<p>3rd dose - 6 months after the first dose</p>

<p>It is important to test pregnant women for hepatitis B. In case they carry the hepatitis B virus, the child receives specific antibodies (hepatitis B immunoglobulin) on the first day after birth, in addition to the vaccine.</p>

<p>If all the above measures are applied, the mother who carries the hepatitis B virus can breastfeed her child, except in situations when the nipples are cracked and bleeding, when there is a short break until recovery.</p>

4671,Tuberculosis,"""Tuberculosis is an infectious disease which most often affects the lungs, but it can also spread to other parts of the body.""","<h1>Tuberculosis</h1>

<p>Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease most often affects the lungs, but it can also spread to other parts of the body: kidneys, bones, brain, intestines, etc. when the symptoms and signs of the disease are related to the affected organ. One-third of the world's population carries this bacteria and has no symptoms of the disease (latent form). However, 10% of infected individuals will get sick at some point in their lives, when their resistance decreases.</p>

<p><strong>Source of infection</strong></p>

<p>The source of the infection is a sick person who: by sneezing, coughing and spitting, throws droplets with bacteria into the surrounding air when another person inhales it, becomes infected. It spreads quickly in poor and overcrowded areas so family members and close friends of an infected person are in a higher risk of getting the diseases. Risk factors for the development of the illness include environment factors, such as smoking, use of alcohol and drugs and immunodeficiency (such as in HIV/AIDS).</p>

<p><strong>Incubation period</strong></p>

<p>The disease can occur a few weeks after infection or years later.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms and signs of pulmonary tuberculosis are:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A cough that lasts for three or more weeks</li>
	<li>Coughing up blood or purulent sputum</li>
	<li>Chest pain when breathing and coughing</li>
	<li>Fatigue</li>
	<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Night sweats</li>
	<li>Loss of appetite</li>
	<li>Weight loss</li>
</ul>

<p>If these signs and symptoms of the disease occur in your child, it is necessary to consult a doctor, especially if the child has been in contact with a person suffering from tuberculosis.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of tuberculosis</strong></p>

<p>The disease is treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs, and the treatment is long-lasting. Children under the age of 2 are particularly susceptible and prone to severe, widespread forms of the disease, which are difficult to detect and treat, which can be fatal.</p>

<p><strong>Traetment of latent tuberculosis</strong></p>

<p>If a child or older persons was infected with tuberculosis following exposure to a person suffering from tuberculosis, many times he should be treated even if there are no symptoms to eradicated the bacteria and to prevent reactivation of the disease when the immunologic resistance decreses. Detection of prior infection is done by a skin test called Mantoux - tebuerculin skin test or  a blood test.  The skin test is performed by injecting a small amount of fluid into the skin on the lower part of the arm. A person given the tuberculin skin test must return within 48 to 72 hours to have a trained person look for a reaction on the arm. The result depends on the size of the raised, hard area or swelling.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>

<p>To protect infants from tuberculosis, live BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) vaccine is used for prevention. It is a weakened type of tuberculosis bacteria that causes infection of cows but not of humans. It is an important vaccine for babies since It may prevent most of the  brain infection and almost half of the lung complications with tuberculosis. Newborn babies receive this vaccine in the left upper arm before being discharged from the hospital. In case he/she did not receive it for some reason (delivery outside the maternity ward or other), it is necessary to administer the vaccine until the age of 2 months and no later than 12 months. </p>

<p>In the prevention of tuberculosis and its spread, the most crucial health measure is the vaccination of children, but also the early detection and treatment of infected persons.</p>",6426,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"126, 5221","4676, 4686, 4681",0,0,"<ol>

<ul>
	<li>The vaccine does not contain preservatives, antibiotics or adjuvants (enhancers of the immune response), but only traces of the substance used in the production process (lyophilization medium, gelatin and sucrose).</li>
	<li>Before the newborn leaves the maternity ward, usually on the second or third day after birth, he or she receives the BCG vaccine by injection into the skin of the left upper arm. In case that the baby  did not receive the vaccine for some reason (delivery outside the maternity hospital or other), it is necessary to organize the administration of the vaccine until the infant is two months old, and no later than the age of 12 months.</li>
	<li>It is expected that, at the place of vaccine administration, in the upper third of the left upper arm, after 3 to 4 weeks, a local reaction in the form of redness and hardening will occur, which will later soften and usually empty. In 2 to 5 months, it heals, leaving a scar that, after maturing, is whitish in color and a few millimeters in size. During this process, you may notice a slight swelling of the local lymph glands.</li>
	<li>The existing BCG vaccine is effective mainly against the severe forms of non-pulmonary tuberculosis such as: tuberculous infection of the brain and diffuse forms of the disease, but it is only partially effective  against pulmonary tuberculosis, especially in adults.</li>
	<li>The BCG vaccine may be given together with other vaccines only at a different injection site.</li>
	<li>Children who may have lower immunity (immunodeficiency), such as children born with HIV infection, or any other problems of the immune system should not receive this vaccine.</li>
	<li>Children who have not received the vaccine at birth and have diagnosed with tuberculosis  do not receive this vaccine.</li>
	<li>Children who have severe complications at birth receive the vaccine after recovery.</li>

4686,Why it is important for your child to be vaccinated,"Vaccination is a simple, safe and effective way to strengthen your child's immunity and create protection against serious infectious diseases.","<p>Vaccination is one of the most important components of the health of each of us. From the first days of life, the baby is protected by the vaccine from the risk of getting infectious diseases that exist around. The disability and mortality of young children have been dramatically reduced all over the world, thanks to vaccination. The situation that caught the world with the appearance of the Corona-virus and the Covid-19 infection that showed how important are vaccines for the community to fight against and overcome such powerful viruses that are spread with great ease and speed in the population, causing a world pandemic.</p>

<p>As long as infectious diseases exist somewhere in the world, and there are vaccines against them, it is important to protect your child with vaccination. It is also a good way to maintain collective immunity to existing infectious diseases and to have the ability to develop and produce new vaccines against new diseases that emerge and occur periodically.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of vaccination can be seen in the example of the fight against the smallpox virus, that once caused a severe, deadly disease. As a result of successfully implemented vaccination in the world, smallpox is a disease that no longer exists since 1980, when the need for further application of the vaccine against this disease ceased.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>What are vaccines?</strong> Vaccines are consisted of: dead or living but weakened pathogens (viruses or bacteria), their parts or altered particles of pathogens. They are designed to be harmless but to strongly stimulate your child's immune system to produce antibodies, and create protection, against these pathogens. These antibodies become your child's defences and are always ready to defend when the pathogens try to attack the body.</li>
	<li><strong>Immunization and vaccination</strong> Immunization is the process of providing protection for a child from certain infectious diseases. This protection can be provided actively, through vaccination but also passively, by administering ready-made protective factors, immunoglobulins containing specific antibodies (or monoclonal antibodies). Active vaccination provides protection for a long time while passive vaccination provides protection for a relatively short time (usually for only several weeks).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vaccination is the act of giving a vaccine</strong>. This procedure intentionally encourages the creation of antibodies, in your child, against a   pathogen (an agent like bacteria or virus that causes a disease) without suffering from the disease. It is performed: by injection (e.g, against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, etc.), through the mouth (against polio and rotavirus) and through the nasal mucosa (live flu vaccine). Some children, due to age or serious illness that weakened or permanently damaged immunity, will not be able to be vaccinated or will not be able to receive all vaccines. You can get update recommendations and advice from your doctor and in exceptional situations it is important to consult a pediatric immunologist.</li>
	<li><strong>Herd immunity</strong>:  Immunization will protect your child from certain infectious diseases, strengthen him or her, but will also prevent the further spread of the disease. Therefore, it is important that a sufficient number of people in the community acquire the necessary resistance, in order to slow down or completely stop the spread of bacteria and viruses as the cause of these diseases, and thus protect this vulnerable part of the population especially those that can not get vaccines.  This protection is called herd immunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order for your child to develop long term protection, he or she will need to receive additional  doses of the vaccine several times at different ages.</p>

<p>Do not forget to vaccinate your child against diseases that can be prevented by vaccination, because this strengthens his/her defense system and may save lives.</p>",9311,8,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"346, 126, 351","5596, 4686, 4691",0,0,"<p><strong>1.

In the first 12 months, the baby is especially interested in getting to know his environment.

Speak in a high or low tone, try whisper and singing. Do this alternately with the baby. Repeat the sounds s/he makes.  </p>

<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Place the baby face to face with you - the baby will watch you as you make those sounds. The baby in this position can watch you change your facial expression (big smile, outstretched tongue, wide eyes, raised eyebrows, puffy cheeks or blowing). Observe the baby and if you notice that some of these expressions scare them, quickly change your facial expression, and after a while try again with a softened facial expression. Remember that every baby is different and reacts in different ways.  In this game, keep an expression for a while to give your baby a chance to try to create a new facial expression by watching and imitating you. Repeat what the baby does. </p>

4711,"""Explore and find"" games","Babies are naturally curious about their environment and love to explore, mainly when they start crawling. Your baby will explore inside of the wardrobes and under the bed. When your baby does that, he/she imagines what he/she could find there and what can do with what he/she finds. At 5-6 months, the baby explores and expands her/his imagination, senses of touch and taste, which is why he/she puts everything in his mouth. At about this age, your child will also enjoy doing it together. At about seven months, your baby may imitate you when you make different or unusual sounds. At about eight months, your baby will begin to use her/his imagination to mimic what others do. She/He will start using a cube as a mobile phone or will start the game ""where are you - where are you"" by hiding his face behind the pillow.","<p><strong>What do you need:</strong> any favourite toys, diaper, scarf, paper towel, canvas bag or pouch, small plastic bottles, various seeds and small items.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Play hide and seek items. Allow your baby to see you hiding the object under a blanket, diaper or pillow. If the baby does not start to discover the hidden object, next time cover it partially. Help the baby find the item.</p>

<p>Loosely wrap a small toy in a paper towel or tissue (do not use tape). The child can unroll the package and find a surprise. You can also use some other soft paper or wrapping paper with cheerful colours that rustle. You can also wrap the toy in a thin napkin, cloth or a diaper. Another idea is to make a surprise bag that the child will find in the morning. Fill a paper bag or canvas bag with the following items or other similar items that you may have: a stuffed toy, something that makes a sound, a small plastic jar with a screw cap or a book with cardboard pages. Encourage your baby to explore the ""magic bag"".  Make sure items are safe, and supervise well.</p>

<p>Another idea is to play ""pretend games"" with a stuffed toy or a doll. Show and tell the child what the doll is doing (walking, going to sleep, eating, playing at the table). Use words to describe what the doll is doing, maybe give the doll a voice--anything that is fun for you and your chld.  Give the child that toy and see if he will move the doll and do what you do.  You can take turns if your child enjoys that game!</p>

<p>Children like to play with objects that produce sounds and make noise. If you have time and have the materials, you could make a more complex rattle by stringing  metal bracelets wide enough to fit over the baby's hand.  You could also fill small plastic bottles (with lids that children cannot open) with objects that sound different, e.g. marbles, rice, salt, grains of corn, etc.  If you do this, be sure to close the lids tightly for safety, and encourage the child to explore the sounds.</p>

<p><strong>When can you use these activities:</strong>  When you have some free time, use it for simple play with your child.  If there are older siblings, encourage them to play in a similar manner with the youngest member of the family.  </p>",9246,55,"45,46",59,60,,,0,0,"<p><a href=""https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Preporuke-roditeljima-dece-od-3.-do-4.-meseca.pdf"">https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Preporuke-roditeljima-dece-od-3.-do-4.-meseca.pdf</a><a href=""https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Preporuke-roditeljima-dece-od-5.-do-6.-meseca.pdf"">https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Preporuke-roditeljima-dece-od-5.-do-6.-meseca.pdf</a></p>

4716,Floor games,"In the first year, babies learn to raise their head, roll over, sit, crawl, stand and eventually, walk. Play is an excellent way for a baby to move and develop motor skills. Tummy time helps babies build the strength they need to crawl and pull up. Movement and physical activity are vital for the growth and overall development of the child. Physical activities shape not only motor development but also significantly affect all other aspects of development. That's why it's essential to focus on making physical activities fun for the baby. If children enjoy what they do, they will increasingly want to repeat those experiences. And the movement and physical activities that children enjoy increase their self-confidence and build motor skills and talent.","<p><strong>You will need: </strong>a floor mat or blanket, baby's favourite toys, rattles.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it: </strong>Position the baby so that you can touch her feet. Gently play with his/her feet and toes and gently tickle him/her. Touch the baby's finger one by one and at the same time say, ""This finger is… little thumb/mom's finger/dad's finger"" for each finger. While the baby is on her/his back, place a wind-up toy that produces sound (if you have one) next to or behind the baby. Check if the baby is looking for the source of the sound.  Or gently shake a rattle or jar with beans and see if the baby looks for it.</p>

<p>On a soft flat surface, e.g. on the bed or blanket, while lying on her back, gently tap or massage the baby's hands and fingers as you talk with her--for example ""Here is your hand; here are your fingers,"" telling her what you are doing. Or you could sing a gentle song as you stroke her hands.  Another idea is to use a simple toy that you place where the baby can see it, but where she cannot reach it.  Does she try?  You might move the toy as the baby looks at it.  As the baby gets older, you could encourage your baby to roll over to reach for the toy.</p>

<p>There are so many ideas for ""floor time"" as your baby grows!  Place a blanket or a towel on the carpet, put the baby on his/her tummy so that his/her head is turned to one side. Lie next to the baby to encourage her. The baby can stay in this position as long as s/he likes it, but make sure that his/her head is turned to the left and the right side for about the same length of time. Again, you can put a favourite toys or objects in front of the baby, but so that they are just a little out of the baby's reach. As your baby gets older, encourage your baby to try to reach them and move in their direction.</p>

<p>""Tummy time"" is important for physical development.  Make sure the time your baby spends on his/her tummy is a little longer each day. Observe your baby, so you can gently move the baby if s/he turns his face directly to the floor, as this can make breathing difficult. As s/he gets stronger over time, the baby will be able to raise her head and rise a little by pushing with her hands.  These motions will will later grow into rolling and crawling.</p>

<p>Finally, sometimes you can use ""floor time"" to gently shake a rattle or other sounding toy. Put it in the baby's hands. Encourage the baby to keep it in his hand, even for a short time. A rattle or other toy that you put in your baby's hand should be relatively light and not too long. You can also firmly attach the favourite toy next to the baby's crib, swing or cradle so that the baby can reach for it. Change the toy regularly to allow your baby to watch and do new things.</p>

<p><strong>When can you use these activities:</strong> whenever you can find free time to play. There are numerous opportunities every day during daily routines. Routines such as changing clothes, preparing for a meal, or needing to help the baby to wait for something (when you are not able to meet the baby’s need immediately), are also excellent opportunities to use simple games to create a positive, enjoyable environment even if there are everyday inconveniences.</p>",446,55,"43,44,45,46",59,60,,,0,0,"<p><a href=""https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Preporuke-roditeljima-dece-od-3.-do-4.-meseca.pdf"">https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Preporuke-roditeljima-dece-od-3.-do-4.-meseca.pdf</a></p>

4731,"Mirror Games: ""Nobody Like Me""","Play provides babies with different sensory, physical and cognitive experiences. Experiences build connections in the brain, which helps babies develop physically, cognitively, socially and emotionally. That's why to play, experts say, is like ""fireworks"" in the brain - it establishes new neural connections and activates existing ones. One of the fireworks stops when the baby discovers her/himself. At about the fifth month, the baby becomes fascinated with her/himself, and that is why she/he likes to look in the mirror and watch how his/her facial expressions changes. Mirrors are therefore very interesting for babies of this age. The baby will still not understand now that the baby watching him/her from the mirror is him/she, that understanding develops in later periods, but that does not stop you from offering games to the mirrors as a source of fascination and stimulation.

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Allow the baby to see herself or himself  in the mirror. Place an unbreakable mirror next to the baby's crib or changing chair so the baby can see herself or himself on it. Start talking and tap the mirror to get her to look at it. Say ""Look, there is [your baby's name]""  After a while, the baby will realize that it is her/his reflection. Allow the baby to tap on the mirror and point the finger at himself in the mirror.</p>

<p>Look in the mirror together with your baby—smile and wave to him in the mirror. Smile and make funny facial expressions together as you look yourselves in the mirror. With lipstick or crayon, circle the place where your baby is reflected on the large mirror, encourage her to touch that place with her fingers and to stain the mirror with the hand, to explore and realize the changes. Follow everything the baby does with positive and encouraging comments, sounds, talk to the baby about what she is doing, what is happening, who is in the mirror, repeat the baby's name and point to her face in the mirror. Repeat the same with your character in the mirror. Point to yourself, name it - it's mom ... this is ... (repeat the child's name).  As your baby gets older, you will see her begin to recognize her name.  Use it often.</p>

<p>In front of the mirror, you can also play hide-and-seek games or ""where is [baby's name]?"" with the baby. He will always light up and smile when he sees himself and/or you again behind the scarf you are removing.</p>

<p>When the baby starts rolling or crawling on his tummy, play the ""come and get me"" game. Let the baby move a little, and you follow her and hug her when you catch her.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Carefully hold the baby and gently sway and swing to the music (sing by yourself or play music on the radio or on your phone). You can move slowly around the room with the baby in your arms. If you can, play or sing different music, so you will encourage your baby to listen carefully.  As she gets older, she will begin to identify different kinds of sound and music (choose what you and your family enjoy, including traditional music, songs, and chants).  What seem to be your baby's favorite kinds of music?</p>

<p>At naptime or bedtime, you might hold the baby and gently rock her while singing a lullaby. Sing to the baby (even if you can't sing well--she won't know and will love hearing your voice!). Repeating songs and lullabies calms the baby because s/he hears a familiar voice, and at the same time, it helps the baby to learn and listen.  Traditional lullabies connect her to your culture and community.</p>

<p>Another way to introduce the baby to sounds is to use some everyday household items that can make noise.  For example, measuring. spoons and cups for measuring ingredients have interesting shapes and can make interesting sounds. Gently move and shake a few measuring spoons or cups at a distance your baby can reach with his hands (or feet). Then give them to the baby to hold, study and shake. You can use them to create rhythm and melody and watch your baby follow the changes.</p>

<p>Make a rattle from bells, tokens, or bottle caps. Offer the baby one, and then another rattle, so that s/he holds one rattle in each hand. If s/he has both in her hand, help her shake them. Try to see if she likes one of those sounds more than the other.</p>

<p>Here is another idea:  If the baby has started to sit on her own, hold the baby on your knees facing you. Move your knees up and down to the rhythm of a children's song or other traditional music. Sing and move following the rhythm. Help the baby to join his palms and clap in rhythm.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it</strong>:  Starting when your baby is just a few months old, quietly talk to the baby while feeding her, changing her diapers, holding her in your arms or when she is next to you on the mat, or in the stroller. Although she does not understand all the words, even as a newborn the baby recognizes your voice, and it will please her. When you see your baby reacting to your voice, respond with warm smiles, caress her, etc.  If she doesn't respond, keep trying!  She'll begin to respond.</p>

<p>Read simple baby books or other reading material from day one. Even if s/he do not understand the story, the baby will enjoy your closeness and your voice.

It is how they get to know their senses, the sounds of nature and the things around them. Everything he can hear becomes the joy of surprise and discovery for the child. In the second year, the child will already recognize that the dog is barking, the bird is chirping, the engine is humming, that the lullaby is a sign to go to sleep.","<p><strong>You will need:</strong> music devices, rattles, household items, your palms, your voice.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Music, songs, gently tapping, massaging and cuddling your baby while singing or ringing/rattling - these activities encourage hearing development and movement. Turn on the radio or stereo. Encourage your child to play and jump in rhythm. If he can stand with your help, hold hands and dance as partners. Your baby can now sing to music .... a-a-a-a-a! He will imitate your singing the way he can. It is important to support her in that and to spend time with music every day.</p>

<p>In the second year, your child can already play with toy instruments. Organize a small orchestra and make music. Show your child how to produce loud and quiet sounds, how to go from subtle to audible, and how to go from loud to soft. Vary the rhythm, following your child's capacity to mimic the rhythm shown. Don't rush, follow the child, strive for harmony because music is just that.</p>

<p>Keep your baby away from loud, surprising and frightening sounds. If your child happens to be exposed to such sounds, he cries, is upset, scared, immediately take the child in your arms and lean him/her on your chest. The rhythm and sound of your heart will bring security and calm the child. Your calmness is most important at that moment.</p>

As children grow, so does the way they play. Play is a key activity for your child's learning and development. When your child plays, they get a lot of different ways and times to learn. Your child will love to play with you, but sometimes they will prefer to play alone. Sometimes they will only want ideas and information from you about how the game is progressing. And sometimes they may want to play with other children - without you adults!","<p><strong>You will need</strong>: cardboard boxes, toys of various shapes and types, clips, ping-pong balls ...</p>

<p><strong>How to do it</strong>: A child in the second year slowly realizes that adults can be of help to him! When a child ""asks"" for something by making a sound or pointing a finger, react. Name the subject the child is looking for and encourage him or her to communicate again. Communicate alternately - that's how you'll have a ""conversation"". The game of showing and naming is fun when you show what the child is interested in.</p>

<p><strong>Play naming games using the ""Magic Box""</strong>: in one colorful box with a hole on the side, through which you can pull your hand, place various toys that the child loves, they are familiar to him. Put your hand in and pull out the toy. The child will be surprised and happy, and you name the toy and encourage the child to name or show ... ""where is the teddy bear?"" The child shows the teddy bear in your hand ... ""where did the mother find the teddy bear?"" ... the child shows on the box .... Then try to insert your hand together with your child's hand in the box and pull out the next toy. Ask the same questions ... repeat while the child is interested.  </p>

<p>Make a simple toy by cutting a round hole in the lid of a cardboard box. Give the baby clips or ping-pong balls to put in the box and show how to take them out. Or let the child rejoice when you spill them out of the box. If the baby crawls or learns to walk or walk already, he will be happy to help you collect and insert them again. </p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Make a simple insert by arranging cubes or ping-pong balls in a baking tray or a cardboard egg box. Use primary colours (blue, yellow, red, green) to make the game more interesting. Encourage the child to insert cubes of the same shade/balls / larger bottle caps in the colour-coded openings (red to red openings, etc.).</p>

4771,I play and learn to walk,"Young children like to do the same things all the time. It's good to repeat. In this way, they practice skills that enable them to master a challenge. On the other hand, mastering new things gives them self-confidence, and they also get a sense of competence. The more children practice and acquire new skills, the more likely they are to accept new challenges that encourage learning.","<p>Arrange the furniture so that the child can move around the room and walk between individual soft pieces of furniture, while holding on to the pieces of furniture. This encourages maintaining balance while walking.<br />
To encourage the child to take the first steps, when he is in a standing position and facing another person, encourage him to step towards that other person who is calling him holding a favorite toy or other object (sometimes the person himself is a sufficient motive).</p>

<p>Children enjoy toys that are pushed and pulled. If you don't already have one, make a simple toy that is pulled by passing a piece of wool or a thicker knitting thread or a soft rope (about 60 cm long) through a box or a thread spool. Tie a ball or a plastic string at the other end to serve as a handle. </p>

<p>A large box can be a great place to sit and play. Children love to use large packaging as new small spaces in which they can fit and enjoy. Encourage the child to enter, get out of the box, or to sit in it... Make a bridge or a tunnel out of the box so that he can pass through it to the other side, where you or your favorite toy are waiting for him.<br />
Create a terrain with some obstacles in the room with the help of boxes, small mats, pillows or pieces of soft furniture so that the child can move overcoming those obstacles, to roll over or to cross them, go under and through them.</p>

<p>The child learns that different toys ""do"" different things. Let him play with a variety of things that he can roll, push, pull, hug, shake, press, turn, stack, spin and mix. Most children enjoy listening to music. Encourage the child to move forward, around and backwards with the music, because that is how he exercises balance. If necessary, help him by holding his hands.  All of this supports her new walking skills.</p>

<p>When can you engage in these activities? When a child is starting to walk, he is so motivated to master this skill that he will expect you to dedicate every free moment of your life to support him in mastering this so important life function.  You don't have to do this, but do create the environment she is looking for!</p>",9251,55,"49,50",59,60,"5601, 5636",,0,0,"<p><a href=""https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Igra.pdf"">https://www.unicef.org/serbia/sites/unicef.org.serbia/files/2018-07/Igra.pdf</a></p>",en,published

<p>Play the game ""What is it?"" By pointing to parts of clothes, toys, body parts, objects or pictures and asking the child to name them. If the child does not answer the question, you name the subject instead and encourage the child to imitate what you said.  Make this fun, not a test.</p>

<p>Create a picture book by putting plain, simple pictures cut from magazines into a photo album. The child will also enjoy looking at his/her photos and photos of family members. Pictures of pets are also a favorite with children of this age. </p>

Children use imagination and creativity to explore the world and their place in it, understand themselves and other people, explore and express feelings, and try out different ideas and ways to solve problems.</p>","<p><strong>You will need</strong> different colours and papers, coloured chalk, brushes, sponges, fingers and palms.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong> children are always interested in ""artistic activities"". Use large non-toxic wax crayons and a large block of drawing paper (the lower the age, the larger the drawing area required due to imperfect movements). Glue a large piece of drawing paper to a table or floor, to a tidy or drawing board (whatever you have available). Have a child draw on one piece of paper while you draw on another piece of paper or alternately draw on the same paper. Show your child how to use large non-toxic wax crayons. You can also paint with watercolours using large brushes, sponges or palms and feet.</p>

<p>Allow the child to ""paint with water"" in the open, in the yard in front of the house/building. Give the child a large, broad brush and a bowl or bucket of clean water. They will have fun ""painting"" on a pre-prepared surface - on a wall, on the facade of a house, fence or terrace, on a concrete path, on a basketball court. For this purpose, various water sprinklers are suitable, which children play within the summer, and in the winter, they can paint with water.</p>

<p>Together, make a ""slimy"" mixture of water and density (starch powder used for cooking) by placing the ingredients in a bowl, slowly adding water, and mixing it with your fingers to the desired thickness. If you add food colouring, you can use it to paint with your fingers on large paper or nylon, outside on the trails and concrete terrains, and your child will enjoy this harmless and safe game of soiling and painting.</p>

<p>Children of this age like to draw with coloured chalks, and large chalks are more suitable for drawing outside, on concrete or wall surfaces. Smaller chalks are more suitable for drawing inside. Indoors, offer the child to use a part of the wall that you painted with dark oil paint (they are available in paints - black, green, navy blue, they move the wall surfaces) and prepare it as a drawing board on the wall of the room or hallway. You can cover part of the wall with wrapping paper (at least as far as the child can spread his arms - in width and as much as he can raise his arm - in height). The child has to draw on vertical and horizontal surfaces because, in that way, he uses different angles of perception and forms different perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it: </strong>Make a book by pasting materials of different textures on each page. Materials such as fine sandpaper, feathers, cotton balls, nylon, silk and buttons are suitable for learning words such as ""rough"", ""smooth"", ""hard"" and ""soft"".

Zdrava deca u zavisnosti od mesta istraživanja , u različitom procentu (27% u razvijenim i do 85% u zemljama u razvoju) mogu ovu bakteriju nositi na sluznici gornjih disajnih puteva.U promenjenim okolnostima, događa se lokalni razvoj infekcije, a putem krvotoka infekcija se može proširiti i na druge delove tela.  
Inficirane osobe bekteriju prenose na druge osobe preko kapljica ili direktnim kontaktom, ređe indirektno, preko sveže zaprljanog predmeta.""","<p><strong>Signs and symptoms of the disease</strong></p>

<p>The bacteria Streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococcus) can cause bacterial inflammation of the pharynx, ears and sinuses, but also serious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis, and other less frquent complications. The infections are more ferquent in children younger than 2 years but may appear laso in older children especially in high risk groups that include children with chronic diseases and children with weakened immune system. </p>

<p>Pneumonia may occur as a complication of the flu or other viruses, appears suddenly and includes: fever, cough with purulent secretions, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, insomnia. In 10% -20% of cases it occurs in association with sepsis, and the disease may be potenially fatal if not treated.</p>

<p>Streptococcus pneumonia is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis (inflammation of the meninges) in children. Sick children show weakness, irritability, vomiting, fever,  headache, convulsions and coma may occur. About  8% of sick children die despite treatment, and many children who develop the disease remain with permanent neurological disorders such as hearing loss, mental retardation, motor disorders, convulsions.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>

<p>Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumonia are treated with combination of antibiotics to overcome the increase in resistance of this bacteria to antibiotics. The increasesing resistance has complicated the treatment and the outcome of these infections.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>

<p>The best protection against infections caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumonia is vaccination. Other measures can also help: breastfeeding the infant, prevention of influenza by vaccination, protecting the child from the effects of tobacco smoke and other air pollutants, arranging hygienic conditions, etc.</p>

<p>There are two types of vaccines: conjugated and polysaccharide. In the conjugate vaccine, the polysaccharide part of the bacterial envelope is bound to the protein, and they are intended especially for children younger than 2 years of age. Two conjugated vaccines, Prevenar 13 (containing antigens of 13 strains of pneumococcus) and Synflorix (containing antigens of 10 strains of pneumococcus), are used. The polysaccharide vaccine (Pneumo 23) is intended for use in children older than 2 years who are in  with high risk of infection. </p>

<p>Vaccination against the disease caused by Streptococcus pneumonia is given in three doses starting at 6 weeks of life, it is followed by the second and third doses in intervals of 4-8 weeks.

	<li>By the end of the third year, most children have 20 baby teeth.    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Teeth eruption</h2>

<ul>
	<li>While the teeth erupt through the gums, babies are especially sensitive. They need to constantly rub their gums with something, and the place where the teeth erupt is sometimes slightly red and swollen.</li>
	<li>Some children's teeth erupt imperceptibly, but in most children, parents notice certain behavioral changes: they cry or get cranky more, they do not eat normally; they drool, have difficulty falling asleep and wake up more often at night, they chew on everything they can get their hands on: toys, bibs; they ask for a pacifier, get their diapers dirty more often; they rub the ear on the side of the erupting tooth.</li>
	<li>These changes may be a normal part of development, but are sometimes the result of mild infections.</li>

4826,How to protect teeth from decay (caries),"<p>Teeth are protected from decay by good care, proper nutrition and regular dental check-ups. When the first stain on the teeth appears that cannot be removed by regular cleaning, visit a pediatric dentist.</p>","<h2><strong>What is tooth decay (caries) </strong></h2>

<p>Tooth decay can occur very early as a result of inadequate oral hygiene and poor nutrition. The early appearance of decay on a large number of teeth, most often in the upper jaw, is known as circular caries and is also called ""baby bottle syndrome"". A tooth begins to decay when a sticky deposit called plaque forms on its surface. In it, microorganisms feed on sugars from food and create acid that corrodes the tooth. On the tooth surface, brown spots or a white band along the gum line begin to be noticed, and over an extended period of time, a cavity appears on the tooth. The surrounding gums can be red and swollen, and in severe cases, covered in blisters. Such a chronically inflamed tooth can cause pain and spread the infection, affect nutrition, speech, jaw development and the child's overall growth and development.  </p>

<p>At first signs of tooth decay, it is necessary to take the child to a pediatric dentist for an examination and necessary treatment. Postponing the visit can lead to numerous problems: pain and discomfort, risk of decay of neighboring teeth, increased anxiety during the next dental visit, speech disorders, orthodontic problems, etc.</p>

<h2><strong>Protecting teeth from caries</strong></h2>

<p>In order to prevent tooth decay, it is necessary to apply the following measures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Regular brushing from the moment the first tooth erupts</li>
	<li>Initially, cleaning the teeth with damp cotton gauze or an age-appropriate brush</li>
	<li>Teeth are cleaned twice a day, preferably after the morning and evening meal, and from the second year, a low-fluoride toothpaste is used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Proper nutrition</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Provide conditions for the child to develop healthy eating habits and use foods without added sugar or with a low content of natural sugars.</li>
	<li>The best food in the first 6 months is breastmilk, which continues to be given with the gradual introduction of other foods in the diet. Then you can offer a little water between meals.</li>
	<li>Do not put the baby to sleep with the bottle in his/her mouth. Teach him/her how to use a cup to drink fluids; you can start already in the first year, when he/she masters the skill of grasping with two hands.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Healthy eating habits</h2>

<p>In order to develop healthy eating habits in your child, you need to make sure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>that the child has a permanent place to eat at home, eats at about the same time, eats food that is easy to chew and stays in the mouth briefly, that food is removed from the table after a meal </li>
	<li>that, when thirsty, the child is given water, rather than sweetened drinks; if you give the child juice, it should be as part of a meal</li>
	<li>foods that are good for the teeth are those that encourage chewing and salivation: cheese, chopped vegetables - carrots, celery </li>
	<li>that you visit the dentist regularly:<em> </em>once or twice a year<em>,</em> even when all of your child's teeth seem healthy</li>
	<li>you know how much healthy teeth contribute to your child's confident smile</li>

Take your child to the dentist regularly once to twice a year, and more often if necessary.</p>","<p>Visits to the dentist should be regular. The first visit is planned at the age of 6 months, and subsequently once or twice a year. During the visit, the dentist will examine your child's mouth and teeth, and also talk to you about the care and protection of the teeth and possible risks that can lead to their decay. In accordance with the child's age, the dentist will: </p>

<ul>
	<li>demonstrate a procedure or perform the planned procedures: clean the deposits and apply fluoride preparations for additional protection;</li>
	<li>in case tooth decay is detected, you will make an appointment for treatment. If possible, it is best to do it in the morning, when the child has slept well and is rested.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before visiting the dental office, it is good to talk to the child about what to expect, so that he/she does not face an entirely unknown situation and additional fear:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Try to keep that conversation relaxed and hint at the upcoming visit as an interesting experience.</li>
	<li> Use expressions that will make it easier for the child to understand: that the dentist will: ""take a picture of his/her teeth"", ""count"" and maybe ""brush"" them.</li>
	<li>Playing ""dentist"" at home will make it easier for him/her to understand what is happening. First you play the dentist and count and brush his/her teeth, and then switch roles.</li>
	<li>It will be easier for him/her to accept the intervention when you present tooth decay as a ""worm"", and tooth repair as a ""special cleaning or a bee"". It can be especially interesting if you suggest that he/she may get a ""star"" in a color of his/her choice. Avoid words such as: pain, drilling, needle that will upset and scare your child.</li>
	<li>Read your child educational stories about going to the dentist, look at pictures, maybe even a suitable clip.</li>
</ul>

<p>After visiting the dental office, be sure to talk to the child about how it was at the ""examination"". Make sure you set a good example to your child, both in daily dental care and in regular visits to the dentist.</p>

4841,Stimulation of motor activities in the second year,"""The moment when a child gets to his feet and starts to walk on his own is one of the strongest experiences. He never seems to get tired.

<ul>
	<li>It is expected that a healthy child will start walking in the period between 18th and 20th month.</li>
	<li>The first steps a child takes are on a broad basis. The feet are mostly apart and facing outwards.</li>
	<li>The feet will always be positioned in a way that provides the body with the most stable position - do not try to correct the position of the feet.</li>
	<li>Do not put shoes on the child for walking around the house - the shoe does not form an arch of the foot, it is rather strengthened through activity. It can happen that when a child puts on shoes and stands up on his feet stops, that he sits down immediately, because he does not understand the information coming from the surface.</li>
	<li>During the period in which a child stabilizes its walk, the arms are generally raised high in order to maintain balance.</li>
	<li>Very often, a child carries toys in each hand or one larger one, which gives him better stability when walking. When he drops a toy, he is sure to sit down.</li>
	<li>Even after a child starts to walking, he will often use, on different surfaces, forms of bawling, crawling, because they help him get to what he wants faster and safer. </li>
</ul>

	<li>A child who is walking will be sure to raise his leg and try to climb the stairs, or pieces of furniture.</li>

	<li>S/he carries bottles, baskets, balls, mostly heavier things that give him a feeling of extra security.</li>

There is a saying: ""Your hands are a reflection of your brain"". The hand is used for research, manipulating objects, activities of daily life.</p>","<h2>Motor and hand function development</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If we lowered the child on a flat surface already in 4th month, he/she begins to use open hands for <strong>support </strong>while moving on flat surfaces as early as 6th month.</li>
	<li>When the child starts sitting, by moving from sitting to other positions, he/she begins to use his/her arm and open hand to <strong>protect him/herself </strong>from falling on his/her head.</li>
	<li>Children who begin to stand up use their hands to <strong>pull themselves up</strong> into a standing position.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development of grasping</h2>

<p>With better motor control, the hand becomes more precise in grasping, manipulating and exploring what is in the environment.</p>

<p>In the third and fourth trimesters, the development of the grasping function proceeds as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>moving a toy from hand to hand</li>
	<li>holding one toy in each hand, banging them against each other</li>
	<li>grasping toys of different sizes and shapes (adjusting hand opening)</li>
	<li>trying to grasp and hold as many as three or four objects of smaller circumference</li>
	<li>squeezing soft objects</li>
	<li>turning the pages of a book</li>
	<li>opening boxes, lifting lids off boxes, taking wipes out of packs</li>
	<li>separating two joined blocks</li>
	<li>separating the forefinger for exploration, sticking a finger into holes, separating the forefinger for pointing</li>
	<li>pulling a toy tied to a string</li>
	<li>liking to lift heavier things (bottles full of water, toy boxes)</li>
	<li>pushing and pulling boxes with toys, furniture (chairs, tables, clothes drying rack)</li>
	<li>grasping small objects with the tips of his/her fingers, thumb and forefinger, and then with the tips of the thumb and forefinger (pincer grasp)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hand and feeding</h2>

<p>This age is also characterized by the introduction of non-milk foods. Food that we have cooked and prepared for blending or puréeing should pass ""hand quality control"". Allow the child to touch, crush, smear, throw, lick, put food in his/her mouth. Through the hands, the child will get quality information about what food is, what its texture and shape are, how it smells and, later, how it tastes, and will memorize all the necessary information about it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>how to pick it up, what grasp to use</li>
	<li>what its texture is: soft, rough, squishy, moist</li>
	<li>he/she will learn about size and shape: large, small, round, oblong</li>
</ul>

<p>These things are also important in preparation for chewing and speaking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hand serves to support, protect, grasp, hold on to something, manipulate, ""experience"" different qualities from the environment. The child ""sees"" objects with his hand using a fine network of nerve endings and ""complements"" the image of what surrounds him/her. Therefore, explore together, taking care of his/her safety, of course (sharp, small objects, toxic substances such as household chemicals that he/she can reach, movable objects that he/she can pull on and get injured if they fall).</p>

	<li>feeling, scratching, tapping, turning, grasping cups, strainers, whiskers, stirring spoons, lids</li>
</ul>

<p>At this age, ""toys"", i.e. objects for everyday use that the parent uses, are a real challenge to the child for research and imitation of activities. Children like to turn, spin, move, pull things, put their index finger into the openings, bang, take off, throw, put things in their mouths. Each toy undergoes a detailed ""inspection"". Children love:</p>

<ul>
	<li>blocks with different functions (pressing, opening, moving, rotating parts)</li>
	<li>musical toys: drums, rattles, pianos</li>
	<li>balls of various sizes, colors, shapes, textures</li>
	<li>toys with attached strings that they can pull on</li>
	<li>roller coasters (wires bent in different ways with balls that move from one side to the other)</li>
	<li>toys that produce sound or light signals by pressing buttons</li>
	<li>books</li>
	<li>shape sorter toys (they will insert round items first, and later other shapes as well)</li>
	<li>boxes in several sizes that can be put into one another: from the largest to the smallest</li>
	<li>Rock-a-Stack with rings that are first removed, and then stacked back on the base.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The child's safety always comes first; all toys must have a safety certificate. They must not have sharp edges, be made of easily breakable plastic, with small parts that can be torn off easily because children put them in their mouths and/or throw them, which poses a risk of injury.</p>

<p>Once again: the most important toy for a child of this age is the quality time you spend playing together, in daily routines and activities, in interaction, laughter, imitation, sharing love.</p>

4866,Newborn toys: first trimester,"<p>""The baby is young."" ""We haven't given him/her."" ""What toys are the best?"" These are some of the dilemmas parents face when it comes to toys. The answer is simple: The best toy you can give your child is the time you spend playing with him/her.</p>","<h2><strong>Newborn toys</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>your face that appears every time he/she is upset</li>
	<li>addressing him/her in a higher pitch, at moderate volume, with a smiling face</li>
	<li>touching his/her fist from the little finger towards the thumb with your hands to stimulate fist opening</li>
</ul>

<p>Towards the end of the first month, adequate toys are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>balls, larger cubes, different textures to stimulate eye tracking and fist opening</li>
	<li>musical toys with rhythmic melodies and soft sound</li>
	<li>in order for a child to follow a toy with his/her eyes and open his/her fists, you must hold him/her on your lap or in your hands, as if in a nest, because any louder sound, sudden change of position or too many visual stimulations by quick movement of the toy will cause crying and interrupt the game.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Toys for babies up to 3 months</strong></h2>

<p>The period of 2nd and 3rd months is characterized by longer waking periods. More and more often, the child brings his/her hands to the mouth, puts them in the mouth and plays with his/her own body and body parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>he/she can intertwine his/her fingers, he/she grasps his/her shirt </li>
	<li>he/she turns his/her head freely to one side and the other</li>
	<li>he/she coos and makes different sounds </li>
	<li>he/she grasps toys with his/her hands, but, at the same time, bends his/her legs towards the tummy and ""grasps"" them with his/her feet</li>
</ul>

<p>Put  larger toys on the child's chest, so that he/she places open hands on it and draws it to his/her mouth. Hold a toy so that he/she can touch it and grasp it with his/her feet. Put your head on the child's chest so that he/she can grasp your hair, or the father's beard; this provides strong stimulation to open the fists and grasp. </p>

<p>Put the child on his/her tummy. To ensure stability, you can roll up a towel and place it under the child's chest. Always place his/her elbows in front of the shoulder line, which ensures a stable position on the tummy and allows the child to easily open his/her hands to feel the toys. Move the toy slowly in the child's field of vision. Move the toy closer so that he/she can feel it.</p>

<p>This is also the right time for: rattles, balls, cubes with different textures, making soft sounds, which the child can safely put in his/her mouth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Play with your child when he/she is active and awake. Through play in this period, you facilitate:</p>

<ul>
	<li>stimulation of tracking an object with his/her eye </li>
	<li>stimulation of fist opening and beginning to use the hands for grasping objects</li>
	<li>stimulation of social, emotional and speech development through storytelling and imitation of the sounds made by the child </li>

4881,Toddler creative learning and development: what to expect,"Creative play helps toddlers develop emotionally, physically, mentally and socially.
Experiencing, discovering, experimenting and creating are the most important parts of creative play for toddlers.
Toddlers can learn and develop through drama, visual arts and craft, music and sounds, and dance.","<h2>Creative play: why it’s important for toddler learning and development</h2>

<p>Drama, music, dance and visual art foster creativity and imagination in toddlers. These activities also help young children develop their senses through exploration and discovery. They let toddlers express how they see the world and their place in it.</p>

<p>Toddlers can use creative play to communicate their feelings. They might not always be able to say why they are feeling angry, depressed, happy or frightened. But in an encouraging environment, they might be able to use activities and experiences to express these feelings using paint, colour, movement, mime, dramatic gestures, singing or dancing.</p>

<p>Creative play lets toddlers try out different ideas and ways of doing things. The process of doing the activity is the most important part, not the final result.</p>

<p>Our ideas for toddler creative learning and development can you get you started on fun and creative activities with your child.</p>

<h2>Learning and development through drama</h2>

<p>Dramatic play for toddlers is about copying what they have seen others do. For example, your toddler might talk into a spoon as if it is a mobile phone. Or she might collect items in a bucket as if she is at the supermarket. This kind of dramatic play <strong>develops imagination</strong>.</p>

<p>Your child probably loves to ask ‘Why?’ Dramatic play <strong>helps your toddler work out answers</strong> for himself. It can help him come up with creative and imaginative responses to questions and problems. For example, if your child is pretending to drive a car, he needs to imagine where he is going, who else is in the car and whether he is at a red or green light.</p>

<h2>Learning and development through visual art and craft</h2>

<p>Toddlers love activities like finger-painting, pasting, colouring pictures, folding or ripping paper and making sculptures out of clay or playdough. These activities might be a bit messy, but they are good at helping your child:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>get used to new textures, like wet, slimy or sticky</li>
	<li>learn how paint and paper move, and what she can do with them</li>
	<li>develop all kinds of fine motor skills like the ability to hold pencils and use scissors</li>
	<li>express her thoughts, experiences or ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a finished or perfect product is not important. The key thing is for your child to explore his creative impulses, express himself and create something. Your toddler is still learning about shapes and lines, so his drawing might look like spaghetti to you – but to him, it is a tree!</p>

<h2>Learning and development through music</h2>

<p>Toddlers like to listen and observe. They also love to get involved in music and sound play. They will often start singing to themselves while they are involved in other play activities.</p>

<p>Songs and music play are <strong>good forms of self-expression</strong>.</p>

<p>Singing encourages your toddler to use words and helps develop her memory. Because her memory is not fully developed, she can remember only a few words at a time. But she can put actions to the words as you sing them, and add in the words she remembers.</p>

<p>Young toddlers also enjoy instruments, especially ones they can shake or bang. And as your toddler nears three years old, he will get better at playing along to a beat.</p>

<h2>Learning and development through dance</h2>

<p>Toddlers often start moving and dancing without you prompting them. Sometimes, it might even seem like they are in a trance while they are dancing – they can be very self-absorbed.</p>

<p>In fact, lots of things are going through your toddler’s mind while she is dancing. She is <strong>exploring fantasies, thoughts and feelings </strong>about music and her environment.</p>

<p>Dance helps your child <strong>develop gross motor skills, as well as hand-eye coordination</strong>.</p>

<p>Your child’s dancing might involve walking, balancing, jumping, galloping and hopping in response to music or chanted words. It does not matter whether he keeps time to the music or follows set movements – experiencing sounds and movement is the most important thing.</p>",5601,6,"49,50,51",59,60,"2586, 171, 1046, 156",,1,0,"<p>Imported Raising Children Australia Article: <a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/creative-development/toddler-creative-development"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/toddlers/development/creative-development/toddler-creative-development</a> </p>",en,published
4891,Toddler creative learning and development: ideas and activities,"Encourage creativity by following your child’s lead, providing time and space for play, and praising your child.
You can use household items, recycled objects and natural materials to spark your child’s creative play.
Creative play can be part of everyday activities – for example, sing as you give your child a bath.","<h2>Encouraging your toddler’s creative play</h2>

<p>For toddlers, creative play is about <strong>creating, imagining and expressing themselves</strong>. There is no right and wrong in how toddlers create and respond to art.</p>

<p>By taking a step back from your child’s play, you can encourage your toddler to explore his world in his own way. This is important for learning and development.</p>

<p>You can also encourage your toddler’s creative play by giving your toddler lots of free time for creative play. Some days your toddler might want five minutes. Other days it could be all morning, moving from one activity to another. When your child has enough time, she can come up with lots of creative ideas.</p>

<p>Make sure to give your child lots of praise, whatever he ends up creating. This helps him feel good about himself and encourages him to keep creating.</p>

<h2>Creative activities: visual art and crafts</h2>

<p>Your child can use everyday objects and recycled items for art and craft. Here are some ideas to get your child started:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Use empty kitchen paper rolls or small plastic bottles to make a puppet person or animal. Your child can decorate it with markers, stickers, scrap papers, fabric and other crafty bits.</li>
	<li>Use natural material. For example, go on a nature walk to collect fallen leaves. Your child can use these to draw, paste onto paper, or dip into paint.</li>
	<li>Find a very large cardboard box and let your child decorate it using crayons, paints and other decorations. It could be a house, boat, cave and so on. You could help your child cut out windows or doors.</li>
	<li>Make binoculars by taping two empty toilet rolls together. Tape on a strap on either side. Then your child can explore the garden with her new binoculars.</li>
	<li>Thread small plastic lids, large wooden beads or pasta tubes onto string to make jewellery. This might be a good activity for older toddlers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep a resource box of recycled objects and materials for homemade toys and creative play – for example, crayons, stickers, empty food containers, paper plates, bottle lids, wrapping paper scraps, egg cartons and ribbons. Just make sure that all the items are safe; it is very important that all the items for your toddler are not choking hazards and suffocation or strangulation hazards. Small beads and plastic bags are dangerous for young children.  Keep them out of reach.</p>

<h2>Creative activities: movement and dance</h2>

<p>These creative play ideas can help your toddler express himself through movement and dance:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Put on some music that will get your child moving. You could try different styles of music or music from other cultures.</li>
	<li>Join your toddler for a ‘warm-up’. For example, you could crawl, roll, jump, skip or spin around together. Gradually take a step back and let your child lead the dance.</li>
	<li>Give your child some props for dancing. These could be ribbons on sticks, a spoon and a box to beat, a toy guitar, a rattle or a home-made puppet  – whatever your child enjoys.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dramatic play ideas</h2>

<p>Toddlers love dramatic play. You can use simple props like old clothes, bags, dolls, toys, buckets and balls to help your child get started. Your child might:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>pat the ‘baby’ to sleep</li>
	<li>change ‘nappies’ on toys</li>
	<li>dress up like a mum, dad, teacher, doctor or truck driver</li>
	<li>pack some bags to go shopping, camping or to work</li>
	<li>drive an imaginary train</li>
	<li>wash a car or favourite toy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Music and sound play</h2>

<p>You can make music play part of other routines. You can also combine music, drama and dance.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to get you started:</p>

<ul type=""disc"">
	<li>Sing simple nursery rhymes or silly made-up songs while you are changing nappies, looking after children in the bath, travelling in the car and so on.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to sing along with you, but do not expect her to sing in tune or in time. You could sing the first line of a nursery rhyme and pause to let your child sing the rest.</li>
	<li>Let your child play, make noise and create music with homemade and bought instruments. Name the instruments you are using and talk about the differences in sound and how they are played.</li>
	<li>Try traditional nursery rhymes and songs that involve simple, repeated, rhythmical actions.</li>
	<li>Make a drum out of a plastic container and a wooden spoon, or put rice into a well-sealed plastic bottle to make a shaker. Put on some music and bang or shake fast or slow to match the music.</li>

<ul>
	<li>The vaccine contains several antigens: tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis (parts of the whooping cough bacterium), inactivated poliomyelitis viruses (three types of virus) and conjugated (tetanus protein bound) Hemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.  It also contains: sucrose, amino acids, aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant, phenoxyethanol, trometamol, and traces of residues of the production process (neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B).</li>
	<li>It is given according the routine immunization schedule of each country, usually 3 times until the age of 6 months and fourth  dose around the age of 1 year.</li>
	<li>The vaccine is given by injection into a muscle: in infants into the upper leg and in older children (older than 3 years) into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm.</li>
	<li>The pentavalent vaccine can be given together with other vaccines: a vaccine against hepatitis B or against a disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but at a different injection site. Hexavalent vaccines are also used, which contain the hepatitis B vaccine.</li>
	<li>If your child has not been vaccinated regularly, contact a pediatrician to receive the missing dose of the vaccine.</li>

4906,Whooping cough ( Pertusis),"Whooping cough starts like a cold and then a cough develops. Coughing bouts might end with a ‘whoop’ sound when children breathe in.
See your doctor as soon as possible if your child has whooping cough symptoms. The doctor might prescribe antibiotics to stop the infection spreading. Help to prevent whooping cough by getting your child immunised. Immunisation for pregnant women is also recommended.","<h1>About whooping cough</h1>

<p>Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease caused by <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>, a type of bacteria. It’s passed on through close personal contact, sneezing and coughing.</p>

<p>Whooping cough is also called pertussis.</p>

<p>Although children are routinely immunised against whooping cough, there are outbreaks of whooping cough from time to time.</p>

<h2>Whooping cough symptoms</h2>

<p>The whooping cough bacteria usually infects children 1-2 weeks before symptoms appear.</p>

<p>The early symptoms look like the symptoms of a cold. For around a week, children might have a runny nose, sneezing and occasionally a mild fever.</p>

<p>The cough develops gradually, children might have bouts of coughing that make it hard for them to breathe in. They might also make a ‘whooping’ sound at the end of coughing bouts as they gasp for a deep breath. The cough is commonly followd by vomiting and the child's face might  turn red.</p>

<p>The bouts of coughing get worse over the next two weeks, increasing both in severity and frequency. The coughing bouts can be exhausting, although children are usually comfortable between bouts.</p>

<p>The cough might hang around for months.</p>

<p>Children can be infectious for up to 21 days after the cough starts.</p>

<p>Children who have been immunised against whooping cough are much less likely to get the disease. If immunised children do get whooping cough, their symptoms are usually milder.</p>

<h2>Whooping cough complications</h2>

<p>In babies under six months of age, whooping cough often has serious complications including severe pneumonia and apnoeas (pauses in breathing). In young children, pneumonia is the most common complications.Death is rare and might happen almost only in unimmunised babies.</p>

<p>If your child has whooping cough and lost her appetite or is vomiting a lot with the coughing bouts, there’s a risk she might lose weight and get dehydrated.</p>

<h2>Should you see your doctor about whooping cough?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should take your child to the doctor if your child:</p>

<ul>
	<li>has any of the symptoms described above</li>
	<li>has repeated and distressing coughing fits</li>
	<li>has a cough that lasts longer than two weeks</li>
	<li>has trouble breathing or struggles for breath after coughing fits</li>
	<li>turns blue around the mouth after coughing fits</li>
	<li>has a prolonged fever as well as a cough</li>
	<li>has a cough and also complains of a sore ear</li>
	<li>already has whooping cough and is losing weight or looks dehydrated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your baby is aged under six months and you notice pauses in his breathing, you should take him to a hospital emergency department or to the doctor immediately.</p>

<h2>Whooping cough treatment</h2>

<p>Antibiotics don’t usually help with whooping cough symptoms, although <strong>your doctor might prescribe antibiotics</strong> to help prevent your child from passing whooping cough to others. </p>

<p>If the cough has lasted fewer than 21 days, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics because this treatment will reduce the length of time your child is infectious. This means your child can go back to child care, preschool or school earlier, usually after five days of antibiotics.</p>

<p>If the cough is severe and causes breathing difficulties, or if your child is less than six months old, your doctor might recommend a hospital stay for close nursing care. If the disease is severe enough for hospital admission, your child will be given antibiotics.</p>

<p>Other people in the house might be prescribed antibiotics to stop them catching whooping cough.</p>

<p>If your child hasn’t been treated with antibiotics, she shouldn’t go back to child care, preschool or school for 21 days after the cough starts.</p>

<h2>Whooping cough prevention</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid whooping cough is to have your child immunised. immunisation against whooping cough usually start at 6-8 weeks wtih repeated doses during the following months and years.</p>

<p><strong>Immunity against whooping cough fades with time.</strong> This means it’s possible to get the disease at a later age even if you’ve been immunised. This is why whooping cough vaccine is given several times during childhood and adlescence. </p>

<p>A whooping cough booster is also recommended for pregnant women in their third trimester. It protects your newborn for the first two months of life when he’s most at risk of complications from whooping cough.</p>",3471,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"136, 776, 711, 781, 306, 756","4686, 4896, 4901",1,0,"<ol>

4911,Tetanus,"Tetanus is an acute and highly lethal disease caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The bacteria can infect wounds and produce protein (toxin) that affects the nervous system which can lead to muscle cramps (spasms), and  inability to breath.","<p>The bacteria Clostridium tetani is found everywhere in nature: in the soil, in the intestines of animals. It can enter your child's body through a dirty skin injury, an animal bite, or a burn. In our environment, children have been successfully vaccinated against this disease so that the illness has almost disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>Signs and symptoms of the disease                                                                        </strong></p>

<p>The disease usually appear 1-2 weeks after infection. Tetanus infection leads to severe pain and cramps throughout the body. Painful muscle cramps (spasms) begin on the face, then the neck, torso and legs. When the muscles of the face and neck are affected, there are problems with swallowing and breathing. Before the era of vaccination, this disease was fatal in most cases (80% fatality rate).</p>

	<li>The child has a dirty wound or gets a deep cut, stab wound or scratch from a dirty object</li>
	<li>When labour is not sterile, the newborn baby can be infected.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tetanus treatment</strong></p>

<p>Treatment of tetanus is complicated and is carried out in a hospital setting. It includes the use of antitoxins and antibiotics, cleaning the wound, sometimes surgery. If necessary, medications to relieve pain, muscle stiffness are used as well as devices to support breathing.</p>

<p><strong>Tetanus prevention</strong></p>

<p>Tetanus is a disease that cannot be eradicated because the bacteria is present everywhere in nature. There is no acquired resistance even after having the infection. The best way to protect your child from this disease is to vaccinate her/him in time. According to the immunization recommendations, tetanus vaccines are given in three doses: the first one at the six weeks of age, while the second and the third doses are provided in intervals between 4 to 8 weeks. Tetanus vaccination is usually provided together with the vaccine against: diphtheria, whooping cough, polio and diseases caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenza b. In some countries re-vaccination is provided after two years of age along with diphtheria vaccine.</p>

<p>In case of an open skin injury, it is important to carefully clean the wound and remove all foreign material from it. If your child has not been adequately vaccinated or has been incompletely vaccinated, or has been appropriately vaccinated but more than 5-10 years have passed since the last dose of the vaccine (depending on the severity of the wound), the child doesn’t have the necessary protection. Take her/him to a paediatrician to check the vaccination status and determine if she/he needs to receive the vaccine and, in some situations also human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG).</p>

<p>A newborn who is born without professional medical help, with the risk of becoming infected with the bacterium Clostridium tetani, needs to immediately receive human tetanus immunoglobulin.</p>",5311,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,136,"4896, 4901, 4686",0,0,"<ol>

4916,Polio,"""Polio is a contagious viral disease caused by the polio virus. Upon entering the body through the mouth, the virus multiplies in the intestines, from where it can spread to the nervous system and may lead to muscle paralysis.""","<p>In 1988, the World Health Organization launched an initiative to eradicate poliomyelitis. Yet in 2019, there were still reported cases of this disease in the world.</p>

<p>Humans are the only natural reservoir for poliovirus. Spread is by contact with feces and/or respiratory secretions. The time elapsing from the introduction of the virus into the body until the development of symtpms ranges from 3 to 21 days.</p>

<p>A person with the virus can be contagious 7 to 10 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease, but the virus can be excreted in the stool for three to six weeks from the beginning of the disease.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms and signs of the disease</strong></p>

<p>Most infected children have no symptoms at all or have mild symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache and muscle aches. These flu-like symptoms usually last for a week. One out of 100 infected children has a stiff neck and vomiting as signs of meningitis, and in one child out of 200 infected, nerve damage and irreversible paralysis of the muscles of the lower limbs occur. As paralysis can affect the respiratory muscles, 2% to 5% of children with paralysis children die, and in adults, this number is higher and ranges from 15% to 30%.</p>

<p>For people who have suffered from polio, after 15 to 40 years, new pains and paralysis may occur, which is called post-polio syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of polio</strong></p>

<p>There is no cure for polio. Flu-like symptoms usually go away on their own. In case of discomfort and pain in the muscles, the use of paracetamol is recommended. The child should be encouraged to drink more fluids and get enough rest. Some children who suffer from the paralytic form of the disease will need physical treatment, while some will need help with feeding and breathing.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention of polio</strong></p>

<p>Even if there are no reported cases of polio in a country, the virus can be introduced from other countries where polio persists. That is why it is important to protect your child from this disease by immunization. There are two types of polio vaccines:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Inactivate polio vaccine (IPV): Contains killed polio viruses and given by injection. Killed vaccine is usually administered in combination with other vaccines.</li>
	<li>Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is weakened live polio virus given in drops to the mouth.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some countries use only killed vaccines. Other countries use also live vaccine.</p>

<p>WHO has recommended to stop using polio live vaccines during the next few years and continue only with the killed vaccine.</p>

<p>First dose of IPV at 6-8 weeks, two more doses at intervals 4-8 weeks.</p>

<p>One of the important protective measures regular hand washing to prevet transmission by ""dirty hands"".</p>",691,2,"44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,136,"4896, 4901, 4686",1,0,"<ol>

4921,Diseases caused by Hemophilus influenza type b (Hib),"Hemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a bacterium that can cause severe infections especially in children under 5 years of age such as:meningitis,  pneumonia, sepsis, Infections of bones and joints and severe infection at the base of the tongue that may cause suffocation (epiglotitis).","<p>The infection is transmitted through droplets and secretions that the infected person releases into the environment. In an unprotected (susceptible) person, the disease manifests itself within seven days after the bacteria enters the body.</p>

<p>In susceptible children who become infected, an infection of the upper respiratory tract may occur, which could lead to inflammation of other tissues and organs either through local spread or through the bloodstream.</p>

<p><strong>Signs and symptoms of the disease</strong></p>

<p><strong>Epiglotitis:</strong>  The <strong>epiglottis</strong> is a leaf-shaped flap in the throat behind the tongue that prevents food from entering the windpipe and the lungs. When it gets infected with HIB, it becomes swollen, and as it is at the entrance to the airway, the enterance narrows, and thus endangers the child's breathing capacity, therefore, his/her life. The child falls ill, turns pale, is upset, has an open mouth from which saliva drips, has difficulty swallowing and the swallowing is painful, breathing is complicated and is audible. Such a condition requires urgent medical intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Meningitis an other complications</strong>: By entering the bloodstream, through the upper respiratory tract, Hib spreads throughout the body and causes infection and inflammatory processes in other places: meninges, lungs, joints, subcutaneous tissue, most often the face and neck, etc.</p>

<p>Even today, these complications can occur in unvaccinated children, and the signs of the disease depend on the affected organ. Before the introduction of the vaccine, this bacterium was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, which manifests with a rise in body temperature, headache, drowsiness, stiff neck, vomiting and mental disorders. Despite the use of antibiotics, in 3% -6% of children, HIB meningitis is fatal and in up to 30% of affected children it ends with hearing impairment.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>

<p>Severe Infections are treated in the hospital with antibiotics.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention</strong></p>

<p>Severe diseases that can be caused by Hib bacteria can best be prevented by vaccination. The vaccine given to children in the first years of life is a conjugate vaccine (Hib), which means that part of the bacteria (polysaccharide antigen) binds to protein such as tetanus protein in order to stimulate the production of antibodies and to induce a long term immune memory.</p>

<p>The Hib vaccine can be administered  as a monovalent vaccine, or as part of a combined vaccine together with vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio, at the age of 2 months, 3.5-4  months, 5-6  months and 12-18 months.</p>

4926,Diphtheria,"Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphteriae. The bacterium causes inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, nose and throat, and produces toxins that can spread through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, such as the heart and the nerves and cause severe complications.","<p>Diphteria is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or through droplets that an infected person releases into the environment during coughing and sneezing. The incubation period (from the moment of infection to the first signs of the disease) is usually 2-5 days (could be 1 to 10 days).</p>

<p><strong>Signs and symptoms of the disease</strong></p>

<p>The bacterium causes inflammation of the nose, throat and tonsils and slightly elevated temperature. Within 2 to 3 days, bluish-white membranes of different sizes are formed on the tonsils, soft palate and pharynx. Similar changes can extend to the vocal cords when coughing, and hoarseness occur in addition to fever. These layers are firmly attached to the tissue, narrowing the airway and endanger breathing. The toxin that this bacterium creates is absorbed and spreads through the blood to diferent parts of the body and can lead to numerous complications.</p>

<p><strong>Complications</strong></p>

<p>The most common complications, which occur as a consequence of the action of diphtheria  toxins, are inflammation of the heart muscle and nerves. Heart complications include abnormal heart rates and heart failure. Nervous system involvement may cause abnormal level of consciousness and can lead to coma. The affected nerves can temporarily lose their function and paralysis occurs: of soft palate muscles, eye muscles, limb muscles, diaphragm, etc. These complications can be fatal and actually 20% of children younger than 5 years with diphteria die of this disease.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment of diphtheria</strong></p>

<p>During the treatment of diphtheria, antibiotics in the appropriate dose, antitoxin and general symptomatic support are used.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention (protection) from diphtheria</strong></p>

<p>Protection of children from diphtheria is provided by immunization. The diphtheria vaccine is given together with the vaccines against tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Hemophilus influenza B bacteria at the age of: 2 months, 3.5-4 months, 5-6 months and 12-18 months. Later doses are given together with the tetanus vaccine usually at school age according to the immunization schedule of each country.</p>

4931,Handling sibling fights,"Some sibling fights are a fact of life. After all, your children are still learning how to get along. When fights happen, the main thing is to stop them before somebody gets hurt. Then it’s time to help your children deal with the issues constructively.","<h2>Sibling fights: when to step in</h2>

<p>Sometimes it works to stand back from a sibling fight for a while, because this gives children the chance to sort it out for themselves. But it’s important to know when to step in to break up a sibling fight.</p>

<p><strong>When a disagreement gets physical or involves shouting or nasty remarks or name-calling</strong>, you need to break it up before someone gets hurt.</p>

<p>Lots of attention might actually reinforce fighting. That’s because children love any kind of attention, even attention for bad behaviour. If you’re going to give children attention when they fight, try to use the opportunity to help them learn skills for avoiding fights and solving problems in the future.</p>

<h2>Breaking up sibling fights: steps</h2>

<p>Here’s what to do when a fight breaks out:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Stop the fight before the crying starts.</strong> This might require physically separating your children, or sending them to opposite sides of the room to settle down.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep your cool.</strong> This might sound impossible, but the idea is not to make things worse. Try to save your energy for giving positive feedback on behaviour that you want to encourage.</li>
	<li><strong>Tell children you’ll talk about it later.</strong> Children are often too upset to take in what you’re saying at first. Wait until things cool down before you talk about the issue. This could even be the next day with older children.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a fight breaks out while you’re driving, always pull over. Turning around to talk to children or separate them takes your attention off the road.</p>

<h2>Handling sibling fights constructively: tips</h2>

<p>These tips can make it easier to cool things down when sibling fights break out:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Treat all children fairly.</strong> But remember that fair treatment isn’t necessarily the same treatment. For example, it might not be possible to treat a six-year-old and a two-year-old the same.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoid negative comparisons. </strong>Saying something like, ‘You should have known better because you’re older than him’ or ‘You’re the troublemaker’ can make a child feel even more hurt or resentful.</li>
	<li><strong>Identify the cause of fighting.</strong> This helps you work out the best thing to do. For example, if a child has taken a toy from a sibling, you need to step in. If you don’t, the child learns that fighting is a way to get what you want. Keeping an eye on your children is the secret to knowing the reason for the fighting – and deciding on the right way to deal it.</li>
	<li>Use family rules to make expectations about behaviour clear. You can remind your children of the relevant family rule and follow through consistently with any consequences.</li>
	<li><strong>Have a plan. </strong>This means thinking about how you’ll handle small disagreements as well as big fights. For example, you can help children work out small disagreements together, but you might decide to use consequences for fights involving physical violence, or for fights that happen after you’ve all agreed on a solution to a problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem-solving after a sibling fight: steps</h2>

<p>What you do after a fight can help children learn how to solve their own problems in the future. For best results, wait until tempers have cooled and children are ready to reason again.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Let children know what you plan to do.</strong> For example, ‘I’ve decided that neither of you should use the computer until we can find a way to stop the fighting. Do you understand? Are you willing to work on solving the problem now?’</li>
	<li><strong>Ask both children to say what they think the problem is.</strong> Encourage them to try to see it from the other person’s point of view as well as their own. You could tell them that two people might still disagree even when they both have valid points of view.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask both children to say what they want to happen.</strong> You can also help them think about their expectations. For example, ‘Tegan, is it fair for you to have the computer all the time?’</li>
	<li><strong>Brainstorm together.</strong> Let the children go wild with ideas on how to solve the problem, and encourage them without judging their ideas. Throw in some ideas of your own, and write them all down.</li>
	<li><strong>Rate the ideas.</strong> Start by asking the children to think of which ideas won’t work. Then look for the solution with the most benefits and the least drawbacks. For example, ‘Does anyone think this might work?’ ‘What would be good (or bad) about this?’</li>
	<li>If you can’t come up with a solution at first, <strong>come back later</strong>. You can ask the children to go away and work out some ideas together, or ask other people who have had similar problems. Or you might look for ideas in parenting books or websites.</li>
	<li>Once you’ve all agreed on an approach, <strong>try the solution and see how it goes</strong>. Start again if things don’t improve.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Handling your own emotions</h2>

<p>It’s normal if you feel stressed when fights break out. It’s also normal if some issues bother you more than others, and some days you get upset more quickly.</p>

<p>But staying calm can really help. If it’s safe and you don’t need to step in immediately, it can help to <strong>stop, count to 10, and then act</strong>.</p>

<p>That extra 10 seconds is often enough to calm your emotions. If this doesn’t help, you might want to ask another adult to handle things while you take some time out.</p>

<p>For more ideas, read our articles on stress, reducing stress and breathing for relaxation.</p>

<h2>When to seek help for sibling fighting</h2>

<p>If your children are very aggressive or nasty towards each other a lot of the time, it’s time to seek help.</p>

<p>This kind of fighting can be very distressing for children and can lead to future problems with relationships. So if you’re concerned about how your children behave when they disagree, it’s best to <strong>speak to a professional</strong>. Start by talking with your child’s GP.</p>

<p>Sometimes children’s fighting is caused by a condition like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which makes it hard for children to manage their behaviour. If you’re worried about your children’s behaviour more generally, it’s also a good idea to talk with a professional.</p>

<p>And <strong>if you’re feeling overwhelmed or stressed</strong> by fighting, it’s worth getting support. You could start by talking to family, friends and other parents. If you need advice right away, you can try a telephone hotline.</p>",6191,6,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"506, 2421, 516",,1,0,"<p><a href=""https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/friends-siblings/handling-fights"">https://raisingchildren.net.au/school-age/behaviour/friends-siblings/handling-fights</a></p>",en,published
4936,What causes autism and autism spectrum disorders,The exact cause of autism is still unknown. It is known that it is a joint influence of genetic and environmental factors. There is no proven link between vaccines and the development of autism.,"<p>Until recently, these disorders were thought to be caused by genetic factors, but recent research shows that environmental factors are equally important. What is unlikely is that there is one specific gene that is responsible for the development of this disorder. It is more likely that several genes combine and act together. Although many link autism to gastrointestinal disorders, studies have found no evidence of an increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders in children with autism. </p>

<p>Differences in the structure of brain tissue have been noticed in a certain number of children since the earliest age. It was found that brain size increased significantly more during the first years of life in children with autism compared to children of typical development. So different parts of the brain did not communicate typically. However, in children with autism at the age of 10-15, the average brain size is similar to the brain size of children without developmental disabilities, while later in adulthood there is a tendency to reduce the volume of gray and white mass in people with autism. </p>

<p>A large amount of evidence from various studies indicates that we must not forget the role of maternal and postnatal immune dysregulation in the development of autism. </p>

<p>Environmental factors that may be associated with autism include: exposure to environmental pesticides, viruses (chickenpox, rubella), retinoic acid, use of certain drugs in pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy, age of parents, complications in childbirth associated with trauma or ischemia and lack of oxygen. </p>

<p>There is no proven link between vaccines and the development of autism. </p>",6206,2,"51,52,57,58",59,60,2291,"4871, 4936, 4941",0,0,"<p><a href=""https://imh.org.rs/"">https://imh.org.rs/</a> </p>",en,published

4946,Who diagnoses autism,"Primary health care providers should play a crucial role in early recognition of a child's developmental problems, coordination of support, childcare and family support.","<p>Early recognition of autism symptoms is of great importance because it enables a timely detailed assessment or referral of the child, when necessary, for additional diagnostics in institutions of secondary and tertiary level of health care. </p>

<p>The diagnosis of autism is made after a detailed observation and examination of the child by a multidisciplinary team that usually includes a pediatrician, child psychiatrist, psychologist, special educator-speech therapist. </p>

<p>There is no autism test that can be performed as a imaging method or by taking biochemical analyzes. Instead, the diagnosis of autism is based on observing how the child plays and communicates with other people and children, based on conversations with parents about the child's development and functioning, as well as by using specific autism assessment tools for which professionals need to be trained (CARS, ADI- R, ADOS). </p>

<p>Healthcare professionals and associates will assess in detail the child's communication skills, speech and language development, development of cognitive skills, social skills, play skills, as well as the child's motor development. </p>

<p>For children who receive confirmation of a diagnosis of autism, parents receive a clear description of how serious the symptoms are, as well as how much and what kind of support is necessary for the child in the future. </p>

<p>It is necessary to include the child in the early intervention program, which as a measure of developmental stimulation will be focused on the areas where deviations are manifested. It is important to include the child in such programs from the moment you notice that there are deviations in the child's development, until the final diagnosis, and once diagnoses is made, continue with recommended interventions. Interventions should include individual work with the child, training of parents to stimulate the child's development at home, counseling parents, support in including the child in preschool setting. </p>

<p>There are various barriers that need to be overcome to set the early diagnosis, such as: non-acceptance of the parents that there is a problem with their child, late referral by the chosen doctor/pediatrician, insufficiently trained staff, lack of staff to conduct early interventions. </p>

<p>Research shows that it is possible to make an early diagnosis, as early as at 18 months, and then it is necessary to start with early interventions that have been proven to give the best results in improving the child's various abilities in all areas of development. </p>",5491,2,"51,52,57,58",59,60,"5236, 2291, 2281","4871, 4941, 4936",0,0,"<p><a href=""https://imh.org.rs/"">https://imh.org.rs/</a></p>",en,published

The team for early intervention usually consists of pediatricians, psychologists, special educators, speech therapists, social workers, nurses.  </p>

<p>Early intervention is carried out for children up to the age of 5-6, who have developmental delays and developmental deviations, but it is best to start with it as early as possible. Early intervention is very important due to the huge developmental potential of the child in the first years of life and the plasticity of the brain, which enables the achievement of optimal development of a child with developmental difficulties. </p>

4956,What does child abuse and neglect mean?,"""Abuse is any form of physical (physical), emotional and sexual abuse, neglect, negligent treatment or exploitation of a child that results in actual or potential danger to the child's health, survival, development or dignity.""","<p>Abuse is most often thought of as severe beatings or sexual abuse. However, emotional abuse and neglect of children are more common, and their impact on children's mental health is equally harmful. Child abuse and neglect can be a single incident or a number of incidents that occur over time. Children are mostly abused by people who take care of them, and most often it is their parents. If the parents live separately, the child abuser may be the current partner of the parent caring for the child.</p>

<p>Abusers can be other people who take care of the child: the elderly, foster parents, as well as people who have professional responsibility for the child, power in relation to the child or people in whom the child has confidence (for example, educator, teacher, coach, etc.) . Unknown persons who use information and communication technology to establish a relationship with a child for the purpose of abusing a child can also be abusers. Other children often appear as abusers.</p>

4961,Physical abuse of children,"""Physical abuse of a child means frequent or one-time ill-treatment of a child, intentional infliction of pain, bodily injury, as well as any treatment of parents and other persons involving a potential risk of bodily injury.""","<p><strong>Examples of physical abuse</strong> are: slapping, hitting, kicking, shaking (mostly in infants), squeezing the neck, throwing, poisoning, burning, pouring hot liquid or immersing body parts in hot liquid, exposing the child to hot steam, tying the child, assault with a weapon, leaving a young child alone in the car, etc.</p>

<p>The most common <strong>form of physical abuse</strong> committed by adults is corporal punishment of a child as a disciplinary measure in ""educating a child"". Corporal punishment is very dangerous for children, it is a significant cause of death of children and a factor in encouraging violent behavior and other behavioral disorders in children.</p>

<p><strong>How to recognize a child who has been physically abused?</strong></p>

<p>Physical violence does not necessarily cause bodily harm to children, nor do injuries always have to be visible. If you notice bruises of different ages in a child (in unusual places such as the face, thighs, lower legs, back, abdomen, nape, etc.), burns, broken bones, cuts, scratches, split ends, torn hair, it may be a physically abused child. If a child is unusually cautious in contact with adults, over-satisfies adults, is shy, withdrawn or hyperactive, finds it difficult to establish relationships with peers, has poor social, cognitive and language skills, shows a tendency to solve problems with aggression, shows anger for no reason, it can indicate a physically abused child.</p>

<p><strong>How to recognize a child who is emotionally abused?</strong></p>

<p>Physical indicators of emotional abuse are retardation in the growth and development of the child, urination and defecation in the panties, banging of the head, biting, sleep disorders and headaches. If you notice unusual emotional reactions in a child, such as phobias, hypochondria, obsession, behavioral extremes, anxiety, inappropriate ""old"" behavior or infantile behavior, sudden changes in the child's appearance or school success, it may be an emotionally abused child. Depression, suicide attempts and abandonment of the family environment by the child may also indicate this form of abuse.</p>",2661,3,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,4686,"5036, 4956, 4981",0,0,"<p><a href=""https://imh.org.rs/"">https://imh.org.rs/</a></p>",en,published

4986,Children and parents' hostile divorce,"<p>Studies show that about 40% of children worldwide experience their parents' parting, and this is considered one of the more stressful events in life. Children can react in different ways, and most of them adapt to the new situation over time.</p>","<p>When parental conflict continues even after the divorce, it may look like a war in which children are innocent collateral victims. Parental conflict can sometimes be so bitter that children find themselves at the center of it and become subject to manipulation by parents. Manipulating children during divorce is defined as a series of behaviors, verbal and non-verbal messages whereby one parent instills a negative image of the other, in order to distance him/her from the children.</p>

<p>Parents' actions that can be characterized as manipulation are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nasty comments about the other parent</li>
	<li>Demeaning and insulting the other parent</li>
	<li>False accusations of abuse by the other parent</li>
	<li>Polarization between parents (portraying one parent as completely perfect, while the other is entirely bad)</li>
	<li>Obstruction or prohibition of meeting the other parent's family members</li>
	<li>Absence of positive comments, stories and memories involving the other parent</li>
	<li>Encouraging the child to “exploit” the other parent</li>
	<li>Excessive indulgence to the child in order to win his/her affection</li>
	<li>Organizing various pleasant events just at the time when the child is supposed to see the other parent</li>
	<li>Overcontrolling and encroaching on the time the child spends with the other parent</li>
	<li>A sad facial expression or verbalizing sadness when the child goes to see the other parent</li>
</ul>

<p>This behavior on the part of one parent can lead to the child developing the parental alienation syndrome in respect of the other parent. The parental alienation syndrome can manifest in the child through various reactions. The child's reactions will depend on whether alienation is mild, moderate or severe.</p>

4991,Preoccupation with motherhood in the first year,"<p>With the birth of a child, the mother establishes a new, unique psychological organization termed ""preoccupation with motherhood."" It is the psychological basis for the formation of the parental identity and the self-actualization as a parent. This change allows the mother to reorganize her previous life (desires, needs, attitudes, goals, priorities).</p>","<p>The topics that occupy the mother of a newborn child or dominate new motherhood include: </p>

<p>1. Child growth and development - is she able to care for the child?<br />
2. Mutual relationship - is she able to engage in an authentic emotional relationship with her child and does this engagement enable the child to develop as desired/expected?<br />
3. Supportive environment - will the parents/partners/family know how to form/enable the necessary support system?<br />
4. Identity reorganization - will the mother/father be able to change their own identity to enable and facilitate these functions?</p>

<p>Each topic consists of ideas, desires, fears, memories and motives that determine or influence maternal feelings, actions, interpretations, relationships with people around them and other forms of behavior.</p>

<p><br />
<em>Preoccupation with motherhood</em> is not universal, nor is it innate. As a temporary psychological reorganization, it can last for months, sometimes years, and aims to provide the best matrix (base) for the new family member.  There is indisputably a psychobiological and hormonal basis for the emergence of this organization, but it seems that socio-cultural factors can play a decisive role in how this psychobiological basis will manifest itself and how the mother's role will be defined. Also, a man may be able to develop, in a special way, such a psychological organization.</p>

<p>In order for a mother to create an appropriate and supportive environment (nest) for the child's development, she needs to feel sufficiently supported, valued, respected, to feel that she belongs to a new group of mothers, to feel competent (skilled) for this new function and role, to be confident in her partner or other people around her.</p>

<p> <br />
Historically, traditionally, the matrix once consisted of extended family with experienced women who helped the new mother, and later the mothers of a young child. Nowadays, the structure of the supportive nest is different - the father's role is more prominent, the role of the extended family is played down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is triggered by pregnancy continues with the birth of a child - it awakens memories of one's own childhood, relationship with one's own mother, and sparks the desire for reorganization (maturity) of that relationship. Participation in parenting schools organized from the second trimester of pregnancy helps in achieving the best possible reorganization.<br />

4996,Parental mental health in the perinatal period,"<p>The perinatal period (pregnancy and postpartum period) is usually a time of sound mental health. During this period, women may also suffer from mood swings and anxiety, but this usually resolves spontaneously when the hormones stabilize in the first weeks after giving birth.</p>","<p>Although the birth of a baby is often anticipated with great joy, for some women, men and families in general, pregnancy and the postpartum period may turn into a period of stress and challenges. Mental health problems in pregnant women or women who have recently given birth, as well as future and ""new"" fathers, occur in all countries and cultures. This disorder is usually called ""depression"". </p>

<p>According to the UK Fatherhood Institute, it has been determined that, on average, 10.4% of fathers suffer from depression both before and after the birth of a child, and the highest rate of depression in fathers occurs between the third and sixth month after birth. Depression in fathers is associated with problems with the baby's sleep/crying; father's neuroticism and substance abuse/addiction; mild personality disorders in the mother and her current mental state; attitudes toward fatherhood and masculinity; feeling excluded from the parental role, inability to take care of the baby and build a relationship with him/her; lack of support for fatherhood; poor quality of partner relationship; disagreements regarding pregnancy, worries and additional responsibilities; unfulfilled expectations; etc.<br />
<br />
Based on research, strong evidence has been obtained that these parental difficulties can negatively affect the baby's development before and after birth, causing hormonal changes and toxic stress that interferes with brain development; in addition, they can negatively affect certain areas of child development and well-being later.</p>

<p>Mental health disorders during pregnancy and after childbirth (perinatal period) are usually classified into three to four groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Baby blues</strong> - is usually mild and temporary malaise, most commonly during the first two weeks after birth, and can last a very short time (several days).  Women feel as if they have no control over their emotions, which range from crying, sadness, anxiety, nervousness, to increased addiction and being overwhelmed with responsibilities.</li>
	<li><strong>Perinatal depression -</strong> constant, ubiquitous low mood of varying intensity and duration. It affects approximately one in ten women during pregnancy, 10-15% of women (and up to 10% of men) at any time after childbirth, or more than 30% during the first year after childbirth. Untreated depression may continue in the second and third year, as well as also after the birth of any child.</li>
	<li><strong>Anxiety,</strong> which can occur in both mothers and fathers, is manifested through pronounced fears, including panic accompanied by avoidant behavior, but also through more serious symptoms in the domain of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress, acute stress.</li>
	<li><strong>Puerperal psychosis</strong> - occurs only in women and affects approximately 1-2 mothers per 1000 births; it occurs suddenly (usually within just a few days), but sometimes it may take some time to detect it. </li>
</ul>

<p>A number of risk factors make some mothers and fathers more vulnerable, here are just a few: low education and social vulnerability; women's low social status; women's low income and education levels, their social exclusion and very little impact on their own lives; age (younger mothers and younger fathers are more likely to have poor mental health); adverse or stressful experiences (such as childhood abuse, living in poverty, without financial means, insecure housing situation, recent loss of a loved one or migration); unstable or unsupportive relationship with a life partner (e.g. substance abuse, violence, partner's poor mental health, non-acceptance of pregnancy, pregnancy early in the relationship, parents living in separate households); weak family and social support system or lack thereof, and many others. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recently, a number of famous women shared with the public their own experiences about why motherhood was a very difficult, or even painful, experience for them in the beginning, until they got professional assistance. They stress that it is necessary to raise public awareness and reduce the stigma associated with some of these mental health difficulties or even disorders. </p>

5036,The importance of parents' mental health for child development,"<p>There are a number of reasons why perinatal disorders can negatively affect the development of the fetus before birth: stress hormones in pregnant women, e.g. cortisol, pass through the placenta and affect the development of the fetal brain; a depressed pregnant woman is less likely to have a healthy lifestyle, less likely to go to prenatal health checks, less likely to get treatment when she is ill and less likely to prepare for motherhood; depression can adversely affect a pregnant woman's immune system; a baby can be born prematurely or with a low birth weight.</p>","<p>The physical and mental health of the mother and father during pregnancy, and even before that period, lays the first foundations for a young child to thrive successfully. Often, the health system is more focused on medical tests, such as measuring the blood pressure and body weight of pregnant and postpartum women, than on the mental health and well-being of the mother and her partner, although they can have a significant impact on the fetus.  </p>

<p>Thanks to numerous scientific studies, we know that the state of tension, anxiety, increased worrying, stress and depression raises the level of cortisol in the mother's bloodstream, and that the filtration capacity of the placenta is reduced, which allows elevated cortisol to pass to the baby's brain. Research has found that this negatively affects the brain architecture of unborn child (fetus), which is developing rapidly.</p>

<p>In addition, a pregnant woman who suffers from anxiety, tension and increased worrying, depression or any other mental disorder finds it difficult to follow the principles of healthy living that are necessary for a good pregnancy outcome (not consuming cigarettes, alcohol and other substances, regular and healthy diet, physical exercise to the extent possible, regular and sufficiently long sleep and rest, etc.), does not seek treatment or alleviation of health problems in time.</p>

<p>Because of all these considerations, perinatal mental disorders in parents, especially if they are not attended to in time and in the right way, may negatively affect or have consequences for many aspects of effective parenting after a child is born. These may include the following: </p>

<ul>
	<li>The development of the relationship with the baby can be compromised, i.e. the mother's and father's ability to connect emotionally with the baby, to rejoice at seeing their baby's first reactions and to establish an emotional exchange with him/her and each other.</li>
	<li>Relationships between partners and with other family members can also be disrupted.</li>
	<li>The parents' ability to ""listen"" and responsiveness (the ability to elicit the baby's response and adequately respond to his/her moves and signals) may also be impaired. Development is best stimulated in the context of a warm, responsive and caring parent-child relationship. Lack of responsiveness or inadequate (e.g. unpredictable) responsiveness activates a physiological stress response in an infant.  </li>
	<li>A depressed mother or father sometimes cannot see and understand what the baby may show or do according to age; they do not recognize the stages of development and motivation (for example, they cannot understand why a one-month-old baby does not allow them to sleep through the night without interruptions, they may even think that the baby cries ""on purpose"").</li>
	<li>The parents' ability to see their baby in a positive light is reduced.</li>
	<li>Parental assessment of what their baby needs (in terms of health, safety and care) may be unreliable.</li>
	<li>Maternal or paternal tolerance of the environment is reduced, apathy increases, as well as the lack of emotional reaction to the child.</li>
	<li>Baby and young child growth, development and behavior are closely related to caregivers' behavior.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>When the mother or father is depressed, it can have a serious adverse effect on the development of the baby's brain, and thus all areas of cognitive and socio-emotional development, including skills and executive functions.  </p>

<p>Research shows that both maternal and paternal depression and anxiety are associated with developmental problems in the child and affect socio-emotional and cognitive functioning, planning, organization, and control of behaviors according to context.  Research also indicates that children of mothers who suffer from perinatal disease are more likely to have problems in socio-emotional and cognitive functioning, planning, organization and behavior control according to the context.</p>

5056,Optimal nutrition at 6 months,"Around the 6th month of life, your baby will need food other than your milk for healthy growth and development. Breast milk is still the basic food for an infant, with two meals of non-dairy food.","<p>Starting at about 6 months, your baby needs other foods in addition to breast milk for healthy growth and development. Commercial baby foods have ingredients that may be harmful to the baby, including extra fat, salt, sugar and preservatives, in addition the consistency is different from the consistency of natural, local foods.  It is important for your baby’s tastes to be accustomed to natural foods.</p>

<p>It is still important to continue breastfeeding your baby on demand both day and night.</p>

<p>Breast milk continues to be the most important part of your baby’s diet.  There is no need to give infant formula or follow-up formulas (which are specially formulated milks for older children from 6 months of age), as breastmilk with a diversified diet provides all the nutrients your child needs.  <strong>Remember to breastfeed first before giving other foods. </strong></p>

<p>When giving complementary foods, there are six important things to remember:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Feed your baby complementary foods 2 times a day</li>
	<li><strong>Amount</strong>: Give 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls (‘tastes’) at each feed.</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong>: should be thick enough to be fed by hand and should not fall of the spoon easily.</li>
	<li><strong>Variety</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>Start with one food item at a time, continue for 3 days with the same food and notice how the child reacts to each food item, one by one. If more than one non-dairy food is introduced at the same time, in case of an allergic reaction, it cannot be concluded which is causing the allergy.</li>
		<li>Do not add any sugar or salt to food. Don’t feed biscuits/cakes, tea or other sugary foods to your baby.</li>
		<li>Begin with the staple foods like thick porridge made with porridge – made from rice, buckwheat, or oatmeal.</li>
		<li>First, introduce mashed vegetables such as pumpkin, carrot, spinach</li>
		<li>Then introduce fruits (banana), and locally available fruits, so your baby can become accustomed to the taste of vegetables.</li>
		<li>The thick porridge can be enriched with egg, fruits, lentils, leafy greens, meat or dairy.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Responsive feeding</strong>:  The baby may need time to get used to eating foods other than breast milk. - Be patient and actively encourage your baby to eat. Don’t force your baby to eat. Use a separate plate to feed the baby to make sure he or she eats all the food given.</li>
	<li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Good hygiene (cleanliness) is important to avoid diarrhea and other illnesses. Use a clean spoon or cup to give foods or liquids to your baby. -Store the foods to be given to your baby in a safe hygienic place. - Wash your hands with soap and water before preparing foods and feeding baby. Wash your hands and your baby’s hands before eating. Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet and washing or cleaning baby’s bottom.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Foods to avoid at this age</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Whole cow, goat, or sheep’s milk unboiled – (this can be fed to the child, but it must be boiled beforehand)</li>
	<li>Any kinds of nuts and seeds</li>
	<li>Avoid fruit and citrus juices</li>
	<li>Do not add sugar, honey, salt, spices</li>
	<li>Do not feed your child tea (black, green, herbal).</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Feeding according to the needs of the child</strong></p>

<p>When you start introducing solid foods, it is a good idea to initially choose a time when both you and your baby are happy and relaxed.  It may take some time for the baby to get used to eating food other than milk. Be patient and actively encourage the child to eat, but do not force him. It takes time and patience for a child to master new skills.</p>

<p>Observe your baby and react to his signals. Feed the child slowly and patiently, following his / her rhythm. Try different combinations of foods, flavors and textures to encourage your child to eat their meal. Wait for the child to stop eating before offering it again. Stop feeding when he shows he has had enough.</p>

<p>Signs by which the baby shows that she is hungry: she is excited when she sees that the food is ready, leans towards you in the feeding chair, opens her mouth.</p>

<p>Signs by which the baby shows that he is full: he eats more slowly, pushes food away from himself, does not want to open his mouth, shakes his head.</p>

5081,Measles (morbilli),"<p>Measles is a highly contagious exanthematous viral disease. The cause of the disease is the measles virus, which spreads easily from person to person through droplets when coughing and sneezing or by direct contact.</p>","<p>To prevent measles, vaccination against this disease has been conducted continuously in our country since 1971. Thus, a period of almost 20 years without measles was achieved until 2017, when the virus was reintroduced into the country and caused an epidemic due to the decline in the number of vaccinated children. Vaccination coverage of children has improved, but not enough, because we still have reported cases of measles.      </p>

<h2><strong>Disease signs and symptoms</strong></h2>

<p>The child becomes infected 7 to 15 days before the first disease symptoms appear. The disease begins with: fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, followed by the appearance of a reddish blotchy rash in 2 to 3 days. A characteristic sign of this disease are Koplik's whitish-bluish spots on the inside of the cheeks, which can be seen before the appearance of the rash. The rash starts on the hairline and then spreads to the face, upper neck and down to the chest, over the limbs, to the hands and feet. It fades and disappears in the same order in which it appeared and lasts for a maximum of 5 to 6 days. Other signs of the disease are loss of appetite, diarrhea, and generalized swelling of the lymph nodes.</p>

<p>An infected person is contagious about 4 days before and after the rash appears.</p>

<h2><strong>Complications</strong></h2>

<p>Complications occur in 30% of affected children: diarrhea with dehydration, ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis, permanent nerve damage (most often blindness). Due to these complications, in developed countries, 0.2% of affected children die, while in underdeveloped countries this rate is substantially higher, even up to 25%, with malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency as contributory factors.</p>

<h2><strong>Medications</strong></h2>

<p>There is no specific medicine for measles; in practice, medicines are used to relieve the discomfort. Paracetamol is given to lower fever and relieve headache. The child is offered more fluids than usual and allowed to rest in a slightly darkened room. Sufficient intake of vitamin A is ensured.  </p>

<h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

<p>Active immunization against measles is carried out with a combined vaccine containing vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) at the age of 12 to 15 months, and the second dose, revaccination, is given to children before starting school, at 6/7 years of age. When these children are vaccinated regularly, they also protect children who cannot receive the vaccine, because they prevent the spread of the virus.

Ice packs may also help with pain and swelling. Immunisation is the best protection against mumps..""","<h1>About mumps</h1>

<p>Mumps is caused by the mumps virus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva or ‘droplets’ from sneezing and coughing.</p>

<p>Mumps is rare in  countries having a good vaccination programmes.</p>

<h2>Mumps symptoms</h2>

<p>The mumps virus usually infects children 14-15 days before any symptoms appear.</p>

<p>Early mumps symptoms are fever, headache and tiredness.</p>

<p>These symptoms are followed by swelling of one of the salivary glands. The swelling starts in front of the ear and spreads under the jaw. Sometimes swelling happens in both salivary glands, so both sides of the face get swollen. Because of the swelling, it might be painful when your child chews or swallows.</p>

<p>Boys with mumps can sometimes get swelling and pain in their testicles. This usually doesn’t cause problems with future fertility.</p>

<p>In very rare cases, mumps can lead to meningitis, encephalitis and problems with hearing. Mumps can also cause myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart muscle.</p>

<p>Children with mumps are infectious from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to five days after the swelling begins.</p>

<h2>Does your child need to see a doctor about mumps?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should take your child to the doctor if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>you think your child has mumps</li>
	<li>your son has mumps and develops swollen, tender testicles</li>
	<li>your child has mumps and complains of a severe headache, becomes drowsy, starts vomiting or can’t stand bright light.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tests for mumps</h2>

<p>Your doctor might take a blood sample or swab from your child’s mouth to confirm that your child has mumps.</p>

<h2>Mumps treatment</h2>

<p>Most children recover fully from mumps with no problems.</p>

<p><strong>There’s no specific treatment for mumps, but here are some ways to ease your child’s symptoms:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses to help lower his fever and reduce pain and discomfort.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to drink plenty of water and get lots of rest.</li>
	<li>Give your child soft foods to eat so she doesn’t have to chew too hard.</li>
	<li>Avoid giving your child sour foods because these foods can stimulate saliva.</li>
	<li>In some cases you may put an ice pack on the sore and swollen parts of your child’s face.</li>
</ul>

<p>And remember to wash your hands carefully if you’re caring for a child with mumps.</p>

<p>Children who have mumps shouldn’t attend child care, preschool or school until at least five days after their swelling started.</p>

<h2>Prevention of mumps</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid mumps is to have your child immunised. This gives your child 95% protection against mumps.</p>

<p>Mumps vaccine is part of the MMR vaccine, which protects your child from measles, mumps and rubella (German measles).</p>

<p>Some parents are worried that the MMR vaccine is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There’s no scientific evidence that vaccines are linked to the development of ASD. If you have any concerns about the MMR vaccine, it’s a good idea to discuss them with your doctor.</p>",5551,2,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"131, 126, 136, 751, 306, 756, 346, 711","5071, 5076, 4686",1,0,"<p>1. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html"">https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mumps.html</a></p>

The main risk of rubella is a severe damage the developing baby in womb when his pregnant mother becomes infected during preganacy . See your doctor if you think your child has rubella or you’re pregnant and think you might have been in contact with rubella. The best way to prevent rubella is to immunise your child. .""","<h1>About rubella or German measles</h1>

<p>Rubella or German measles is caused by rubella virus. This virus spreads through personal contact, coughing and sneezing.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of rubella</h2>

<p>The rubella virus usually infects children 14-21 days before any symptoms appear.</p>

<p>Early rubella symptoms look like the symptoms of a mild cold. They can include fever, sore throat and swollen lymph glands in the neck.</p>

<p>After 2-3 days, a rash appears. It has pale pink spots that turn white when you press them. The rash starts on the face and spreads to the chest, stomach and back. Gradually these spots merge to form patches. The rash lasts 3-5 days before going away.</p>

<p><strong>Children with rubella are infectious for five days before and at least four days after the rash appears.</strong></p>

<h2>Risks of Rubella Infection</h2>

<p>Rubella is usually a mild illness in children that goes on its own.</p>

<p>The most serious complication from rubella infection is the harm it can cause a pregnant woman’s developing baby. If an unvaccinated pregnant woman gets infected with rubella virus she can have a miscarriage, or her baby can die just after birth. Also, she can pass the virus to her developing baby who can develop serious birth defects such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>heart problems,</li>
	<li>loss of hearing and eyesight,</li>
	<li>intellectual disability, and</li>
	<li>liver or spleen damage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Serious birth defects are more common if a woman is infected early in her pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. These severe birth defects are known as congenital rubella syndrome.</p>

<h2>Does my child need to see a doctor about rubella?</h2>

<p>Yes. You should speak to your doctor if you’re worried your child has rubella.</p>

<p>Children who have a rubella infection must be kept away from pregnant women. If you’re pregnant and think you’ve come into contact with rubella, talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife.</p>

<h2>Treatment for rubella</h2>

<p>There is no medication to treat rubella, but there are <strong>things you can do to ease your child’s symptoms</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give your child paracetamol or ibuprofen in recommended doses to help lower his fever and reduce discomfort.</li>
	<li>Encourage your child to drink plenty of water and get lots of rest.</li>
</ul>

<p>Children who have rubella should not go to child care, preschool or school until your doctor says they’re OK to go.</p>

<h2>Prevention of rubella</h2>

<p><strong>The best way to avoid rubella, and especially congenital rubella syndrome, is to have your child immunised.</strong></p>

5101,How to detect parents' perinatal difficulties,"<p>It is normal for mothers and fathers to be very emotional after the birth of a child. Hormonal changes, lack of sleep, adjustment to life with the newborn, as well as their own and others' expectations regarding their new parental role can be too demanding. The vast majority of women go through a period of sudden mood swings that are difficult to explain in the first days after giving birth.</p>","<p>The physical and mental health of the mother and father during pregnancy, and even before that period, lays the initial foundations for a young child to thrive successfully. The health system is often more focused on medical tests, such as measuring blood pressure and body weight of pregnant women and mothers, than on the mental health and well-being of the mother and her partner, such as recognizing their tension, anxiety, agitation, increased worrying, stress and depression/depressed state, thoughts and reactions.</p>

<h2>Parental mental problems </h2>

<p>They are recognized based on the following behaviors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The development of a relationship with the baby (mother's and father's ability to connect emotionally with the baby, establish a relationship, ""bond"", rejoice when they see the baby's first reactions and activities) is difficult to achieve</li>
	<li>Partner relations and relationships with other family members are changing</li>
	<li>Parents find it difficult or almost impossible to ""listen"" and respond to the baby's needs (to his/her moves and signals that he/she initially only gives by crying, and all crying seems the same to depressed parents) </li>
	<li>Parents have difficulty following and understanding what their infant can do and is capable of - according to age, as well as the stages of the child's development, his/her motivation (depressed mother or father may not understand why a one-month-old infant does not allow them to sleep through the night without interruption and may think that the infant cries deliberately)</li>
	<li>Parents are unable to see the infant in a positive light </li>
	<li>They are unable to assess what their baby needs in terms of health, safety and care</li>
	<li>They are not able to tolerate the immediate environment, are apathetic, do not show emotional reactions in contact with their child. </li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you are the mother or father of a newborn baby, if you are sad, upset, grumpy, have feelings of guilt or hopelessness for more than a couple of weeks after birth, this could indicate postpartum depression or some other perinatal mental disorder. Some women and men report not feeling any joy or excitement because of the baby's birth and no longer enjoying the things that used to please them. Although both father and mother adjust well in the beginning, problems may occur later. Postpartum depression occurs later, often between the third and sixth month after birth. <br />
Use some of the questions below to determine if there is a risk of developing perinatal difficulties:<br />
1) During the past month, have you often been bothered by low mood, depression or feelings of hopelessness?<br />
2) During the past month, have you often felt that you were not interested in anything or that you did not enjoy performing daily activities?<br />
3) Is this something you think you need help with?</p>

<p>If the answer to all three questions is YES, contact your chosen doctor.</p>

<p>Psychological and educational support during the prenatal period (before the baby's birth) can prepare mothers and fathers for parenthood, encourage realistic expectations, discuss with them how the baby will change their lives and family life, if they already have a child (children).  </p>

<h2>What can help you overcome difficulties: </h2>

<ul>
	<li>Increased family support - it can be very helpful if the spouse or another relative provides support by taking over some of the responsibilities (grocery shopping, cooking, caring for other children in the family...)</li>
	<li>The mother or father (or both) can join support groups for parents of newborn children (if available at a health center or another institution) </li>
	<li>Participation in activities organized by parenting schools, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy</li>
	<li>Physical exercises, jogging, brisk walking, taking the baby for a walk or a trip with other parents, good rest and a healthy diet.</li>
	<li>Referral of parents to the chosen doctor for a comprehensive health check, monitoring and treatment, as needed.<br />

5531,How to prepare a child for vaccination,"Vaccination is one of the most important components of the health of each of us. From the first days of life, a baby is protected from the risk of getting some forms  of the infectious diseases that exist in the environment. As long as infectious diseases exist somewhere in the world and there is a vaccine against them, it is important is to vaccinate your child. Vaccination is also a good way to maintain herd (collective) immunity to existing infectious diseases and to also to protect the population against a  new diseases that occur periodically in the world.","<p>Getting the vaccine can be painful for your child. This is why it is important that both you and your child get prepared for this event. In the first year, vaccination is frequent, and your baby is too young to understand why it is important to her, what awaits for her and how to behave. However, these explanations are very useful later. What a one-month-old baby can understand when she is getting the vaccines is your emotional readiness - your calmness, security and the sense of protection you can give her.</p>

<p>How to do it?</p>

<p>It is important that the preparation for vaccination in the first few months of life is done by a parent who has a positive attitude and who can effectively control his/her fear of the needle/injection. Your constant communication with the baby, while receiving the vaccine, messages of tenderness and love, caressing and whispering, will give her the feeling that you are with her, that she can feel safe. Your attitude will also be combined by the behaviour of the medical staff that perform these things routinely and is experienced with these procedures. In agreement with the staff, you will also find the way that is the shortest, best and most painless for you and your baby. These first experiences will project later on all subsequent experiences with vaccination, so make sure that the first experiences passes with as few emotional consequences as possible.</p>

<p>After the end of the first year, you can talk to the child and prepare for him/her before going to get the vaccine.. For some children, such as children who find it harder to adapt or have a harder time with frustrations, this pre-preparation is extremely important because it reduces the experience of stress, and thus the emotional consequences of stress due to vaccination. What many parents are already using are imitative and role-playing games, which we can call ""doctor's games"" by one name. In these games, it is especially interesting for children to give a ""bottle"" to mom and dad and other family members. They rejoice when they demonstrate power, and for you, it is an opportunity to show the child and encourage him to endure the pain without excessive reactions.</p>

<p>It is important not to hide the truth from the child during the preparation for each type of injection. Offer your child-specific strategies for coping with pain, and agree on what would be the best strategy for your child. For example, you can say, ""yes, it will hurt you, but we will blow (or we will count) and it will help us get over the pain faster"" ... or ""we will hold your hand, hold me as tight as you can while it hurts"", it will help the child to overcome the pain. Whatever you come up with and participate in together is a good strategy! The child, like all of us, usually only needs empathy for what he is going through.</p>

<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>

<p><strong>We do not advise you to use these opportunities to adopt the role of a ""matcho man"", to provoke a feeling of shame if he cries or is afraid of injections, etc. We also do not advise you to support the adoption of the role of a ""weak girl"" on this occasion, who ""can"" cry only because she is a girl. In this way, you can deprive the child of empathy and understanding, which will only intensify the reactions of fear, resistance, stress and its consequences. These seemingly banal mistakes can develop a child's fear of the doctor in general, which can permanently make it difficult to take care of your child's health.</strong></p>",1251,8,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"126, 346","4686, 5096, 5596",0,0,,en,published

5676,Sore and cracked nipples (nipple fissures),"<p>Sore and damaged nipples are a common problem, especially at the beginning of breastfeeding. They can make breastfeeding difficult, cause discomfort, and sometimes lead to giving up breastfeeding. Fortunately, there are ways to prevent this problem, and to cure it quickly and successfully if it does occur.</p>","<p>The most common cause of painful nipples is improper breastfeeding technique - poor positioning of the baby on the breast.<em><strong> </strong></em>Other causes may include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>breast engorgement</li>
	<li>infection</li>
	<li>short lingual frenulum (frenulum of the tongue)</li>
	<li>too frequent and long breastfeeding sessions (if you do not know how to calm the baby and you offer the breast as soon as he/she cries) or ""sleeping"" on the breast</li>
	<li>individual sensitivity.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Pain in the areola or nipple.</li>
	<li>After breastfeeding, the nipple is lumpy, warm, red, chafed, bleeding.</li>
	<li>The breast is sometimes swollen, enlarged, and there may be blood in the matter gagged by the baby.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>

<p>If you know the possible causes of breast fissures, you also know how you can prevent them. <em>Breastfeeding should not hurt; when you pull the nipple out of the baby's mouth, it should not be flattened and deformed. </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Check how the baby latches on the breast and correct the position if necessary</li>
	<li>Wash your hands regularly</li>
	<li>Thrush must be treated if it occurs</li>
	<li>Avoid nursing pads as they are conducive to infection</li>
	<li>After breastfeeding, wash your nipples with lukewarm water, dry them (by light tapping, without rough rubbing) and apply your breastmilk on the nipple tissue to help recovery, and then expose your breasts to air.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Put warm compresses on your breasts before breastfeeding to stimulate milk flow; the pain is strongest at the beginning of breastfeeding, until the milk starts flowing.</li>
	<li>Start each breastfeed with the breast that hurts less.</li>
	<li>Avoid limiting the frequency of breastfeeds; do not reduce the number of breastfeeds.</li>
	<li>If the damaged area bleeds severely, do not breastfeed on that breast for 1-2 days. During this time, empty it regularly by manual expression every 2-3 hours. Give the baby milk with a teaspoon.</li>
	<li>A silicone nipple shield can help relieve the pain and stop further damage to the nipple until it heals; take care of their hygiene.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these measures should lead to improvement within a few days. If the discomfort does not go away, there is still redness and pain in the form of burning or stinging, you may have a nipple infection. It is most often caused by bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) or fungi (candida), and can also be mixed. You need to see a doctor for treatment. The doctor will check if there is a problem with the baby: thrush (candidiasis) that needs to be treated or short lingual frenulum (frenulum of the tongue) that may need to be corrected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if your nipples are too painful to breastfeed the baby, you still have to express milk. If you do not empty your breasts regularly, plugged milk ducts and mastitis can occur. Irregular emptying can also lead to reduced milk production.</p>

<p>If you have questions, dilemmas or doubts about breastfeeding, call the ""Hello Baby"" telephone counseling service of the Belgrade City Institute of Public Health at 011/7158-444. The counselling nurses on phone duty (24/7) will provide you with professional assistance and advice, and help you calm down.</p>

5681,Storing breastmilk,"<p>You can keep your milk and use it when needed, so that you don't deprive your baby of the best food. Milk that is properly collected and stored does not change its properties and is safe for the infant.</p>","<p>You may find yourself away from home for several hours and unable to breastfeed your baby. You may have to work longer or travel, your older child may be sick, you may want some free time for yourself; besides, it is more and more common for mothers to be required to return to work very soon after giving birth. Your milk stored in the refrigerator or freezer does not change its nutritional properties or taste.</p>

<h2><strong>Preparation for milk storage   </strong>                                                    </h2>

<p>Storage begins with the expression process - manually or with a pump (manual or electrical). Breast pumps are excellent, because the milk is collected directly in a sterile bottle that comes with the pump, so there is no contamination with external bacteria; milk in such bottles can be stored and kept until a meal. <strong>                                                         </strong></p>

<p>Always express milk with clean hands! Wash your hands with soap and water; it is not necessary to wash your breasts before expression.<strong> </strong>Wash the milk containers with detergent in hot water, rinse them well and air dry them or use paper towels. The use of disinfectants is not recommended. Wash and disinfect the breast pump according to the manufacturer's instructions. To store milk, use hard plastic or glass containers with a tight lid, or bags specifically designed to store breastmilk. Plastic containers are better than glass ones for preserving all the milk ingredients.  Plastic used for baby bottles should not contain harmful bisphenols! Disposable plastic bottles or urine culture containers are not recommended, because their chemical safety is not reliable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proper storage of milk is extremely important in order to preserve the nutritional and anti-infective properties of breastmilk and prevent contamination with external bacteria. Milk can only be used if stored properly!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Storing freshly expressed breastmilk</strong></h2>

<p>At room temperature: OPTIMALLY NO MORE THAN 4 HOURS. If you will not use the milk for a long time, it is best to keep it in the refrigerator. In the refrigerator: 24 to 72 hours; not in the door, but further inside, where the temperature is constant and does not exceed 5ᵒC. If you plan to store milk longer, it is best to freeze it.</p>

<p>Cold milk is heated in warm water by immersing a bottle of milk in a bowl of hot water. You can also use a bottle warmer.  Expressed breast milk is not homogenized, so it is normal for it to separate into two parts - fat and water. Before checking the temperature, shake the container with the milk to distribute the fat in the milk.</p>

<p>NEVER heat breastmilk in the microwave or directly on the stove. High temperature destroys some valuable ingredients, and the child may get burnt with unevenly heated milk from the microwave oven.</p>

<h2><strong>Freezing milk</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>You can freeze expressed milk. To avoid discarding unused milk unnecessarily and to facilitate thawing and heating, store it in containers of 30 to 120 ml.</li>
	<li>Before storing it, mark the milk collection date on the containers. Milk expressed during multiple sessions during the day can be combined in one container.</li>
	<li>Avoid adding freshly expressed milk to milk that has already been cooled or frozen - you need to cool the new milk first before adding it to the milk expressed beforehand.</li>
	<li>If you use bags, keep them in a closed plastic container, to avoid absorbing the smells of other food from the freezer.</li>
	<li>You can also use milk prepared in this way to prepare baby purées when the time comes.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Storing milk in the freezer</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Compartment in the refrigerator: <strong>up to two weeks</strong></li>
	<li>Vertical freezer with a separate door: <strong>3-4 months</strong></li>
	<li>Freezer with constant deep freezing at -19 °C: <strong>up to 6 months</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Smell of frozen milk</h2>

<p>Frozen milk, as well as that stored in the refrigerator, may have a smell different from fresh milk, due to the process of fat decomposition under the influence of enzymes from milk. There is no evidence that babies tend to refuse this milk because of the smell.</p>

<h2><strong>Defrosting milk</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>You can slowly thaw the milk in the fridge (it takes about 12 hours; put it in the fridge the night before you plan to use it). Avoid leaving frozen milk at room temperature to thaw.</li>
	<li>If you need faster thawing, you can put the container with frozen milk under a stream of water (first cold, and then gradually increase water temperature).</li>
	<li>Thawed milk can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours after it is completely thawed, and at room temperature for a maximum of 2 hours. Once thawed, do not refreeze milk!</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Transport of expressed milk</strong></h2>

<p>Use a heat-insulated cooling bag and cooling cartridges to transport expressed milk. You can transport fresh or frozen milk. As soon as you arrive at your destination, transfer the milk to the refrigerator. If frozen milk has thawed, use it within four hours and do not freeze it again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These recommendations apply to the storage of milk for a healthy baby born at term, for use at home. If your baby was born preterm and/or hospitalized, be sure to consult a doctor for guidelines on how to store milk in that case!  <strong><em>       </em></strong></p>

5686,Responsive breastfeeding - responding to the child's needs,"<p>Feed your baby whenever he/she shows signs of hunger, don't wait for him/her to start crying inconsolably. Follow the signals your baby sends you and let him/her suckle whenever he/she wants, without limiting the number or length of breastfeeds. This will satisfy the child's needs, whether it is hunger or thirst.</p>","<p>When you breastfeed your baby responsively, rather than according to a set schedule, lactation is established faster and more milk is produced. The risk of neonatal jaundice, breast engorgement and mastitis is reduced. This approach ensures successful breastfeeding: breastfeed your baby without supplementation for the first six months and continue after the introduction of other foods, at least until the end of the first year.</p>

<h2><strong>Signals the baby sends when hungry:</strong></h2>

<p>He/she begins to fidget, opens his/her mouth, turns his/her head from side to side as if looking for something; this is the baby's way of telling you “I am hungry, feed me”.</p>

<p>This is followed by stretching, more intense movements, putting the hand in the mouth; the message is ""I'm really hungry now"".</p>

<p>Don’t wait for the baby to start crying inconsolably; the message is ""Calm me down, then let me suckle"".</p>

<h2><strong>What is ""normal"" newborn behavior?</strong></h2>

<p>There is no simple answer to this question, because every child is different. While rooming in together from birth, with the help and support from the staff, you will get to know your baby, learn to interpret his/her signals and respond to them.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A newborn wants to suckle approximately every one to three hours in the first seven days, but it can be more frequent.</li>
	<li>Sometimes the child often asks to suckle (cluster breastfeeding) for several hours, which the mother may interpret as not having enough milk or having another problem.</li>
	<li>When milk comes in, it is usual to have 8-12 breastfeeds in 24 hours.</li>
	<li>The interval between some breastfeeds can be longer.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding at night is important, especially in the beginning, to ensure sufficient stimulation for milk production.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone may tell you that frequent breastfeeding can cause nipple fissures. Painful and damaged nipples are the result of poor latching on the breast, not too frequent or too long breastfeeds. If the baby latches on the breast well, there will be no difficulties if he/she suckles for a long time or often.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>It is not always possible to let the child decide when and how much to suckle</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>When breastfeeds are very long (most breastfeeds last longer than 40 minutes), or very short (most breastfeeds last shorter than 10 minutes), or very frequent (more than 12 breastfeeds in 24 hours), check whether the baby latches on the breast properly, whether there is major weight loss or any health problem.</li>
	<li>If the baby is drowsy or weak due to preterm birth, low weight or jaundice, it is sometimes necessary to encourage him/her to suckle or feed him/her expressed breastmilk from a cup, until he/she is stronger.</li>
	<li>If your breasts are engorged and painful, wake up the newborn to suckle more often, and thus help both him/herself and you.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to wake up a sleeping baby to suckle?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Uncover and unwrap the child to allow him/her to move his arms and legs freely;</li>
	<li>Breastfeed your baby in an upright or semi-sitting position, not lying down;</li>
	<li>Gently massage the child and talk to him/her;</li>
	<li>If the child is still sleepy, wait for half an hour and try again;</li>
	<li>Avoid painful interventions such as pinching the cheeks or tapping the child's feet.</li>

5691,Breastfeeding while traveling,"<p>""It's easiest to travel with a baby who is still sucking. The food is always there, at the right temperature, hygienically safe, and you can feed the baby at any time. ""</p>","<p>During the trip, you will breastfeed your baby the way you breastfed him/her until then. However, before you leave, it is good to prepare and inform yourself.</p>

<h2><strong>Traveling by car</strong></h2>

<p>It is easiest to travel by car with a small child. Traveling with a baby is much easier than when the child is older. While driving, your child must always be in an age-appropriate safety seat.<strong> </strong>When it's time to breastfeed, take a break.</p>

<h2><strong>Traveling by plane</strong></h2>

<p>During the take-off and landing, due to the change in air pressure, we feel pressure on the ears (eardrums). Your baby may be agitated and cranky because of this. Breastfeeding will help him/her reduce discomfort and pain. Your baby must have a infant seat belt during breastfeeding.</p>

<p>If you plan to bring your expressed breastmilk, check with the airline whether there are any restrictions on bringing liquids on the plane; follow the recommendations for storing and transporting expressed breastmilk.</p>

<h2><strong>Breastfeeding in other countries</strong></h2>

<p>If you are traveling abroad, it is helpful to find out about views on breastfeeding in the destination country. You can get information online or from a travel agency.</p>

<p>Breastfeeding in public is acceptable in most countries, but in some countries the mother is expected to be covered while breastfeeding; bring a scarf or blanket to cover yourself while breastfeeding your baby.</p>

<h2><strong>Reduced amount of milk</strong></h2>

<p>During the trip, you may notice that the amount of milk decreases, due to stress, fatigue, dehydration. What you need to do to prevent this:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rest as much as possible, including during the day</li>
	<li>Drink plenty of fluids, preferably water</li>
	<li>Eat regularly, more often than usual</li>
	<li>Avoid coffee, tea and other caffeinated beverages</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Medications and breastfeeding</strong></h2>

<p>If you are taking any medications during the trip, for nausea, leg swelling or for other reasons, consult your doctor about whether it is safe to take them while breastfeeding.</p>

<h2><strong>Breastfeeding at the seaside</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Cold sea water will not affect breastfeeding, nor does sea water contain any ingredients that would affect breastmilk production.</li>
	<li>You will enjoy swimming even more than usual; it will alleviate the back pain that every mother feels, and it can also contribute to the loss of any excess weight.</li>
	<li>Sunbathing has no effect on breastfeeding; take care that your breasts or areolas do not get sunburned, because it can be very painful.</li>
	<li>Sunscreens do not enter the bloodstream in larger quantities; nevertheless, using a herbal one is recommended. When applying the sunscreen, be careful not to apply it on the areas from which the baby could ingest it.</li>
	<li>Do not use self-tanning products during breastfeeding</li>
	<li>After swimming, change out of your wet bathing suit; the moisture retained around the nipples in a synthetic suit is conducive to the development of fungal infections (thrush).</li>
	<li>If you are breastfeeding on the beach, wash your breasts with fresh water before breastfeeding to wash away sweat, sand and sea salt. Sit comfortably in the shade with your baby, if it will make you feel more comfortable, cover yourself with a light scarf.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Do I need to breastfeed my baby more often during the summer vacation?</strong></h2>

<p>In summer heat, babies also have an increased need for fluids. An exclusively breastfed baby gets water only from breastmilk, so he/she needs to be offered to suckle more often. The child him/herself will ask to suckle more often; don't be surprised if these feeds are short; your baby is thirsty, not hungry, so foremilk, with a higher water content, is enough. If your child is already getting solid food, after the age of 6 months, give him/her water to drink more often.</p>",11366,1,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49",59,60,"146, 2686","5681, 5726",0,0,"<p>CDC.

5696,Breastfeeding during pregnancy,"<p>“You breastfeed your baby and find out you are pregnant. You don't want to stop breastfeeding too soon, but you are concerned about how pregnancy affects breastfeeding and how breastfeeding affects pregnancy. There is no evidence that breastfeeding can endanger a pregnancy that proceeds without complications. Pregnancy does not affect the quantity and quality of milk. ""</p>","<p>You are pregnant and still breastfeeding your older child. You wonder if you should stop breastfeeding, if enough milk is still produced, what is the impact of breastfeeding on the unborn child. Sometimes the mother, or the child, decides to gradually stop breastfeeding during pregnancy. Some, however, continue throughout the pregnancy, especially if the baby is still young and the pregnancy is unplanned.</p>

<p>Breastfeeding partly protects against the next pregnancy, but every woman's body is different. Some women get pregnant easily while still breastfeeding. To protect yourself from unplanned pregnancy, consult your gynecologist about what contraceptive method is recommended during breastfeeding.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in this situation, you will have many questions and dilemmas. Sometimes health workers' advice will be different; be careful and think thoroughly if someone advises you to stop breastfeeding, especially if your baby is only a few months old.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the impact of breastfeeding on the unborn child?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>There is a concern that the unborn child will not get enough of the food he/she needs. It seems that the unborn baby's needs come first, and that he/she gets everything he/she needs if the mother's diet is regular and of good quality.</li>
	<li>Caution is advised if the mother has previously had a miscarriage or preterm birth, although the probability of this happening due to breastfeeding is low.</li>
	<li>Another dilemma is whether the new baby will get enough colostrum. It seems that the breast automatically starts producing colostrum towards the end of pregnancy. The taste of colostrum (more salty than mature milk) can help wean the older child.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How does a pregnant woman feel while breastfeeding?</strong></h2>

<p>Breastfeeding during pregnancy can have various side effects. Some mothers report that their morning sickness exacerbates during breastfeeds, probably due to hormone secretion, hunger, thirst or fatigue. Your nipples may become hypersensitive owing to pregnancy hormones; pay attention to a good breastfeeding position and good latching on the breast.</p>

<h2><strong>Is enough milk still produced?</strong></h2>

<p>If your baby is under nine months old, you eat well and offer the baby to suckle whenever he/she wants, there are good chances of maintaining the required amount of milk. Sometimes pregnancy hormones reduce milk production; you should consult a doctor in any case.</p>

<h2><strong><a href=""http://trudnocaizdravlje.rs/prekid-dojenja-koliko-dugo-dojiti-dete-nagli-prekid-dojenja-lekovi-za-prekid-dojenja-trudnoca-i-zdravlje/"">Stop breastfeeding</a> or not?</strong></h2>

<p>If you decide to stop breastfeeding, try to do it gradually. Sometimes your baby decides to stop breastfeeding him/herself; it is normal to feel guilty for speeding up this process by getting pregnant, or to regret the loss of this special connection you had with your child. Try to focus on the new baby and the relationship you will all have together. Your second and subsequent pregnancies are a special period. You will feel more confident in your role as a mother, because you have already successfully given birth and breastfed your child.</p>

<h2><strong>Tandem breastfeeding</strong></h2>

<p>Tandem breastfeeding means breastfeeding <em>two children of different ages</em> at the same time (as opposed to breastfeeding twins). It is possible to breastfeed both children after childbirth. Sometimes, the older child, who stopped breastfeeding during pregnancy, asks to continue after the new baby's birth. Tandem breastfeeding is possible and some professional associations recommend it. The advantage is that the older child still enjoys all the nutritional and immune benefits of breastmilk, and can also help the mother if the breasts are engorged. On the other hand, the younger child may not get enough milk, or the mother's full attention and focus.</p>",4011,1,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49",59,60,"2686, 146","3341, 5721",0,0,"<p>La Leche League BG: Pregnant and breastfeeding?  (2016) <a href=""https://www.laleche.org.uk/pregnant-and-breastfeeding/"">https://www.laleche.org.uk/pregnant-and-breastfeeding/</a></p>

5701,Breastfeeding combined with formula,"<p>Formula feeding is supplemental feeding of a breastfed infant before 6 months of age (recommended duration of exclusive breastfeeding), including donor human milk (from a milk bank), infant formula or other breastmilk substitutes (e.g. glucose solution).</p>","<p>Breastfeeding has many benefits for you and your baby. However, there are situations when, in addition to your milk, the child needs a certain amount of formula. This is usually necessary if the child has a health problem (preterm birth, illness) or does not thrive enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your baby cannot suckle due to illness, but feeds on your milk, he/she is naturally fed, with all the benefits provided by breastmilk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consult a doctor or visiting nurse before giving your baby formula.<strong><em> </em></strong>Sometimes it is necessary to weigh and monitor the child more often to make sure that he/she is thriving well.<strong> </strong>It takes patience too! Seek advice on how to increase milk production and help with positioning the baby on the breast and finding a good position for breastfeeding<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Breastfeeding combined with formula is usually temporary, for a short period of time. Many mothers, especially with their first child, worry whether they have enough milk, especially if the baby cries soon after a breastfeed or the breasts seem empty. In fact, it is only in rare cases that a mother cannot produce enough milk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is important to learn how to recognize that the baby is suckling enough and to learn to interpret the baby's signals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If formula is necessary, on doctor's recommendation, consult him/her on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How many meals are needed and in what quantity</li>
	<li>How you will give the baby formula (preferably from a cup)</li>
	<li>How long you should give formula to your baby</li>
</ul>

<p>You will notice a change in the color, smell and appearance of the baby's stool.</p>

<p><strong>Risks of breastfeeding combined with formula:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Your baby will find that drinking milk from a bottle is easier than suckling, so he/she may refuse breastfeeding.</li>
	<li>The breasts can become engorged and painful, which can cause milk production to stop.</li>
	<li>The amount of milk can decrease gradually because of lack of breast stimulation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Causes and possible consequences of introducing formula while breastfeeding</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Some mothers do not feed the child in the required rhythm (initially it must be 10 to 12 times in 24 hours), they phase out night-time breastfeeds too early, they do not devote enough time to breastfeeding. </li>
	<li>Bottles and pacifies confuse the child, so their use is not recommended for the first month or two.  </li>
	<li>Unnecessary use of nipple shields.</li>
	<li>Inadequate position or poor grip of the baby.</li>
	<li>Mom sometimes feels tired, insecure, doesn't eat regularly...</li>
	<li>And then temptation comes along… Moms who are impatient fail to recognize the baby's signals and follow his/her needs, quickly give the baby formula from a bottle and are one step closer to failing in their initial goal to breastfeed the baby!  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to exclude formula?</strong></p>

<p>If the reasons why formula was introduced are no longer present or you are determined to feed your baby only your own milk: </p>

<ul>
	<li>You can gradually phase out formula.</li>
	<li>Give your baby more time to suckle and empty the breasts after breastfeeding to increase milk production.</li>
	<li>Gradually reduce the amount of formula by 10 ml per meal each day or skip a meal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be patient and do not rush the introduction of formula. Remember, some babies only compensate for the physiological weight loss in two weeks, and milk production gradually increases in line with the child's needs. If formula is necessary, it should be provided in the minimum amount to meet the baby's needs, and as briefly as possible. Unnecessary formula introduction can lead to breastfeeding failure.</p>

5706,Breastfeeding out of home,"<p>When breastfeeding your baby, you do not need preparations to be away from home. Milk is always ready, whenever you and the baby are ready. Breastfeeding in public is your choice and your child's right.</p>","<p>At home, you have established a breastfeeding rhythm with your baby, breastfeeding has become a routine and you are thinking about spending a longer time out of home. You would like a little longer family walk, shopping or coffee with a friend. Moms and their babies want to enjoy the same activities as others. If you follow modern recommendations and do not give your child any other food or fluids until the age of six months, and plan to continue breastfeeding even after the introduction of non-milk foods, then you need to breastfeed your child while you are out of home. If this is uncomfortable for you, you are bound to face numerous limitations in everyday life.</p>

<p>Something that was almost unthinkable until recently and was condemned by the public is fortunately becoming a social norm nowadays. Many supermarkets, children's stores, shopping malls have a breastfeeding corner, where you can breastfeed your baby. Mothers are sometimes embarrassed or concerned about the disapproving looks and comments, which unfortunately still persist.</p>

<h2><strong>Ten tips for making breastfeeding in public more comfortable:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>You need to know your rights. Breastfeeding in public is allowed; not only do you give your baby the best possible food, but you also show women and men who do not have children how to breastfeed. </li>
	<li>Practice in front of a mirror at home: if you are concerned that you are too naked, check in the mirror; you will see that the baby covers most of the breast, try what clothes are the most suitable.</li>
	<li>Choose clothes in which you will feel comfortable.</li>
	<li>Use a baby carrier wrap.</li>
	<li>Use a bra that can be undone easily.</li>
	<li>Choose a place that suits you. Two things are important: to be able to sit comfortably, with a backrest, and to be exposed to other people as little as possible.</li>
	<li>Turn around while positioning the baby on the breast; at that point, most of your skin is visible; when the baby starts suckling, he/she practically covers the breast.</li>
	<li>If you are uncomfortable, cover yourself with a cloth diaper or scarf, to give yourself some privacy, see the baby and let the baby sees you.</li>
	<li>Smile!</li>
	<li>Be prepared for some possible inconvenience - the restaurant manager or the shopping mall security guard might warn you. Prepare your response in advance!</li>

5711,Bottle-feeding of infants,"<p>If you are going to bottle-feed your baby, you need to follow the basic recommendations, to make sure he/she gets proper nutrition, to prevent infections and other risks associated with this way of feeding.</p>","<p>Sometimes a baby cannot suckle, so you will decide to express your milk and bottle-feed the baby. Some babies are fed formula, because for some reason you cannot breastfeed, or lactation is stopped prematurely, or you have chosen artificial feeding for your baby.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure that the milk flow out of the bottle is appropriate for the baby.          </li>
	<li>To check the milk flow, turn the filled bottle upside down.</li>
	<li>The milk should drip in quick drops, rather than flow out in a jet. If you have to shake the bottle hard for the milk to start flowing, it means that the flow is too slow.</li>
	<li>A child can fall asleep before he/she finishes his/her meal.</li>
	<li>It is normal for a small amount of milk to leak from the corners of the baby's mouth; it will stop when the child is older.</li>
	<li>If you can't find the ideal nipple, choose a faster one rather than a slower one; it is normal to try a few nipples until you find one that suits you and your baby.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How to bottle-feed the baby</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make yourself comfortable and hold the baby close to you, gently but firmly. It is better for the baby to be in a more upright position, similar to the breastfeeding position.</li>
	<li>Position the nipple between the baby's lips; he/she will open his/her mouth and start sucking.</li>
	<li>Hold the bottle at an angle so that the nipple and bottle neck are constantly filled with milk; this will prevent the baby from swallowing air.</li>
	<li>When the baby stops sucking hard or has drunk half the milk from the bottle, gently withdraw the bottle and check if he/she wants to burp; when you have tried burping, let the baby continue the meal.</li>
	<li>Change the baby's position during feeding, or at least for each feeding; this will equally stimulate the baby's senses on both sides of the body and prevent positional deformity of the head.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How much milk does a baby need? </strong>                                                                                                                    </h2>

<ul>
	<li>The number of meals and the amount of milk are determined by the baby! Different babies need different amounts of breastmilk or formula. Meals are not always evenly spaced, sometimes they are more frequent during the day, followed by a longer break.                        </li>
	<li>If you feed your baby formula, consult the table on each box. Of course, the recommended meal size for a given age will only serve as a guideline and will not necessarily suit your child.                                                                     </li>
	<li>When the child starts getting other foods, as the amount of solid food increases, the child's need for milk will decrease. </li>
	<li>The amount of formula that the child drinks will decrease when he/she switches from the bottle to the cup.</li>
	<li>At the age of 12 months, when he/she can switch to cow's milk, the child usually gets 500-600 ml of breast milk or formula daily.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Some children never drink the amount of milk recommended for their age and size. For some, this ""prescribed"" amount is insufficient. At least six wet diapers during the day, constant but not excessive weight gain, thriving and active baby mean that everything is fine. If you are concerned that your baby is not getting enough of your milk or formula, consult a doctor.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Responsive bottle feeding, according to the baby's needs</strong>                                                                                   </h2>

<ul>
	<li>Feed the baby when he/she shows that he/she is hungry, and not according to the schedule, follow the baby's signals.</li>
	<li>Do not feed the child if he/she is not hungry, merely because the formula meal is already prepared - it can result in overfeeding the child.</li>
	<li>When a child is bottle-fed, there is no difference between foremilk and hindmilk, which affects the feeling of fullness of a breastfed child. </li>
	<li>The child is often positioned in such a way that milk simply flows into the mouth, instead of active sucking; the child drinks too much milk too quickly.</li>
	<li>During feeding, observe the child to notice signs of satiety - turning away from the bottle, lazy sucking - and stop the meal on time.</li>
	<li>During feeding, hold your baby close to you, cuddle and talk to him/her; this stimulates growth and development and a stronger bond between you and your baby.</li>
	<li>The baby did not drink everything from the bottle or fell asleep during the meal.</li>
	<li>Don’t worry if the baby doesn't finish the bottle; let him/her determine how much formula or breastmilk he/she needs. </li>
	<li>If the baby falls asleep during a meal, put him/her on your shoulder, rub or pat him/her on the back and legs; changing diapers is also an effective way to wake up the baby.</li>
	<li>Wait for the baby to wake up before giving him/her the rest of the milk.                                                                  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Always throw away the rest of the milk from the bottle if more than an hour has passed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Night-time feeding</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Every baby is different. Some will be weaned off night-time feeding at four months, and some at two years of age.<strong> </strong>From 6th month of life, well thriving babies no longer need a night-time meal. Now it's just a habit, which can be more and more difficult to change, the older the child gets.</li>
	<li>If a child is bottle-fed, this is the latest age for phasing out night-time meals! Do not substitute them with juices or other sweetened drinks, to protect the baby's teeth from caries.</li>
	<li>If your baby drinks 60 ml of milk or less during the night, you can abruptly stop night-time feeding and calm the baby with your tried and tested techniques, and then put him/her back in the crib to fall asleep on his/her own.</li>
	<li>If your baby drinks more than 60 ml every night, gradually reduce the amount of milk for 5 to 7 nights and calm the baby as you usually do.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Risks of bottle-feeding in bed  </strong>            </h2>

<ul>
	<li>If your baby gets used to falling asleep with a bottle in bed, it will be harder for him/her to learn to calm down or fall asleep on his/her own.  </li>
	<li>If a child falls asleep with a bottle in his/her mouth, there is a risk of choking on milk and suffocating. Babies wake up harder if something interferes with their breathing than older children and adults.                                                                                </li>
	<li>The formula remaining in the mouth during sleep leads to dental caries.<strong>          </strong></li>
	<li>When a child drinks from a bottle lying down position, the risk of ear infection increases.</li>

5716,Feeding the baby with another woman's breastmilk,"<p>Informal sharing of human milk can be beneficial for infants and the family, but it also carries risks. The situation is different when it comes to donor human milk, which is provided by breastfeeding women through human milk banks.</p>","<p>Throughout human history, children who were deprived of their own mothers' milk were often breastfed by other women; it was known that these children had much better chances of survival than children fed with animal milk. When technological advances made it possible to produce formulas, the needs for wet nurses decreased and the children switched to artificial feeding.</p>

<p>Given the knowledge of the indispensable role of human milk for children's health, the World Health Organization and other international organizations recommend human milk, i.e. another woman's milk, as the next best choice, if their own mother's milk is not available. These are women who breastfeed their own children and are willing to collect excess milk and donate it to feed the babies who need it.</p>

<p>To feed preterm and sick children, milk banks are organized; they safely collect, process, store and stockpile the milk of their own mothers and donors. Human milk banks exist in medical centers treating preterm babies, in Belgrade and since recently, in Novi Sad.</p>

<p>Although almost all women can breastfeed, there are still a small number of mothers who do not establish lactation or who cannot breastfeed for medical reasons, due to medicines or other treatment, previous breast surgery etc.</p>

<p>Human milk banks have limited quantities of milk available. Milk from milk banks cannot be provided to healthy children who do not have access to their own mothers' milk. Another source may be ""informal sharing"" of human milk. This means that the child directly receives another woman's milk, usually from family friends or relatives; however, lately, there has also been the ""trend"" of human milk supply over the internet, which is certainly not a recommended practice.</p>

<p><strong>When making the decision to feed your child </strong>another woman's milk, you need to know:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the donor's health status</li>
	<li>whether she smokes, consumes alcohol or any drugs</li>
	<li>whether she uses any medications</li>
	<li>whether she has been tested for viruses (HIV, hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus)</li>
	<li>whether milk is collected and stored in strict compliance with hygiene measures</li>
	<li>whether it is transported appropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Responsibility for informal human milk donation lies both on the donor and on the parents who accept and use it to feed their child. If the woman donating milk is someone from your environment, a family member or friend, make sure you are well informed about her health and lifestyle. Ask her to get tested for viruses that can be transmitted through human milk and make sure that the milk is collected, stored and transported safely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pasteurization of the milk obtained in this way reduces the risk of virus transmission. If your child is preterm or sick, feeding him/her milk obtained in this way is not recommended.</p>

5721,Maternal nutrition during breastfeeding,"<p>During breastfeeding, nutrition should be balanced and meals regular. It is not necessary to eat any special food, or to completely eliminate certain foods.</p>","<p>There are many misconceptions about breastfeeding mothers' nutrition: that you need special food, that you should eat more, that there are many types of food that you should avoid.</p>

<p>Your body stores fat during pregnancy; after childbirth, milk is produced partly from these reserves, and partly from the food you eat. During the breastfeeding period, you need an additional 450-500 calories. The calorie needs are the highest in the first four to six months, while the baby is exclusively breastfed. It is enough to add three slices of bread, 100 grams of meat or poultry, one serving of fruits or vegetables, or dairy products to your daily menu.  When your baby starts taking non-milk foods, you can stop taking these ""supplements"". </p>

<p>Immediately after childbirth, the mother's diet should be light and predominantly liquid: milk, freshly squeezed fruit juices, fruit compotes, biscuits, vegetable soups. However, already in the second week after childbirth, the diet should be varied and mixed.</p>

<h2><strong>Dietary recommendations during breastfeeding</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>At least one third of the daily protein intake should be of animal origin, from fish, meat, milk and eggs. Meat also satisfies the increased needs for vitamin B, iron and zinc.</li>
	<li>Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for the development of your baby's brain and eyes. Eat oily sea fish 2-3 times a week. Good sources of healthy fatty acids also include olive and pumpkin oil, flax, sesame and pumpkin seeds.</li>
	<li>Calcium is an important ingredient in milk, necessary for the proper development of the baby's bones; it is mostly found in milk and dairy products, sardines, tofu, sesame paste.</li>
	<li>Get vitamin C from fresh fruits and vegetables, and vitamin B from whole-grain cereals and meat.</li>
	<li>Iodine is essential for babies; using iodized table salt will ensure a sufficient intake; do not over-salt food.</li>
	<li>During breastfeeding, the need for vitamins D, E and A is also increased. If you ate well during pregnancy, you created reserves of these vitamins, which are now used and passed into breastmilk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Vitamin D is produced in the skin when exposed to the sun.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give preference to fresh and cooked food, avoid frying, processed and smoked meats, as well as undercooked meat.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Certain strong-smelling foods</strong> (onions, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, spices or beans) can affect the smell and taste of breastmilk<strong> </strong>and cause anxiety in some babies. If this happens, take a break from those foods.</p>

<p><strong>Foods that can cause allergies</strong>: Excluding these foods from your diet will not reduce your baby's risk of allergies; if you avoid numerous foods, you will not be getting enough important and useful nutrients.</p>

<h2><strong>Foods or supplements that can increase milk production</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Brewer's yeast is high in B vitamins and is recommended during breastfeeding, but not in the form of beer, which contains alcohol.</li>
	<li>Oats have a positive effect on the hormones responsible for milk production. You can eat it cooked, as porridge, biscuits or oatmeal cookies.</li>
	<li>Chickpeas are traditionally used as an excellent food for breastfeeding mothers, in the form of soups, stews or spreads (hummus); cooked wheat is another excellent food.</li>
	<li>Seeds, especially sesame and flax.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fluid intake<strong> </strong>should not be forced or restricted. 3-4 extra glasses of water, preferably during breastfeeding, are usually enough to meet the increased needs. The best drink is water, and fresh fruit juices are recommended in small quantities. Eliminate carbonated and sweetened drinks, drinks containing artificial colors, flavors and sweeteners, as well as energy drinks. </p>

<p>Coffee:<strong> </strong>no more than 3 cups of coffee a day are recommended; based on your child's behavior, you will best assess the amount of coffee that will not affect the child. Caffeine is also present in energy drinks, green tea, Coca-Cola; it can lead to mood swings, nervousness, colic, as well as sleep disorders in a baby.</p>

<h2><strong>Practical tips for nutrition during breastfeeding</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Regular meals and snacks are important; find time for yourself.</li>
	<li>Don’t delay or skip breakfast, if that was your habit in the past.</li>
	<li>Eat a variety of foods, because the variety of smells and tastes in breastmilk will help your baby accept non-milk foods more easily.</li>
	<li>Fruits and vegetables are especially important, because they contain the necessary minerals and vitamins.</li>
	<li>Avoid having snacks instead of meals; also avoid ready-made foods with artificial colors, sweeteners and other additives.</li>
	<li>""Treat"" yourself to your favorite fast food only once in a while.</li>
	<li>Avoid sweet and fatty foods, as well as sweetened juices.</li>
	<li>Drink before you get thirsty. Drink a glass of water during each breastfeed; thirst is one of the symptoms of the oxytocin reflex. Drink as much fluid as you feel you need. Large amounts of fluid will not increase milk production, and may even reduce it.</li>
	<li>Vitamin B stimulates milk production. It is present in yeast and whole-grain cereals.</li>
	<li>Postpone weight loss. If you start losing weight right away and start avoiding certain foods, or eating too little, you can expect it to have a negative impact on breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>

5726,Emptying the breasts and expressing breastmilk,"<p>It is good to learn the correct technique of breast massage and milk expression already in the maternity hospital, in case you happen to need it.</p>","<p>Immediately after birth, the breasts begin to fill with milk in a small, but sufficient amount for the baby. If the baby is properly positioned on the breast, is breastfed responsively and efficiently empties the breasts, ideal conditions of supply and demand will be created (the amount of milk corresponds to the baby's needs). Milk expression will not be needed in that case. Breasts can sometimes become hard, tense and painful. All babies are born with the rooting, sucking and swallowing reflex, but some babies are ""stronger"", so they suck more efficiently immediately after birth, and some need help.</p>

<h2><strong>Expression is required:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>if the baby does not suckle enough milk from the breasts in the first days because he/she was born prematurely, with low weight, or has jaundice</li>
	<li>when you and your baby are separated due to illness</li>
	<li>in case of plugged milk ducts, damaged nipples, inflamed breasts</li>
	<li>when you want to encourage the production of more milk</li>
	<li>when you plan to be away from home for a longer period of time or have returned to work, so that the person caring for the baby can feed him/her your milk</li>
	<li>when you want to donate your milk to a breastmilk bank</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Depending on the needs, you can give the expressed milk to your child, store it in the refrigerator or freezer for later meals, transport it to the child (if the baby is in hospital or you are separated for other reasons). Follow the recommendations for keeping and storing breastmilk!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Hand expression of milk</h2>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Wash your hands with soap and water</li>
	<li>Massage will stimulate the milk ejection reflex and facilitate flow. Gently massage the breast: start from the base and move towards the nipple; do not forget the underside of the breast. Repeat several times, in order not to skip any part. The massage should be gentle, with light pressure, or tapping with the fingertips (as on piano keys).</li>
	<li>Warm compresses before the massage can also facilitate milk flow.</li>
	<li>Place the milk container (preferably a bowl with a wide opening) under the breast, between the knees or on a low table, so that both hands are free.</li>
	<li>Prepare a towel to wipe off any drops that ""escape"" or slippery, wet fingers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expression:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>You can hold the breast with your other hand, if it is large or heavy.</li>
	<li>Place your thumb and other fingers opposite each other, away from your nipple.</li>
	<li>Using your thumb and first two fingers, press first inward, toward the center of the breast; <em>expression must not be painful.</em></li>
	<li>Then gently squeeze, in rhythmic movements, as if you wanted to join the thumb and other fingers; this way, you compress the ducts and the milk starts flowing.</li>
	<li>The milk first flows out in drops, and then in a jet, when the milk ejection reflex kicks in.</li>
	<li>Rotating your thumb and forefinger around the areola will allow you to express milk from all parts of the breast.</li>
	<li>Empty the breast for 3-5 minutes, until the flow begins to decrease, then switch to the other breast. Repeat the whole procedure once more, so that the breast emptying lasts a total of 20-30 minutes.</li>
	<li>Breast emptying can be tiring; take a break and drink some water.</li>
	<li>Avoid rubbing the skin roughly and squeezing the nipple; this will lead to swelling and prevent milk flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Expressing milk with a pump</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Put warm compresses on your breasts a few minutes before pumping.</li>
	<li>Gently massage both breasts.</li>
	<li>Express some milk from both breasts.</li>
	<li>Press the pump flange and the silicone massage shield firmly on the breast.</li>
	<li>Slowly push the pump handle down, hold for a few seconds, then let go, mimicking the rhythm of sucking.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to manual pumps, there are various electrical ones. They mimic manual pumping, making the process much easier because the pump works for you. A disadvantage is their high price. Some moms find it easier to hand express their breasts, and some to use a pump. If you intend to buy a pump, consult professionals about the choice, and consider whether you need one at all.</p>

<h2><strong>The amount of milk</strong></h2>

<p>Some women find it easy to express, and some need time to learn the correct technique. The amount of milk you will get by expressing on a number of factors: the breasts, the baby's age, time of the last breastfeed, frequency of emptying your breasts. If you get only a small amount or none at all, seek help to make sure you are doing it correctly.</p>

<blockquote>

5731,When a baby refuses to breastfeed,"<p>Breast rejection is usually only a temporary phase, which is easily resolved by changing the breastfeeding position or providing a calmer environment for breastfeeding the baby, with patience and tenderness.</p>","<p>The baby may refuse only one or both breasts during a breastfeed. Also, he/she may seem hungry, but when offered the breast, he/she cannot latch on to start suckling. Or, the baby latches on the breast and starts suckling, but after a short time lets go of the breast and starts crying, because he/she cannot keep it in his/her mouth.</p>

<h2><strong>Causes of breast rejection or difficulty latching on</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The baby has a problem with latching on the breast </li>
	<li>The breastfeeding position is not correct</li>
	<li>The baby prefers one breast</li>
	<li>The breast is hard or swollen</li>
	<li>The breast releases milk during breastfeeding more slowly or faster than usual</li>
	<li>The baby just isn’t hungry</li>
	<li>The baby is used to a bottle or a pacifier</li>
	<li>The baby is tired or disturbed by excessive environmental stimulation, which is normal for older infants</li>
	<li>The baby has a cold</li>
	<li>The baby is in pain or uncomfortable</li>
	<li>Your milk tastes different, which happens if you are taking a medicine, due to hormonal changes during your cycle, or if you have eaten something unusual.</li>
	<li>You have changed your perfume or deodorant</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What can help:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Check the baby's position and how he/she latches on both breasts</li>
	<li>Keep the baby calm, close to the breast</li>
	<li>Touch the baby's lips with the nipple until he/she opens his/her mouth wide before latching on the breast</li>
	<li>Do not force the baby to latch on the breast</li>
	<li>If the baby starts crying or fidgeting, stop breastfeeding and try again in 15 minutes after the baby calms down</li>
	<li>Do not force the baby to latch on the breast when crying - breastfeeding should be associated with a feeling of comfort</li>
	<li>Take care that your breasts do not become engorged due to limited breastfeeding</li>
	<li>Express milk from the breasts to maintain lactation in both breasts</li>
	<li>If necessary, express some milk before breastfeeding to prevent milk from flowing into the baby's mouth too quickly</li>
	<li>If the baby refuses both breasts, feed him/her expressed milk with a teaspoon, cup or syringe</li>
	<li>Feed your baby with your milk until he/she links breastfeeding with a feeling of satisfaction</li>
	<li>Avoid bottle nipples and pacifies, feed the child with a cup if necessary</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding should take place in an intimate atmosphere, without additional stimulation</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding should be preceded by cuddling with the baby</li>
	<li>Do not use perfumed creams or deodorants</li>
</ul>

5736,When milk comes in later - delayed lactation,"<p>If the expected increase in the amount of milk does not occur in the first 72 hours after birth, delayed lactation is considered to have occurred. An estimated 5-10% of women (maybe even 25%) have delayed lactation.</p>","<h2><strong>Milk coming in after childbirth</strong></h2>

<p>When a baby is born, you already have colostrum in your breasts; sometimes you are not even aware of it, because milk does not leak. The amount of milk normally increases 30-40 hours after birth. The timing of milk production onset is different for each mother; 2-3 days after birth, milk production is usually established, but in as many as 25% of mothers, this happens after the third day. The key prerequisite is breast stimulation, i.e. early initiation of breastfeeding.<strong> </strong>During the first day after birth, 10-50 ml of milk is produced; in the following days, the amount increases and colostrum changes to mature milk.</p>

<h2><strong>The two key hormones for breastfeeding are prolactin and oxytocin.</strong></h2>

<p>Baby's suckling is the driving force for the secretion of hormones, through sensory impulses from the nipple.</p>

<p><em>Prolactin</em> is secreted during breastfeeding to provide milk for the next breastfeed. More prolactin is secreted at night, so night-time breastfeeds are especially important in the beginning. <em>Oxytocin</em> acts before and during a breastfeed to allow milk to flow out of the breast (milk ejection reflex).  It causes uterine contractions and thus reduces the risk of bleeding and infection after childbirth. These contractions - afterpains - can be very painful during breastfeeding, especially in multiparous women.</p>

<h2><strong>The supply and demand principle</strong></h2>

<p><strong>After the initial hormonal</strong> phase of milk production, further regulation mainly takes place locally, based on the supply and demand principle. The baby's efficient suckling and breast emptying are key. Without efficient suckling and removal of milk, milk production is reduced. Thanks to this principle, women who have very small breasts (low glandular tissue) can provide their baby with enough milk by breastfeeding often; the same goes for twins.</p>

<h2><strong>How to recognize that milk is coming in?</strong></h2>

<p>Fullness of the breasts, feeling of heaviness, heat, tingling, milk leakage tell you that the milk has ""come in"". You may need a few days to recognize the signs of milk coming in. You may be afraid of the sudden change that is happening to you. If you empty your breasts, you will notice a gradual change in color, from thick and yellow colostrum, to thinner and whiter mature milk.</p>

<h2><strong>When milk comes in later - delayed lactation</strong></h2>

<p>The most common causes of ""delays"" in milk coming in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In primiparous women, milk comes in on average one day later than in multiparous women</li>
	<li>Prolonged childbirth, stress and pain, unplanned caesarean section</li>
	<li>Higher blood loss during childbirth or retained placental tissue</li>
	<li>Late initiation of breastfeeding</li>
	<li>Premature birth</li>
	<li>Maternal diseases - obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, elevated blood pressure</li>
	<li>Bad habits - smoking, alcohol consumption</li>
	<li>Breast surgeries</li>
	<li>Nipple problems: flat or inverted nipples, piercing</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to do if there is no milk for 4 days:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Breasts should be emptied regularly and completely. Skin-to-skin contact can help increase milk production.</li>
	<li>The newborn's weight should be monitored daily to assess whether the baby is getting enough milk.</li>
	<li>On discharge from the maternity hospital, you will receive recommendations on any supplemental feeding and further monitoring of the child's thriving.</li>
	<li>Weighing the child on a daily basis is not particularly beneficial, especially not in improvised conditions at home. It can only confuse you, and sometimes it's not even safe! It is not advisable to weigh the baby before and after a breastfeed, to estimate the amount of milk suckled. Breastfeeds differ in duration, especially in the beginning; sometimes the child suckles from only one breast, sometimes from both, so one breastfeed does not provide a realistic insight into the efficiency of suckling.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If your baby needs supplementation, provide it in a way and in an amount that will not interfere with breastfeeding progress. If the beginning is difficult, remember that many mothers managed to gradually increase milk production to the full amount needed by the child within a week or two, and some even after several weeks.</p>

5751,How to increase milk production,"<p>The most common reason for insufficient milk production is poor breast emptying due to incorrect positioning, incorrect breastfeeding and latching, too many short breastfeeds or insufficiently frequent breastfeeding, breastfeeding according to a set schedule, instead of responsive breastfeeding, according to the baby's needs.</p>","<p>Breast emptying and milk production are related. If the breast is not emptied to a sufficient extent, milk production will decrease. When a baby suckles efficiently, there will usually be enough milk. If the child does not suckle enough on the breast because he/she was born preterm, with low weight or is sick, breast stimulation is also missing. Psychological factors, pain, stress, lack of support from the partner and family have an impact equal to medical or ""technical"" problems with breastfeeding.</p>

<h2><strong>How to increase milk production</strong></h2>

<p>Improve breastfeeding technique.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Good grip and latching on the breast allow the baby to suckle efficiently and get more milk.</li>
	<li>In this way, the breast is stimulated to produce more milk and meet the baby's needs.</li>
	<li>Some children thrive well even when latching is not optimal, because the mother initially produces a lot of milk. If the baby does not stimulate the breast enough, milk production may decrease in the coming months. Your baby will then become restless while on the breast, may completely refuse to suckle, or breastfeeds may be very short, because milk flow does not meet his/her needs.</li>
	<li>To prevent this, try to improve your baby's grip and latching on the breast right at the beginning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Help your baby by squeezing milk out.</p>

<p>This can improve milk flow and help the baby suckle longer. If your baby quickly falls asleep on the breast, good positioning on the breast followed by breast compression will stimulate milk flow. The baby will start suckling and wake up as the milk comes in. Squeeze your breast between your thumb and fingers, as far away from your nipple as possible; the pressure should be strong enough, but not painful. Squeeze while the baby is suckling, rest when the baby is resting. If your baby suckles vigorously and actively, there is no need to squeeze milk out.</p>

<h2>Feed your baby often and well</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Increase the frequency of breastfeeds to 8-12, and more if necessary; don’t forget night-time breastfeeding;</li>
	<li>Do not set the spacing and length of breastfeeds, leave it to the baby.</li>
	<li>Make sure the baby is in a good position.</li>
	<li>Don't wait for the breasts to ""fill up"" for the baby to eat. There is always milk for the baby, even when they seem empty. Moreover, if the baby suckles more often, not only will the amount of milk increase in a few days, but the baby will also gain more weight because he/she will eat more of the hindmilk, which is more nutritious.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeds must be not only more frequent, but also more efficient. A baby who is not lively and does not suckle efficiently, but sleeps with a nipple in his/her mouth, should be encouraged by skin-to-skin contact, unwrapping (in a warm room, of course), or carrying in a carrier during breastfeeding.</li>
	<li>Addition of any tea or formula can disrupt the supply-demand relationship in breastmilk production.</li>
	<li>Empty the breast after a breastfeed. In some breastfeeds, the baby eats up everything and wants more, in some not. This happens in specific cases when the baby is nervous about something, when his/her teeth erupt, when the mother changes her deodorant and the like. After the baby no longer wants to suckle, even after stimulation (skin-to-skin contact, carrying), empty the breast after breastfeeding by expressing for another 2 minutes after the last drop of milk has flown out.</li>
	<li>Drink plenty of fluids. Not too much, but enough: about one glass during one breastfeed.</li>
	<li>Rest. This is especially possible if you breastfeed often, so you are compelled to sit or lie down with the baby often. In addition to breastfeeding, it would be good to find something that mentally relaxes you, at least for a few minutes a day.</li>
	<li>Follow some of these tips and wait a day or two. This may seem like a very long time, but as the methods are based on many other mothers' experience and the latest scientific knowledge, there is no reason why you shouldn't believe in your own success. Relax, enjoy being with your baby and believe in yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Breastfeeding crisis or lactation crisis    </strong>             </h2>

<p>There are situations when it may seem that the baby's needs exceed what you can offer. This especially happens in the afternoon/evening or for a few days during the baby's developmental leaps, i.e. phases of increased feeding needs. These are normal stages that all babies go through (some sooner, some later, with different intensity), usually at the age of 2-3 weeks, 6 weeks or around 3 months. Avoid the mistake of introducing supplementation or giving up breastfeeding! Periods of such increased needs are stressful for both you and the baby, but they pass quickly.</p>

<p>If the mother feels that her breasts are empty or notices that they are smaller than in the previous days and weeks, it does not mean that there is no milk!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think of yourself too:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do you have regular meals and drink enough fluids?</li>
	<li>Do you manage to balance baby care with your other responsibilities?</li>
	<li>Do you manage to relax and rest during the day?</li>

5756,The amount of milk needed,"<p>Every mother's greatest fear is whether she has enough milk for her child and whether he/she is thriving well. This has turned out to be one of the most common reasons for the (unnecessary) introduction of supplementary feeding, and even complete transition to artificial feeding.</p>","<h2><strong>The baby is probably getting enough milk when he/she:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>suckles at least 8-12 times in a day;</li>
	<li>suckles rhythmically with short pauses, chin movements can be seen, swallowing can be heard;</li>
	<li>wets his/her diapers 6 or more times in 24 hours with pale, diluted urine;</li>
	<li>usually has 3-6 stools in 24 hours;</li>
	<li>gains an average of 150-240 g per week for the first 4 months;</li>
	<li>is active, lively between breastfeeds.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Your baby may not have his/her needs for milk met if he/she:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>sleeps in long intervals to conserve energy (more than 4 hours);</li>
	<li>cries in a weak voice;</li>
	<li>has a small number of scarce stools, or none at all;</li>
	<li>suckles too frequently;</li>
	<li>is not gaining enough weight;</li>
	<li>urinates too little - fewer than 6 wet diapers, diapers are not heavy, urine is concentrated, a brick-colored trace of urate salts can be seen.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Physiological weight loss</strong></h2>

<p>In the first days after birth, it is normal for a newborn to lose weight. This is due to the passing of the first stool/meconium and excess free fluid. The amount of free water is higher if the mother received an IV drip during childbirth or due to a caesarean section; these babies may experience a greater weight loss in the first 24 hours. A newborn's stomach is small - the size of a cherry in the first days.</p>

<p>All this leads to the loss of 7% of birth weight, on average. The maximum physiological weight loss is 10%. If the child has lost 10% or more, it is necessary to check the breastfeeding technique, whether he/she suckles actively, whether he/she has a health problem, and only if all these causes are ruled out and the child does not start gaining weight, supplementation should be considered. If your baby had a greater weight loss in the first few days, it is advisable to stay in the maternity hospital for a few more days to get the necessary help and support for breastfeeding; after discharge, it is necessary to further monitor the child and check the weight after 5 to 7 days.</p>

<h2>Weight gain</h2>

<ul>
	<li>When lactation is established and breastfeeding starts well, the child begins to gain an average of 25 to 30 grams per day. Return to birth weight is expected between 10th and 15th day of life.</li>
	<li>The thriving norm is a minimum of 600 g per month. Of course, some children gain much more weight; if the baby only suckles, you should not be concerned about excessive weight gain.</li>
	<li>If the baby gained between 400 and 600 g, additional monitoring is needed and breastfeeding progress should be checked in 7 days; with breastfeeding correction, a weight gain of at least 180 g in one week is expected.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Obstacles you can overcome</strong></h2>

<p>Breastfeeding challenges mainly occur in the beginning. Consider:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You may not feed your baby often enough (initially, it must be as frequent as 10 to 12 times in 24 hours), you phased out night-time breastfeeding too early, you do not devote enough time to breastfeeding.</li>
	<li>Bottles and pacifiers confuse the child, so their use is not recommended for the first month or two.</li>
	<li>Unnecessary use of nipple shields and incorrect breastfeeding also interfere with the optimal establishment of lactation.                    </li>
	<li>The first months of parenthood are accompanied by insecurity, great fatigue, inadequate diet.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then temptations come along: if you are impatient and do not have enough self-confidence, you will introduce formula, and you will be one step closer to losing the initial desire to exclusively breastfeed and giving up!  The bottle can compromise milk production to such an extent that it stops completely. In that case, returning to exclusive breastfeeding is not so easy!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try to make sure you get enough sleep, rest and relaxation. Suggest to your friends and family to give you an hour or two of babysitting instead of gifts for the baby, so that you could go for a walk, coffee or to the hairdresser's. </p>

<p>Don’t let anyone persuade you that formula is just as good for your baby as your milk!!</p>

5761,Breastfeeding and alcohol consumption,<p>It is safest not to consume alcohol at all while breastfeeding. The effect of alcohol on the baby is proportional to the amount drunk by the mother.</p>,"<p>The concentration of alcohol in breastmilk is equal to that in blood. After 30-60 minutes of drinking alcohol, it will be present in breastmilk. In order for alcohol to disappear from breastmilk, it takes approximately 2 hours for 1 drink, 4 hours for 2, 6 hours for 3. The effect also depends on the mother's body weight, the amount of adipose tissue, whether the alcohol is taken on an empty stomach or with food.</p>

<p>Pregnant women are generally warned that alcohol use during pregnancy can harm the unborn child; less is known about the effects of alcohol on the baby during breastfeeding. Consumption of a larger amount of alcohol can cause drowsiness, deep sleep, weakness in the child, and reduced milk flow in the mother.</p>

<h2><strong>Facts you need to know</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The newborn has immature liver functions, so he/she is more sensitive to alcohol</li>
	<li>During the first three months of life, a child metabolizes alcohol twice as slowly as an adult</li>
	<li>Your weight affects alcohol metabolism: heavier people break down faster than lower-weight ones</li>
	<li>The effect of alcohol is directly proportional to the amount you drink; the more you drink, the more time your body will need to metabolize it</li>
	<li>If you consume alcohol with food, a smaller amount will be absorbed</li>
	<li>It is not necessary to empty the breast, because alcohol is not retained in breastmilk</li>
	<li>A large amount of liquid or coffee will not speed up the rate of alcohol elimination from your body, and therefore from breastmilk</li>
</ul>

<p>It may seem to you that an absolute ban on alcohol consumption during breastfeeding (which can last up to two years) is an excessive restriction. You may find a slightly more flexible approach more acceptable; one alcoholic beverage on a special occasion, with the above precautions (a two-hour break between alcohol consumption and breastfeeding), will not harm the baby.</p>

	<li>the degree of ankyloglossia (appearance and mobility of the tongue)</li>
	<li>the extent to which ankyloglossia affects suckling efficiency</li>
</ul>

<p>While the baby is suckling, the tongue should be over the lower gums in the lower jaw. If he/she can't move the tongue enough or keep it in the correct position, the baby will chew instead of suckling. Breastfeeding can be painful and lead to nipple damage, and in some cases the baby will not suckle enough and gain weight.</p>

<h2><strong>Frenectomy (tongue-tie release)</strong></h2>

<p>The frenulum removal procedure is simple; in infants, it can be performed without anesthesia and with few complications<em> . </em>The laser method is suitable for precision. absence of bleeding, pain, and wound suturing.<em> </em>If it is necessary, it is advisable to have it performed as early as possible, in the first months of life. After frenectomy, mothers report that the baby latches on the breast better and suckles better already after 48 hours, and mothers who previously complained of sore nipples report that they no longer feel pain. After the procedure, a period of baby's adjustment to the new way of suckling is needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A short frenulum is usually not a serious problem and does not require treatment; tongue mobility improves over time and the problem can resolve itself. It is sometimes hastily assessed that surgery is needed and suggested to parents already in the maternity hospital. It is better to wait a month or two, unless the baby has difficulties suckling and breastfeeding is painful for the mother.</p>

5771,Mastitis and breast abscess,"<p>Mastitis is breast inflammation that leads to local tenderness, redness and fever. Milk flow from the affected breast is difficult. Fever, dizziness, malaise and headache may also occur.</p>","<p>If mastitis is not recognized at an early stage, it can turn into an abscess (formation of a local purulent collection). The area of the breast with the abscess is hot, painful, full of fluid, swollen or a purulent discharge may appear.</p>

<p>There is no consensus among experts on whether the term mastitis always means a bacterial infection; it is certainly always an inflammatory process. The most common cause of acute mastitis is pyogenic staphylococcus, which produces toxins responsible for symptoms such as fever, chills, malaise, and in the most severe cases, breast abscess. Mastitis can also be caused by fungi, especially if the child has oral thrush. During acute mastitis, you may feel very bad; you will quickly get much better with proper treatment.</p>

<p>It most often occurs in the first weeks after childbirth, although it can occur at any time during lactation. Unlike breast engorgement and plugged milk ducts, mastitis occurs in one breast!</p>

<h2><strong>Causes of mastitis</strong></h2>

<p> All the factors that lead to breast engorgement also contribute to the development of mastitis.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cracked nipples.</li>
	<li>An infection that is transmitted from the nipple through the milk ducts into the breast.</li>
	<li>Improperly emptied or untreated plugged milk ducts.</li>
	<li>Infection in the baby's mouth.</li>
	<li>Sudden interruption of breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Treatment of mastitis</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Contact your doctor and use medications against infection, pain and fever on the doctor's advice.</li>
	<li>Antibiotic treatment is necessary if the mother has a fever for more than 24 hours, if symptoms persist after 24 hours of frequent and efficient breastfeeding or breast emptying, if the mother's condition deteriorates.</li>
	<li>Do not stop breastfeeding (unless recommended by the doctor).</li>
	<li>Make sure the baby is correctly positioned on the breast and correct the position if necessary.</li>
	<li>After each breastfeed, express milk from the affected breast.</li>
	<li>Apply cold compresses after expressing for up to 15 minutes every hour.</li>
	<li>Rest as much as possible until the infection recedes, but without interrupting breastfeeding (the mother is resting, not the breast!).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If mastitis recurs, the same region is always affected, redness and swelling do not pass, consider the presence of an abscess (ultrasound examination of the breast is recommended and, based on the findings, consult a surgeon). If an abscess occurs, surgical treatment (incision and drainage) is necessary.</p>

5776,Thrush (candidiasis),<p>Thrush or candidiasis is a fungal disease that most often occurs in a child's mouth. It is common in the first year of life and is usually not a reason for concern.</p>,"<p>Thrush is caused by the fungus Candida albicans. We all have this fungus in our bodies, living in balance with other organisms; when this balance is disturbed, an infection occurs.</p>

<p>Your baby can become infected by sucking on objects that contain the fungus, such as bottle nipples, pacifiers, toys, as well as your nipples. Most babies born naturally encounter candida at birth, because it is normally present in small numbers in the vagina.</p>

<p>Sometimes antibiotic treatment given to a child can lead to the appearance of thrush.</p>

<h2><strong>Signs of infection</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The baby has white patches on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity or a rash in the diaper region</li>
	<li>The baby usually has no symptoms; if thrush spreads, he/she may refuse breastfeeding or food due to irritation; salivation is increased</li>
	<li>If you have infection - infected nipples may look normal or be red and irritated</li>
	<li>Nipple infection is accompanied by a feeling of deep stabbing pain and you notice that your nipples ""burn"" or ""sting"" after breastfeeding</li>
</ul>

<p>The changes first occur on the baby’s tongue; unlike leftover milk, they cannot be easily removed. If the infection spreads to the inside of the cheeks and lips, small white spots can be seen (as if sprinkled with semolina).</p>

<h2><strong>Mother's treatment</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>On doctor's advice, use antifungal medications</li>
	<li>After each breastfeed, wash the nipples with warm water, air dry and expose to the sun</li>
	<li>Before each breastfeed, wipe the nipples with a baking soda solution</li>
	<li>Wash your hands before and after breastfeeding and changing your baby</li>
	<li>Wear cotton bras that you can machine wash at 95 °C</li>
	<li>Do not use nursing pads, as fungi ""like"" a humid environment</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Baby treatment</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>On doctor's advice, use an antifungal medication (drops or oral gel). It is applied after a meal, for 10 days</li>
	<li>Carefully remove the deposits from the baby's mouth with a baking soda solution (1 teaspoonful per 100 ml of boiled and cooled water), by wrapping gauze around your finger, dipping it in the solution and gently running it over the tongue, gums and mucous membranes inside the baby's cheeks half an hour to an hour before a meal</li>
</ul>

<p>While the baby is suckling, the infection is transmitted from his/her mouth to the nipple (and vice versa), so it is important to treat both mom and baby.</p>

<h2><strong>How to prevent thrush</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Sterilize bottle nipples, nipple shields, spoon</li>
	<li>Wash the toys that the child puts in his/her mouth</li>
	<li>Wash your hands before and after breastfeeding and changing your baby</li>
	<li>If your baby has a diaper rash, treat it</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Take the child to a doctor if thrush spreads in the mouth, if the baby refuses to suckle or eat other foods, if he/she has a fever, or if thrush persistently recurs. Seek medical advice if you experience persistent pain in the form of burning or stinging in the nipples or deep, stabbing pain in the breasts.</p>

5781,Infant formulas,<p>Infant formulas are the only safe choice for children who do not get breastmilk. Using appropriate infant formula is recommended during the first 12 months; you can start giving cow's milk to your child when he/she is one year old.</p>,"<p>Not all children have the privilege of getting their mother's breastmilk! There are few women who have a contraindication to breastfeeding or who simply do not have breastmilk (less than 5%). It is more often the case that you are compelled to temporarily or permanently stop breastfeeding and give your baby formula due to illness, admission to hospital or other emergency.</p>

<p>If formula is your personal choice, we would like to remind you once again that breastmilk ensures optimal child growth and development and is the foundation of good health for life! Breastmilk is always available, hygienically safe, at appropriate temperature, at no cost. In the first six months of life, it is the only food and fluid that a child needs.</p>

<h2>Why does an infant need formula and not cow's milk?</h2>

<p>Most infant formulas are made from cow's milk, which has been modified to suit the baby's needs; the quantity and quality of basic ingredients, such as proteins, fats and carbohydrates, are adjusted as much as possible to the composition of breastmilk; vitamins, minerals, some fats and numerous other ingredients are added, so that the milk formula meets infant needs .</p>

<p>Some formulas also contain other additives, such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, prebiotics and probiotics, with the aim of reflecting the composition of human milk as closely as possible. It is not certain that these ingredients will have the same effect as those from breastmilk.</p>

<p>If your infant does not get your milk, feed him/her formula made from cow's milk during the first year of life. Until the age of 12 months, do not give the child cow's milk as a main food (a small amount can be added when preparing non-milk meals). The same recommendation applies to sheep's or goat's milk.</p>

<p>Powdered milk, skim milk or sweetened condensed milk are not recommended infant foods! Do not feed your baby milk substitutes, such as soy, rice, almond or coconut milk.</p>

<p><em>If you are considering feeding your infant some other milk, instead of breastmilk or infant formula, consult a pediatrician!</em></p>

<h2>Types of formulas</h2>

<p>Infant formulas must meet strict international and national quality standards. They are of similar quality and nutritional value and are suitable for most children. Some brands may be more expensive than others, but that doesn't necessarily mean your baby needs them. If a newborn is fed a specific formula in the maternity hospital, it does not automatically mean that this formula is the best.</p>

<p>First formulas (1) are recommended for feeding a child up to 6 months of age. In the second half of the first year, manufacturers recommend formula 2, which supports further child growth. Although there are differences in composition between formulas 1 and 2, just as breastmilk changes as the baby grows, switching to ""two"" is not necessary as soon as the baby is 6 months old, especially until you use up your supply of first formula.</p>

<p>Formula manufacturers also offer parents formulas for children over 12 months of age (known as follow-up formulas or formulas 3).  <em>A child older than one year does not need formula.</em></p>

<h2>Specialized formulas</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Instead of cow's milk proteins, hypoallergenic formulas have hydrolyzed proteins - broken down into smaller parts; the intention is to reduce the risk of developing allergy to cow's milk with this modification. Experts' opinions on these formulas are divided. While some believe that there is no evidence that being fed HA formula has a preventive effect on the occurrence of allergies in children, others recommend that, where formula is necessary, the first one to be given the child should be hypoallergenic.</li>
	<li>Children with a proven allergy to cow's milk proteins are fed a completely hydrolyzed formula, on the recommendation and under the supervision of a specialist in pediatric gastroenterology.</li>
	<li>There are other specialized formulas for feeding preterm babies and those with specific diseases and disorders; the diet of these children must always be on the recommendation and under the supervision of a physician.</li>
	<li>There are numerous other modifications of milk formulas, for children with various transient, functional problems such as vomiting, colic or constipation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The type of formula that your baby should drink is determined by a pediatrician. It is not recommended to change the type of formula yourself. Changing the formula can also cause some problems for the baby (colic, constipation, flatulence, vomiting) or a disruption in the baby's feeding routine due to the changed taste of the milk. If the doctor changes the type of formula, read the instructions carefully, because the size of the scoops and the way of preparing different formulas may differ.</p>",7041,1,"43,44,45,46,47,48",59,60,"566, 331","5811, 5701, 5686, 3341",1,0,"<p>Belamarich, P.F., Bochner, R.E., &amp; Racine, A.D.

5786,Night-time breastfeeding,"<p>From 6th month of life, thriving babies no longer need a night-time meal. Now it's just a habit, which can be all the more difficult to change as the child gets older.</p>","<p>In the first days, and even weeks, the baby does not have an established rhythm of breastfeeding and sleep; episodes of wakefulness and sleep alternate constantly, with the total daily length of sleep decreasing from month to month. Frequent breastfeeds initially ensure steady milk production in the breast and its emptying.</p>

<p>In the first weeks, the secretion of prolactin, the chief milk production hormone, is the highest at night. The newborn's stomach is small and cannot take in a large amount of milk. Owing to its  composition, breastmilk is digested quickly, so the child becomes hungry again soon. By night-time feeding, the newborn gets a third of the total daily calorie intake.</p>

<h2><strong>Do you need to wake your baby for a night-time meal?</strong></h2>

<p>Sometimes your newborn may be so sleepy that he/she doesn't wake up often enough for meals and doesn't get enough food. This can become a vicious circle - the less the baby is fed, the more sleepy he/she gets. <em>In the first six weeks of life, babies need 8-12 breastfeeds a day.</em><br />
If the baby sleeps a lot during the day, do not create ideal sleeping conditions (silence, darkened room). As soon as you notice the first signs of hunger, it means it's time for a meal. During this period, it is important to follow the signs of good thriving and check the child's weight more often.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your baby is healthy, over six weeks old and has gained enough weight, there is no need to wake him/her up for night-time breastfeeding, unless you feel great tension in your breasts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>How to prolong your child's night's sleep?</strong></h2>

<p>Here are some tips on how to prolong your child's night's sleep and reduce the number of night-time meals:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Breastfeed often; try to increase the frequency of breastfeeding during the day and early in the evening; this allows the child to get enough calories during the day, without the need for night-time meals, which is one of the reasons for waking up at night.</li>
	<li>Gradually increase the child's waking time; bathe the baby and play with him/her in the evening, thus slowly adjusting his/her sleeping rhythm.</li>
	<li>If you go to bed a few hours after the baby, try breastfeeding at the time you go to bed. Most babies will suckle a little and then fall asleep again.</li>
	<li>If the baby wakes up at night for a breastfeed, feed him/her in a quiet, darkened room. Do not change the diaper unless it is very wet, if the baby has pooped or has a diaper rash.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>After breastfeeding, put the baby back to his/her bed; it is not safe for a child to sleep with you in your bed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Phasing out night-time feeding</strong></h2>

<p>Try not to use food to put the child to sleep; if you do so, later he/she won't want to fall asleep on his/her own. The presence of milk and other sugars in the oral cavity during the night leads to the decay of erupting teeth, with far-reaching consequences. Every bedtime ritual at night creates a habit, so the child will not go to sleep without it. If you are sure that the baby gets enough food during the day, try to stop giving a night-time meal to an infant older than six months.</p>

<h2><strong>Here are some tips on what to do to make this transition less abrupt:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>If your baby only briefly suckles at night (less than 5 minutes), try simply the night-time feeds and soothing your baby in some other way that you apply daily (rocking, singing, etc.). It may take a few nights for the baby to get used to this new routine. Be patient.</li>
	<li>If the night-time meal still lasts a bit longer and its duration is equal to that of daytime meals, longer than 5 minutes, you can gradually reduce the meal duration over 5-7 nights.</li>
	<li>There are many reasons why a baby wakes up at night. As you are already fairly tired from waking up at night, you often immediately offer the breast out of habit, and the baby develops the habit of comfort suckling. First try to calm him/her down in some other way. In most cases, when the need for comfort is the reason for waking up, you will calm the baby; sometimes he/she will be inconsolable until the breast is offered.</li>
	<li>One tactic is to have the father pick up the baby and calm him/her when he/she wakes up at night during this phase-out period.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Should you phase out night-time breastfeeding or not?</strong></h2>

<p>Every baby is different. Some will stop night feeding at four months, and some at two years old. Your baby will stop waking up at night when he/she no longer needs night-time feeds and when he/she is developmentally ready for it. You need to listen to your baby's demands and feel when the time is ideal to stop night-time feeding.</p>

<p>Phasing out also depends on the parents; if you are tired of waking up once or multiple  times every night, try phasing out after the sixth month, if the child is healthy and thriving. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you will view night-time breastfeeding as your baby's normal developmental phase or as a problem depends on your expectations. Wait until you get to know your child and his/her needs and desires.</p>

The message ""mother's milk is the best"" is brought to the fore in sick newborn and infant nutrition.</p>","<p>Newborns in special and intensive care units can suckle if they have the coordinated suck-swallow-breathe reflex (usually around 34th gestational week), are not on mechanical ventilation and are clinically stable.</p>

<p>Preterm babies under 34 gestational weeks, children on mechanical ventilation or those whose disease deteriorates cannot suckle. Children with cleft palate, other abnormalities, such as heart defects, neurological or genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, may have difficulty suckling. In these situations, the baby can be fed breastmilk in a way that best suits his/her condition, until he/she is able to suckle.</p>

<p>If you are separated from your newborn for more than six to eight hours (preterm baby, sick newborn placed in an intensive care unit or transferred to another institution), you need to start emptying your breasts. In this way, you will stimulate milk production and enable your baby to get your milk, the best possible food.</p>

<h2><strong>Tips for hand expression of breastmilk</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>You must empty your breasts regularly, 6-8 times in 24 hours, in order to imitate the breast stimulation provided by a healthy, full-term newborn who is with his/her mother.</li>
	<li>Hand expression should take 20 minutes; the period between two sessions should not be longer than 5 hours, and you should by all means do it at least once during the night.</li>
	<li>In the first few sessions, the amount of milk may be minimal; it increases with practice.</li>
	<li>You can trigger the milk ejection reflex (oxytocin reflex) when you are in a comfortable and relaxed position, thinking of your baby, holding his/her photo or toy, watching him/her if you are together, gently warming and massaging the breast, gently stimulating the nipple between your thumb and forefinger .</li>
	<li>It is important to take care of hand hygiene and hygiene of the utensils for collecting and storing milk.</li>
	<li>Like breastfeeding, hand expression is a skill that is learned. You will get the necessary advice and assistance from the staff in the maternity hospital or intensive care unit; don't be afraid to ask for help.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hand expression is recommended in the beginning. In addition to collecting milk, hand expression can help relieve the uncomfortable feeling of engorgement in the breasts, reduce the swelling of the areola of an engorged breast so that the baby can latch on, release clogged milk ducts. In these cases, hand expression takes much shorter.</p>

<p>Pumps, manual or electrical, can significantly facilitate milk collection, especially if the child will not be able to suckle for a long time, or the mother and child are separated for other reasons (mother's illness or early return to work). New generation electrical pumps are adapted to mothers' different needs; a disadvantage is their high price. The pumping equipment must be maintained and sterilized according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maintaining lactation can be difficult and strenuous for the mother, especially if she is separated from the child for a long time. If you fail, you should know that there are specialized formulas, tailored to the needs of your child. In addition to nutrition, the warm and supportive relationship and love you give to your child play a key role in his/her optimal growth and development.</p>

5796,Breastfeeding position,"<p>Breastfeeding is a natural way of feeding children, but the process itself is a skill that is learned. For successful breastfeeding, it is important that you and your baby take a comfortable position during a breastfeed, that you feel comfortable and relaxed.</p>","<p>There are various positions you can take while breastfeeding. Owing to back pain, painful episiotomy wound or caesarean section wound, you may not be able to take the recommended breastfeeding positions. The best position is the one in which you feel comfortable; over time, you will find the position that best suits you and your baby </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For any position you choose, the basic principles that allow your baby to suckle successfully are important: The baby is positioned so that his/her whole body is next to yours, and his/her head is at the level of your breast. The baby's head, neck and body are in the same plane, with the face towards the breast. If it is a newborn, the whole body should be supported, rather than just the head and neck.</p>

<p>Sitting position with the baby in your arms - ""<strong>cradle hold</strong>"" - Your and your baby's spine are at right angles; the baby's head is in the crook of your arm; the baby's body is supported by the entire length of your arm; offer the breast with your free hand by placing your thumb on the upper side of the breast and your index finger and middle finger under the breast, holding the breast with your palm. </p>

	<li>Sitting position, with the baby in your arms - ""<strong>cross cradle</strong> <strong>hold</strong>"" - The baby lies on your lap or a pillow, to rise to the nipple. Make sure that the pillow supports the baby well, so that your arms do not support the baby's entire weight. If you are breastfeeding the baby on your left breast, support the breast with the ""U"" hold using your left hand, and hold the baby with the fingers of your right hand.</li>

	<li>Sitting position, with the baby in your arms - ""<strong>football hold</strong>"" - The baby's head is in the front, and his/her body is next to yours, under your arm. This is a good position for moms who gave birth by caesarean section and who breastfeed twins. It also helps if your milk release reflex is too strong. Hold the baby's head with your palm. Again, pillows can help keep the baby closer to the nipple.</li>

<p><strong>The breastfeeding position must be comfortable for the mother!</strong> In the desire to breastfeed her baby successfully, sometimes, especially in the first days, the mother takes various unnatural and forced positions, which are inevitably followed by back pain, stiff neck and other discomfort. The baby sometimes suckles as many as 10-12 times in 24 hours, so it is important that you are comfortable: to have back support, if you sit on a chair or armchair - to have leg support. The correct position can be supported by additional pillows - a ""nest"" pillow or ordinary pillows - put one behind your back for you to lean on, and another on your lap to put the baby on.</p>

<p><strong>Breastfeeding should not hurt! </strong>The first moments of breastfeeding may be accompanied by brief discomfort or pain. If you feel pain all the time during breastfeeding, it means that the baby has not latched on the breast properly and is suckling inefficiently. Stop breastfeeding by slipping your little finger into the baby's mouth next to the nipple, gently push the nipple out of his/her mouth and try again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every mother-baby pair is a world unto itself. Even mothers who already have experience with an older child quickly realize that, with each child, the experience is new and different, that it takes time to get to know each other and get used to it. Mother and baby must learn to function as an effective team. The most important thing is not to give up if everything doesn't work out immediately the way you expected!</p>

5806,Proper positioning of the baby on the breast,"<p>For successful breastfeeding, it is important that you and your baby master the breastfeeding technique as soon as possible. This ensures a good milk supply, allows the baby to suckle as much as he/she needs, prevents painful breastfeeding and nipple damage. Breastfeeding is natural, but it is also a skill that is acquired over time and through practice.</p>","<h2><strong>The key to successful breastfeeding is good grip and latching on the breast! </strong></h2>

<p>A common misconception is that a baby gets milk by simply sucking on the nipple, like a straw. It is necessary for the whole nipple and as much of the areola as possible to be in the baby's mouth - this is known as deep grip, with the nipple pointing up, towards the baby's palate. The nipple will thus reach the comfortable zone deep in the baby's mouth, at the border between the soft and hard palate; with the nipple deep in the mouth, the baby will be able to suckle more successfully, stimulating the flow of milk. If the baby has only a shallow grips of the nipple, it will be pressed against his/her hard palate; this way, the baby gets very little milk, breastfeeding is painful and the risk of nipple damage is high.</p>

<p>Latching on the breast will become easier and a routine over time and with practice, and you will no longer have to think about it. After 4-6 weeks, when the baby establishes control of the head and neck, he/she will be able to achieve a good latch on his/her own.</p>

<h2><strong>Positioning the baby on the breast/latching on the breast</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The baby is positioned so that his/her whole body is next to your body, and his/her head is at the level of your breast. The baby's head, neck and body are in the same plane, with the face towards the breast.</li>
	<li>Bring the child closer to you; the baby's body is straight, the ear, shoulder and hip should be in a straight line, because in that position the child swallows more easily.</li>
	<li><em>Remember the rule: the child approaches the mother, not the other way round!</em></li>
	<li>The breast is close to the baby's mouth and the baby should be allowed to explore the breast.</li>
	<li>Initiate the rooting reflex by gently stroking the baby's mouth with the nipple; you can squeeze out a drop of milk and spread it on the nipple.</li>
	<li>When the baby's mouth is fully open (as if yawning), point the nipple toward the palate; the nipple slides into the baby's open mouth down the upper lip, and the tongue is extended below the nipple.</li>
	<li>The baby's chin touches the breast, the lower lip is curved towards the chin, the tongue is below the nipple, and the nose is slightly away from the nipple.</li>
	<li>When the baby latches on the breast, you can deepen the grip by gently pulling the baby's body towards you.</li>
	<li>The mistake that mothers sometimes make is to try to push the nipple into the baby's mouth, when the mouth is not wide open.</li>
	<li>Hold the breast with your free hand at all times to make it easier for your baby to suckle. Make sure your fingers are not too close to the nipple, so that the baby has space to latch on the breast.</li>
	<li>Sometimes it is necessary to additionally prepare the breasts for breastfeeding (for example, in case of breast engorgement).</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Preparation of engorged breasts</strong>:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Put warm compresses on the breasts for 10-15 minutes before you start breastfeeding to stimulate milk flow.</li>
	<li>Then gently and lightly massage the breasts towards the nipple (as if ""playing music"" on the breast).</li>
	<li>Then manually squeeze out a few drops of milk to soften the area around the nipple and spread the milk on the nipple.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Proper grip and good breastfeeding technique:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The baby's mouth is fully open.</li>
	<li>The upper lip is positioned over the nipple and areola.</li>
	<li>The lower lip is curved outwards.</li>
	<li>The baby's chin touches the breast.</li>
	<li>The nipple is deep in the mouth, it does not touch the hard palate, but rather the baby's soft palate, there is vacuum.</li>
	<li>The baby sucks rhythmically, with pauses for swallowing, which you can see or hear; the cheeks are round, not dimpled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Poor grip:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The nipple looks flattened or wrinkled when removed from the baby's mouth at the end of a breastfeed. </li>
	<li>The baby holds the nipple in his/her mouth, does not suckle, or sleeps on the breast.</li>
	<li>There is a sound of sucking or smacking.</li>
	<li>You feel pain in your nipples during and after a breastfeed.</li>

<p>If the baby is not well positioned, if you feel pain, stop breastfeeding, tickle the baby's lower lip to make him/her gently drop the breast; take the baby off the breast and start over. Look at this process of getting used to it as learning to drive: in the beginning you have to think about every detail, constantly check yourself and be focused; when you learn and gain a routine, everything goes smoothly and easily.</p>

5811,Benefits of breastmilk and breastfeeding,"<p>Breastfeeding is the oldest biological need derived from an innate instinct, thanks to which we have survived as a species. It is part of the reproduction process, a prerequisite for survival and health, common to all cultures and civilizations. There is no substitute for breastmilk and no other baby food can compare with it!</p>","<h2><strong>Preparing for breastfeeding</strong></h2>

<p>Long before the act of childbirth, your body began to prepare for breastfeeding. Your breasts changed shape, became firmer and bigger, the skin on your breasts became more sensitive to touch. Nipples and areolas became darker; besides, changes in the breasts are often the first sign of pregnancy. Colostrum begins to be produced between 16th and 22nd week of pregnancy. Immediately after delivery, the first meal for your baby is ready in your breasts, although most mothers are not even aware that they already have milk.</p>

<h2><strong>Good to know when making a decision about breastfeeding</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Your milk is always available, hygienically safe, at appropriate temperature, free of charge.</li>
	<li>In the first six months of life, it is the only food and fluid that a child needs.</li>
	<li>Your milk is specially tailored to your baby's needs and changes from day to day, from month to month, from breastfeed to breastfeed, to meet the baby's needs.</li>
	<li>Through the taste of mother's milk, the child gets acquainted with the taste of the food eaten by the family.</li>
	<li>The money you would have to set aside each month for formula is quite a burden on your household budget and you can use it in a much better and more useful way.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF recommend exclusive breastfeeding until the age of 6 months and continued breastfeeding until the age of two, with the introduction of appropriate and safe food from 6th month. In 2006, the WHO presented new growth standards for children from birth to the age of 5. In the development of these standards, a breastfed child is set as the biological norm, against which all other children will be compared. The Pediatric Association of Serbia has recommended these growth standards for monitoring the growth and nutritional status of children from birth to the age of 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>For a child, the benefits of breastfeeding </strong>begin at an early age and last a lifetime. Breastmilk prepares the body for long-term health protection and adaptation to the environment. While the baby suckles, the risk of developing various diseases is reduced:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Intestinal infections - in developed countries, breastfeeding reduces the cost of treatment for intestinal infections, and in underdeveloped ones, it saves the children's lives</li>
	<li>Severe respiratory infections - proven reduced hospitalization rate due to lower respiratory tract infections</li>
	<li>Otitis media</li>
	<li>SIDS / Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Later in childhood,</strong> the risk of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allergy/asthma, atopic dermatitis</li>
	<li>Childhood leukemia</li>
	<li>Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease in children</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding helps the proper eruption of teeth, the development of the jaw and the vocal apparatus</li>
	<li>Chronic non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death, as well as illness, incapacity for work and enormous expenditures in developed countries worldwide.</li>
	<li>Breastfed babies will have lower cholesterol and lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes later in life.</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding and breastmilk have been shown to be effective in relieving procedural pain<strong> </strong>- pain caused by diagnostic and other procedures, such as capillary blood sampling, giving vaccines, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Positive</strong> <strong>influence on cognitive functions</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Breastfeeding improves higher  brain functions, such as thinking and memory;</li>
	<li>Breastfed babies perform better on intelligence tests.</li>
	<li>These effects are especially important for at-risk children, such as preterm and low-birth-weight babies.</li>
	<li>Improving cognitive functions is directly linked to the length of breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Benefits of breastfeeding for the mother</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Breastfeeding reduces the risk of premenopausal breast and ovarian cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes, in addition to gestational.</li>
	<li>Bone mineralization is better and the risk of hip fractures is reduced at a later age.</li>
	<li>Higher calorie and fat consumption contributes to an easier return to pre-pregnancy weight.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contraceptive effect:</strong> Breastfeeding delays the re-establishment of the menstrual cycle, ovulation and thus the possibility of conception. This effect is, however, limited and depends on a number of factors. Don't rely on being protected from unwanted pregnancy while breastfeeding; ovulation can occur without menstruation. Ask your gynecologist what contraceptive method is the best while breastfeeding. The interval between two pregnancies should be at least two years, especially if the birth was completed by caesarean section.</p>

<p>The longer you breastfeed, the better! For the child: it is best when it starts from the first day and when the child is exclusively breastfed; the positive effects are manifested after three months of exclusive breastfeeding and increase with longer breastfeeding. For the mother: the effects of each child's breastfeeding months add up!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BREASTFEEDING is far more than just eating. During breastfeeding, a strong bond is established between the mother and baby and the baby's need for love, warmth and security is met in a unique way. BREASTFEEDING IS FOOD FOR THE SOUL AS WELL!</p>

5816,Breast engorgement and clogged milk ducts,"<p>Some mothers have more milk than the baby can suckle, so they are more likely to have engorged breasts and at a higher risk of having clogged milk ducts. This is temporary, and milk ""supply"" and ""demand"" will soon balance out.</p>","<p>During milk production, additional amounts of blood and lymph arrive in the breast. The breast becomes warm, full, and heavy; this is normal, the breast can increase by up to 46% of its size before pregnancy. A rapid increase in the amount of milk and insufficient emptying of the breasts can lead to tension - engorgement. Breast engorgement can block the flow of milk, which leads to even more pronounced swelling. The breasts then become hot and painful, and the skin tight and shiny. The baby may suckle less than before, or on only one breast. Long breaks in breastfeeding also contribute to breast engorgement. Sometimes only one part of the breast can be hard and painful. When the milk from one part of the breast does not flow well, the cause may be the formation of milk clogs that block the milk duct. You may feel a lump under your fingers, and the skin around it may be red.</p>

<h2><strong>Causes</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Improper, insufficiently frequent and short breastfeeding.</li>
	<li>Insufficient milk emptying from a part of the breast.</li>
	<li>Local pressure on a part of the breast.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>In case of engorged breasts:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Make sure the baby is correctly positioned on the breast.</li>
	<li>Apply warm compresses (warm cloth diaper, stream of warm water, thermogel pads) for 5-10 minutes just before you start breastfeeding; this will make milk flow easier.</li>
	<li>Breastfeed your baby more often.</li>
	<li>Change the breastfeeding position: if you have breastfed the baby in the common cradle hold, next time switch to the ""rugby ball hold"".</li>
	<li>Gently express milk from the breasts before breastfeeding, as this softens the areolas.</li>
	<li>After breastfeeding, apply a cold compress to the breast for up to 15 minutes every hour until you are ready for the next breastfeed.</li>
	<li>If breastfeeding alone does not reduce tension, it is important to express milk between breastfeeds.</li>
	<li>Rest while the baby rests, ask the family for help with other duties.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>In case of clogged milk ducts:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Before breastfeeding, shower the part of the breast where the milk duct is clogged with warm water.</li>
	<li>Make sure the nipple itself is not clogged by rinsing it with water.</li>
	<li>Gently massage the clog downwards to the nipple (take breaks, gently express the milk).</li>
	<li>Always offer your baby the breast in which there is a clogged milk duct first.</li>
	<li>Breastfeed your baby more often.</li>
	<li>Check if your clothes, especially the bra, put pressure on a part of the breast.</li>
	<li>Avoid sleeping on your stomach because of the pressure on your breasts.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If you carry out all these measures, and the problem of engorged breasts or clogged milk ducts is not solved (or at least alleviated), if you develop an elevated temperature or fever, call a doctor. Mastitis may develop, which should be vigorously treated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Breast massage</strong> should be gentle, so that the fingertips gently shake the tissue, without roughly traumatizing the breast.</p>

<p><strong>Compresses</strong>: Warm compresses can help empty the breasts, 10-15 minutes before breastfeeding or pumping; they can be dry (thermogel pads) or wet (cloth diaper, towel). Do not put compresses over the nipple, especially not wet ones! Cold compresses are recommended during rest periods. The traditional method with cabbage leaves is often criticized and condemned by health professionals. Cabbage has been confirmed to relieve inflammation, and cold leaves have an effect similar to compresses. If you use it, use the inner leaves, wash them well and dry them, beat them a little with a meat mallet, cool them and apply them as a compress after breastfeeding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the first few weeks, the amount of milk is usually adjusted to the baby's needs. This information may be useful as you deal with the (un)expected obstacles that have arisen.</p>

5821,Formula preparation and hygiene of utensils,"<p>If you feed your baby formula, follow the instructions for preparing and storing the formula, as well as maintaining hygiene of the utensils. The baby's immune system is not strong enough to fight infections, and milk is an ideal medium for bacteria to multiply.</p>","<h2><strong>Preparing water for formula</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>When preparing formula for your baby, the first step is to always wash your hands with soap and water. It is also important that the work surface you use is clean.</li>
	<li>Boil fresh water on the stove or in the kettle. Allow it to cool for about 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
	<li>You can pour cooled boiled water into sterile bottles and keep it in the refrigerator until you need it. The bottles must be tightly closed, with a ring and a suitable lid.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Preparing formula</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Read the preparation instructions on the formula packaging; check that it has not expired.</li>
	<li>Pour the required amount of boiled, warm but not hot water into the bottle.</li>
	<li>Using the measuring cup from the formula pack, add the required number of scoops according to the amount of water. It is important to precisely measure the amount of powder (fill the measuring cup to the top, level the upper surface with a plastic spatula); the milk prepared in this way will contain all the ingredients in the foreseen quantity stated on the label. Do not dilute or thicken the formula on your own.</li>
	<li>Close the bottle tightly with a ring and cap.</li>
	<li>Shake the bottle or tap its bottom gently on the table to make the powder fall to the bottom; then shake the bottle vigorously to dissolve the powder.</li>
	<li>Remove the cap and replace it with a nipple.</li>
	<li>Before you start feeding your baby, check the temperature by dripping a few drops on the inside of your wrist. The milk should be lukewarm, never hot.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If your baby does not finish the bottle, discard the remaining milk immediately after the meal, or at the latest after an hour. Do not keep the remaining milk for later or for the next meal, because bacteria start to grow quickly in the used bottle. Do not add formula to the used bottle. Prepare each meal separately.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Can formula be prepared in advance?</strong></h2>

<p>It is best to prepare formula immediately before feeding the baby. If you need to prepare the formula in advance, cool it and put it in the refrigerator in a tightly sealed bottle no later than one hour after preparation; use it within 24 hours. Keep the bottle in the back of the refrigerator, where the temperature is lower and constant, not in the door. If you are traveling or planning a longer stay out of home, the safest way is to take boiled water and powdered formula in separate containers. If you plan to bring already prepared formula, prepare it in advance, cool it in the refrigerator and carry it in a cooler bag with ice packs. You can return the formula prepared and stored in this way to the refrigerator if no more than two hours have passed; be sure to use it within 24 hours.</p>

<h2><strong>Heating and cooling the milk formula</strong></h2>

<p>The safest way to heat formula is to immerse the bottle in a bowl of hot water. Special bottle heaters can be used if their thermostat is in order. Do not keep the bottle in the heater for more than 10 minutes, to avoid bacteria growth in your milk or formula. After heating, gently shake the bottle to equalize milk temperature and check on your wrist. If you accidentally overheat the milk, cool it under a stream of cold water.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not return heated milk to the refrigerator for later use. Do not heat milk in the microwave; it will heat up unevenly and may burn the baby's mouth!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Hygiene of utensils</strong></h2>

5826,Temporary interruption in breastfeeding,"<p>There are very few reasons associated with maternal health that require interruption of lactation and switching to artificial feeding. It is important to ascertain whether the disease itself represents a contraindication to breastfeeding, or just makes it difficult.</p>","<p>Conditions that represent a permanent contraindication to breastfeeding are rare; significantly more common are situations when contraindications are temporary and the mother can successfully breastfeed once she gets well, if it is an acute disease, or after completing the necessary treatment which is a contraindication to breastfeeding. Much more common are ""relative contraindications"", which could more accurately be described as barriers and challenges to breastfeeding. Parents often receive contradictory and confusing, or even misleading information and advice to stop breastfeeding when interruption is actually not necessary, or breastfeeding must only be interrupted for a short time.</p>

<h2><strong>Mother's acute diseases and fever</strong></h2>

<p>In almost all situations when you get sick while breastfeeding, you can safely continue to breastfeed. Continuing breastfeeding during illness carries a number of benefits both for you and for your child. During an infection, your body makes antibodies that pass into milk and help protect the child. Abrupt interruption of breastfeeding can cause breast engorgement and fever, and the child may become agitated. While the mother is ill, breastfeeding is a simpler way of feeding; there is no formula preparation, bottle and nipple sterilization, no need to get up to feed the child.</p>

<p>Interrupting breastfeeding if the nursing woman's body temperature is 38 °C or higher is not rare. This harms the breastfeeding process, while it has not been established that the incidence of infections in children increases. It is especially harmful to stop breastfeeding if the cause of fever is a clogged milk duct; in this situation, breastfeeding is actually the treatment - you can never empty your breast as thoroughly as your baby can. Fever in a nursing mother can sometimes be caused by a clogged milk duct, so interrupting breastfeeding only aggravates the problem, because no one can empty the breast as well as the child.</p>

<h2><strong>Newborn jaundice</strong> </h2>

<p>If your baby has newborn jaundice, you do not need to interrupt breastfeeding. It is only in rare cases of severe hyperbilirubinemia that there may be a need for temporary short-term interruption in breastfeeding.</p>

<h2><strong>Mother's hospitalization</strong></h2>

<p>If you need to have a surgical procedure while breastfeeding, or to go to hospital for a diagnostic procedure or treatment, this may interfere with breastfeeding. In consultation with the doctor, postpone all procedures that can be postponed without consequences, until you finish breastfeeding. If a delay is not possible, let the doctor know that you are breastfeeding, the child's age, whether he/she is exclusively breastfed or gets supplemental feeding as well, whether other foods have already been introduced. During hospitalization, you should regularly empty your breasts; seek help from the staff and, if possible, ask for pumping accessories. Another way is to have your household members bring clean pumping accessories and carry your breastmilk to the baby. Follow the recommendations for safe collection, storage and transport of breastmilk! If you need medications, your doctor will, whenever possible, choose those with which you can safely continue breastfeeding. The administration of medications that are not recommended during breastfeeding is a temporary breastfeeding contraindication. During this time, you will continue to empty your breasts regularly, but you will not give your breastmilk to the baby. He/she will be fed formula until your treatment is completed.</p>

<p>In all other situations when you are uncertain whether you can safely breastfeed your child, consult a doctor — gynecologist, pediatrician, relevant specialist in case of a specific disease or condition, and pharmacist. It is not rare for parents to get contradictory and confusing, or even misleading information and advice to interrupt breastfeeding when interruption is not actually indicated, or breastfeeding only needs to be interrupted for a short time. The use of medications while breastfeeding is one of the most common reasons for unwanted and unjustified interruption of lactation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If, due to illness or medications, you needed to stop breastfeeding for a short time, you will need patience and perseverance after recovery in order to restore lactation and re-introduce the baby to the breast. Any interruption of lactation poses a risk of permanent interruption of breastfeeding, with all the associated health risks of depriving the child of breastmilk.</p>

5831,Smoking tobacco while breastfeeding,"<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding are the periods of your life when you should by all means try to quit smoking. If you fail, your milk is still the best food for your baby and you should breastfeed.</p>","<p>If you smoke tobacco or electronic cigarettes while breastfeeding, harmful substances pass to the baby through milk, and he/she is also exposed to passive smoking. Tobacco smoke contains over 4000 chemicals (including cyanide, lead), of which 60 have been proven to be carcinogenic. Mothers who smoke (especially ""heavy"" smokers who smoke more than 20 cigarettes a day) may be deficient in beta carotene, vitamins B6, B12 and C. The child may be anxious, nervous, or have a sleep disorder. Nicotine can reduce milk production, and thus the child's thriving; mothers who smoke are more prone to mastitis.</p>

<p>Sudden infant death is more common in smokers' homes, and these children are more likely to have otitis media, asthma and a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases later in life.</p>

<p>If you are a smoker, it would be ideal to quit this bad habit while you are planning a pregnancy, or at least early in pregnancy. When you quit smoking, you have made one of the biggest changes that can improve your and your baby’s health. Seek professional advice and assistance to achieve this. It is easier to implement this decision during pregnancy, while you have more time, than after childbirth.</p>

<p>If you have not been able to shake off your bad habit, at least try to reduce the amount of cigarettes you smoke. A break between cigarettes and breastfeeding of at least 60 minutes is also recommended, because the amount of nicotine in milk decreases over time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can also protect your baby by always smoking outside. Tobacco smoke lingers in your hair, clothes and skin. While smoking, cover your hair and clothes with something that the baby will not come into contact with. Always wash your hands and brush your teeth after smoking, before picking up your baby. Make sure others who smoke do so far enough away from you and your baby.</p>

5836,Early initiation of breastfeeding - breastfeeding immediately after birth,"<p>In the first hour of life, most healthy newborns instinctively move towards their mother's breast and latch spontaneously. This early breastfeeding means a healthy start for your baby!</p>","<p>Skin-to-skin contact keeps the newborn optimally warm and encourages his/her feeding instincts. He/she receives the first feed of colostrum, rich milk with a protective role. Suckling helps the uterus shrink, accelerates placental expulsion and prevents bleeding. Early breastfeeding also helps to establish a strong bond between you and your baby.</p>

<p>Laid on the mother's chest and abdomen, dried and warm, after the phase of resting and getting used to the new environment, the newborn brings a hand to his/her mouth and makes sucking moves and sounds. He/she moves towards the nipple, finds it and takes it into his/her mouth wide open. The first breastfeed should be seen more as an introduction to the breast; the newborn should not be forced by pushing the breast into the mouth. You should not feel pressure as to the speed of initiating breastfeeding and its duration.</p>

<h2><strong>Advantages mother and child rooming in together:</strong></h2>

<p>The natural instinct of a mother and newborn is to be together after birth; there is no reason to separate a healthy newborn from his/her mother. Rooming in allows the mother to develop her maternal instincts at a time when her body's hormones are programming her for that role. Delaying and limiting rooming in can have detrimental consequences to establishing an emotional connection and breastfeeding success.</p>

<ul>
	<li>When your newborn is with you, he/she sleeps better and cries less;</li>
	<li>Breastfeeding is more successful and lasts longer; the child gains weight faster;</li>
	<li>Responsive breastfeeding is easier when the child is close, and this also stimulates the production of more milk;</li>
	<li>You will gain the necessary self-confidence by caring for your child;</li>
	<li>You will see that the baby is well and you will not worry if he/she cries while staying in another part of the maternity hospital;</li>
	<li>The child is at lower risk of infection;</li>
	<li>You may be afraid that you will not be able to rest; it has, in fact, turned out that the mother sleeps better when the baby is in a crib next to her.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Risks of unnecessary supplementation</strong></h2>

<p>A small amount of colostrum is enough to meet the needs of a healthy full-term newborn in the first days of life. Babies initially need a very small amount of milk. The amount of colostrum that the baby suckles during one breastfeeding session on the first day is 2 to 10 ml, in the second day - 5 to 15, and in the third day - up to 30 ml. The mammary glands produce a sufficient amount of milk for the first days; as the needs in terms of milk quantity grow, the baby provides him/herself with the needed amount of milk by suckling by frequently.</p>

<p>Your colostrum provides your newborn with the necessary amount of nutrients and fluids, as well as protection against infections. Unnecessary supplementation can cause the child to no longer want to suck because of the full stomach feeling. The milk supply will decrease, or your breasts will become full and hard. If supplementation is used to calm the baby, it can undermine your confidence that you will be able to breastfeed your baby successfully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The World Health Organization and UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is based on the 10 steps to successful breastfeeding, which have been recognized and verified as key factors of breastfeeding success. The most important steps in the maternity hospital are skin-to-skin contact, mother and newborn rooming in, responsive breastfeeding and avoiding unnecessary supplementation. The more steps are consistently applied in the maternity hospital, the higher the success of breastfeeding!</p>

5841,Flat or inverted nipples,"<p>About 10% of first-time breastfeeding women have flat or inverted nipples, which is a consequence of insufficient elasticity of the muscle tissue that raises the nipple. It is impossible to assess how the nipple will function during breastfeeding based on its appearance alone.</p>","<p>The problem is the most pronounced in the phase of milk coming in, when the breast is swollen and the area around the nipple is swollen and tight. Fortunately, the problem is usually temporary; tissue elasticity improves, the baby gets stronger and the suckling technique improves.</p>

<h2><strong>Just before breastfeeding, pull out the nipples:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>using a towel, rub the nipples a little ""vigorously"";</li>
	<li>rub an ice cube on the area between the nipple and the areola in circular motions;</li>
	<li>use a breast pump or niplette;</li>
	<li>wear a bra with an opening for the nipple and areola.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A silicone nipple</strong> can help; it is important that the size matches the size of the nipple. </p>

<p><strong>Niplettes</strong> <em>(</em>nipple pullers using suction) can help some women. Care should be taken to avoid swelling or damage to the nipple. Children who are expected to have difficulties suckling (preterm, small or sick babies) are especially likely to have problems with flat nipples. In these cases, additional monitoring of the child's breastfeeding and progress is required, as well as an individual feeding plan.</p>

<p>Sometimes the nipples are extremely inverted and the breast anatomy makes it very difficult for the baby to suckle. If a child cannot be breastfed, it does not mean that he/she cannot be fed with breastmilk! Pumping and feeding breastmilk to the child will ensure all the benefits of natural nutrition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flat or inverted nipples are a common cause of early quitting and breastfeeding failure. If you have a problem, it is important to be persistent and seek professional assistance. In the beginning, the baby's weight needs to be checked more often to makes sure that breastfeeding is successful.</p>

5846,What does breastmilk contain?,"<p>There is nothing like the composition of breastmilk! Human milk is a complex living substance capable of change, which follows, supports and directs the child's development. There is no substitute for breastmilk. It contains thousands of different ingredients, and most of them ingredients cannot be artificially produced.</p>","<p>Nowadays, human milk is defined as a biological system, rather than just food, and is considered a medical resource. Nature has long provided children with personalized medicine from the first day of life! When it was already thought that all the secrets of human milk had been discovered, 21st century brought incredible insights into the composition and roles of human milk and opened the door to numerous new researches.</p>

<h2><strong>There is no bad breastmilk!</strong></h2>

<p>It changes according to the child's needs during breastfeeding and during the period of child growth and development. According to its characteristics, and depending on the time of production, we distinguish between colostrum, transitional and mature milk.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Colostrum</strong> is the milk that mom produces in the first few days after giving birth. It is a thick, sticky, clear to yellowish liquid. It contains more water, proteins, enzymes and vitamin A, and less lactose, fat and water-soluble vitamins. Its main role is protective (it contains immunological components: IgA, lactoferrin and leukocytes), so it represents the first vaccine. It helps in passing the first stool - meconium. </li>
	<li><strong>Transitional milk</strong> is produced from 6th to 15th day. Its role is less protective and more nutritional </li>
	<li><strong>Mature milk</strong> is produced after 15th day. It contains less protein, and more fats and carbohydrates, as well as vitamins and minerals. It is thinner and white in appearance; it may seem to too thin, watery, transparent, not of good enough quality for your baby. Don't be afraid, your milk follows your baby’s needs!</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Breastmilk composition is not constant!</strong></h2>

<p>During a meal, the first milk is thinner and lower in fat, and it serves to quench the baby's thirst - <em>foremilk</em>; it is followed by thicker milk, higher in fat, so that the baby can satisfy his/her hunger unhurriedly - hindmilk.  It is important that breastfeeding lasts long enough for the baby to get enough high-fat milk, necessary for energy and growth. During the day, fat content is the highest early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Breastmilk composition follows the needs of the child - it changes depending on the child's age of, season, child's sex - milk for girls and boys is not the same either! The milk of preterm babies' mothers is adapted to the growth needs of immature babies in terms of its composition, especially the amount of protein and higher caloric density.</p>

<h2><strong>Nutritional composition of breastmilk</strong></h2>

<p>Your milk provides your baby with all the necessary nutrients for optimal growth and development in the first six months. Breastmilk is a complex nourishing fluid that contains fats, proteins, sugars, vitamins, minerals, antibodies, enzymes, water and many other ingredients in exactly the ratio and amount needed to ensure the baby's optimal growth and development.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The composition and quantity of proteins, fats and carbohydrates are completely in line with the child's needs. </li>
	<li>Water makes up 87% of your milk. A responsively breastfed baby thus satisfies his/her water needs and does not need to be given water, teas or other beverages.</li>
	<li>Your milk also contains enzymes that help digestion and utilization of all nutrients.</li>
	<li>Oligosaccharides - mom's sweet secret: oligosaccharides are milk superheroes; they bind bacteria and help eliminate them, regulate immune maturation and serve as food for probiotic bacteria. The vitamins and minerals from your milk are well absorbed and used.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Good to know: Some ingredients in your milk, such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, are not just the result of what you ate the day before but what you ate, what physical activity you had, and what types of toxins and stresses you were exposed to for many months before the baby was born.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breastmilk is the body's best natural defense. When a baby is born, your milk is the baby's first vaccine, which helps protect him/her from infections and diseases and develop the baby's immunity. Breastmilk also contains stem cells, whose significance and role are not fully elucidated; one thing is for sure: if nature intended them for a newborn, they have an important role to play!</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bifidogenic factors</strong> stimulate the growth of the newborn's intestinal flora. Lactose (milk sugar) and oligosaccharides (complex sugars that act as prebiotics) together have an impact on the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.</li>
	<li><strong>Biomodulatory factors</strong> are a number of bioactive agents that regulate the growth, development and function of the epithelium, immune and nervous systems of the gastrointestinal tract. The ingredients in your milk affect the nutrition, growth and maturation of the baby's nervous system.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Breastmilk microbiome</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Our health and our bodies' good functioning depend on different microbial communities living in unexpected parts of our bodies.<strong> </strong>Breastmilk has long been considered sterile. Today, it is known to contain a special combination of microorganisms called the human milk microbiome.<strong> </strong>One of the assumptions is that, in this way, breastmilk prepares the child for living in the natural environment in which he/she grows up.</li>
	<li>A newborn's intestinal microbiome consists of the bacteria that settle in his/her colon. Breastmilk, natural (vaginal) childbirth and skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth have a positive effect on the colonization of the intestine with these beneficial bacteria.</li>
	<li>Milk pasteurization inactivates immune and anti-infectious factors, but the nutritional and biological components do not change. Immunological properties cannot be reproduced in formulas<strong><em>.</em></strong></li>

<p>The most commonly used feeding method is bottle with a nipple. Bottle feeding can create difficulties in latching on the breast and sometimes even leads to breastfeeding failure. It is not recommended as a feeding method either for a child who cannot suckle yet, or one who has received supplemental feeding.</p>

<p>If your baby is bottle-fed, it is important to follow the recommendations for maintaining equipment hygiene and preparing meals. It is recommended that around 6th month, the child starts using a cup, learns how to drink from a cup and stops using the bottle by the end of the first year. Probe feeding is needed for children who do not have suckling-swallowing coordination. Syringes, droppers or teaspoons can be used for very small amounts of milk, such as colostrum in the first days of life.  The baby cannot control the flow of milk, so there is a possibility of choking on milk if it is given too quickly.</p>

	<li>Mashed beans or eggs can replace meat.</li>
	<li>Children need foods rich in iron, in order to improve their physical and mental abilities and prevent anemia. The best sources of iron are animal-origin foods - eggs, meat, liver and fish. Another way of ensuring a sufficient iron intake is iron-fortified food (cereals or formulas for children on supplemental or artificial feeding).</li>
	<li>Give the child freshly prepared cooked food at least once or twice a day, and other meals can be dry and light - fruit, bread, biscuits, bananas. Safe food preparation and storage/safe child feeding   </li>

5881,Healthy baby food,"<p>One of the main prerequisites for good health is a varied diet. A child is considered to eat well if he/she eats foods from all five groups every day (Milk and dairy products / Fruits / Vegetables / Cereals / Meat, fish, eggs). It is not uncommon for a child to persistently refuse some of the offered foods; it is important to know that each food can be replaced by some other from the same group.</p>","<h2><strong>How to choose and prepare food for your baby</strong></h2>

<p>It is important to offer your child a wide range of healthy and quality foods from the beginning; this is a sure way for him/her to adopt healthy eating habits for life. Try to give your child a variety of foods, especially vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Babies learn to love the food they get used to. What a child eats at the age of about 9 months largely indicates what he/she will eat at school age. If he/she gets used to different fruits and vegetables prepared in different healthy ways, he/she will also learn to control the desire for unhealthy foods with too much salt, sugar, saturated fatty acids and calories.</p>

<h2><strong>Five food groups</strong></h2>

<p>We constantly hear recommendations that diet should be varied and balanced. Grouping foods into five groups should make this difficult task easier for us.</p>

<p><strong>1. Protein group </strong>includes meat, fish, eggs, legumes, nuts, seeds and soy.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Give the baby blitzed meat (chicken, veal, turkey), and later finely diced; when preparing a meal, use the broth from cooking meat to dilute the purée; the broth itself is not a meal for a child, due to its low caloric density. Children do not like dry and hard meat, they like it stewed or minced. It will be easier to eat in mixed purées with vegetables or cereals.                                                </li>
	<li>Fish can be introduced already from 7th month, prepared by cooking. Marine fish is the best source of omega-three unsaturated acids.                                    </li>
	<li>Introduce egg yolks (hard-boiled) gradually - an eighth, then a quarter, a half, and finally whole, two or three times a week, alternately with meat, in purées with vegetables or cereals.</li>
	<li>Legumes (beans, peas, lentils) can be introduced in 9th month. Because of their bloating effect, soak them in the evening and serve as a purée, with a neutral cereal such as rice. Soy is not recommended in the diet until the third year of life.</li>
	<li>For the safety of the child, nuts are given only in the form of a paste (spread).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Fruit group </strong>includes fresh, canned, frozen or dried fruit. Apples are usually introduced first, followed by seasonal fruits (peach, apricot, plum, pear). Banana is a great food for an infant, but many do not recommend it at the very beginning of introducing solid foods, as - due to its sweet taste - the child may not want other foods. Fruits are cooked, as a compote, prepared with a little water and without added sugar, first individually, and later in various combinations, as a fruit purée or combined with cereals.</p>

<p><strong>3. Vegetable group </strong>contains all kinds of vegetables, raw, cooked, frozen, canned or dried. Mild-tasting vegetables (potatoes, carrots, zucchini, pumpkin) are introduced first, and then gradually other vegetables as well (broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, peppers, leeks). They are prepared by cooking or steaming, making sure to cook it well, to avoid bloating or other digestive problems.</p>

<p><strong>4. Milk and dairy group </strong>includes foods rich in calcium - milk, cheese, sour cream, yogurt, etc. <em>Cow's milk</em> is not recommended in the first year as a staple food; a small amount of pasteurized/boiled milk can be used to prepare a meal. <em>Fermented dairy products</em> (drinking yogurt, thick yogurt, sour cream) can be introduced from 7th month.</p>

<p><strong>5 Cereals </strong>(and products made from flour) are a separate group. They can be refined or whole-grain. If they are whole-grain, wheat, rice, barley, corn, oats, spelt, etc. are high in fiber, iron and vitamin B. You can start with mild-tasting purées (rice, corn), which you can also prepare with your own milk, preserved according to the recommendations for collecting and freezing milk.</p>

<p>Fats are important in infant nutrition. In addition to being a significant energy source, some fats are necessary for proper nervous system development. From 7th month, you can add a small amount of oil (one teaspoonful), preferably unrefined, cold-pressed olive or other vegetable oil, when preparing a savory meal.</p>

<p>Don't forget the water! A child who was exclusively breastfed until 6th month should now be offered water. Boiled, cooled water is given to the child between meals until the age of one.</p>

<h2><strong>Good sources of some of the key nutrients</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Calcium - milk, yogurt, cheese, spinach, beans, peas, sardines, sesame seeds.</li>
	<li>Proteins - meat, cheese, eggs, plant-based foods (beans, lentils, cereals).</li>
	<li>Iron - the best source are animal-origin foods (meat, egg yolks); other sources: green vegetables, peas, beans, lentils. Iron from plant-based foods has lower bioavailability, it is better resorbed in the presence of vitamin C. It is recommended to give the child iron-fortified foods (cereals, milk purées) until the age of 18 months.</li>
	<li>Fiber - fruits, vegetables, whole grain products.</li>
	<li>Antioxidants - brightly colored fruits and vegetables (spinach, carrots, tomatoes).</li>
	<li>Omega-3 fatty acids - marine fish.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will get various tips and recommendations for your baby's diet. You may be confused by too much information: detailed recommendations on daily calorie and nutrient intake, expert information on various nutrients and their role are not really needed and only increase the concern whether the child is eating well. Expert recommendations are sometimes contradictory: advice on the recommended intake of milk, water, protein, which foods to give the child first. New recommendations<strong>: </strong>There is also the ""trend"" of early introduction of foods that are not native to our area, borrowing from other backgrounds and cultures. Inappropriate advertisements for baby food and the introduction of supplements: It is difficult to navigate through commercial recommendations for supplements - vitamins, multivitamin preparations, probiotics, by manufacturers or health professionals.</p>

<h2><strong>Some of the dilemmas you may have about your child' s diet</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Why is seasonal food recommended? Over the generations, our bodies have adapted to the food eaten by our ancestors in our region.</li>
	<li>Why are locally produced foods recommended? When an infant is given fruit that is transported from distant countries, there is a risk of contamination; besides, it contains various chemical substances to keep it fresh or accelerate ripening.</li>
	<li>What are the benefits of home-made purées? Home-made food is the best choice for your baby; when you prepare food from fresh ingredients, you know exactly what you give to your child.</li>
	<li>When are ready-made purées recommended? Industrially produced baby purées in jars are practical for feeding the child out of home, but often contain excess water, starch and sugar.</li>
	<li>Individual foods or a combination? Each new food should be given to the child for three days, in order to see if the child likes it or if it leads to an allergic reaction. You can combine the new food with others that the child is already used to.</li>
	<li>What food combinations are recommended? After the introduction of several basic foods in the infant's diet, dairy and cereal, fruit and cereal, and meat and vegetable purée combinations can be made.</li>
	<li>How many foods in one meal? Avoid giving your child more than three foods in one meal, to let him/her get used to the individual ones.</li>
	<li>Are there any foods that are absolutely necessary for my child? NO! No single food is necessary, if it is not available to you or the child consistently refuses it, and it can be replaced with another from the same group.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The journey from breastfeeding to feeding at the family table takes time and patience, and your infant will not immediately eat food from all five groups. The first step is to give your baby solid food. When he/she starts accepting it, plan to give him/her foods from different groups in every meal, because this will provide all the nutrients necessary for proper growth and development.</p>

5891,Optimal nutrition for children from 3 to 5 years,"Proper nutrition is one of the most important prerequisites for optimal growth and development of your child. At the age of 3 to 5, the child's growth slows down, but what, when, and how she or he eats is still invaluable for your child's health. This is also the period that should be used to form healthy eating habits.","<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">During the second year of your toddler's life, you learned about the child's nutritional needs, the choice and method of food preparation, got to know your child's habits and overcame the greatest difficulties that arose. It turned out that from the third year, the parents' attention is more focused on other activities and needs of the child. Remember, nutrition is still one of the key factors that helps a child grow and develop to its full potential. Proper nutrition is also good prevention for nutritional and health problems later in life, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart and blood vessel diseases.  </p>

After the age of two (up to the fourth), a child should take 1300 calories in 24 hours for normal growth and weight gain. Caloric needs, however, vary depending on the activity, as well as the structure and metabolism, so don't worry if your child doesn't eat as much as you expect.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">In this age, the appetite varies, it is higher during some periods but often decreases when the child is tired or excited.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">The child should be offered a variety of foods from all five food groups.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">After the second year, milk with 2% milkfat / skimmed milk can be offered instead of whole milk, the amount should be limited to about 500 ml. Juice to 120 ml per day.  </p>

	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">If your child eats a lot of fresh fruits, vegetables, and cereals, a child of this age will not need additional vitamins. Food-derived vitamins are the easiest to give you child and comes naturally in the best combinations.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Eating habits that should be avoided are; using a bottle, larger amounts of sweets, thick juices, sweetened cereals, chips, candy.  </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">The daily menu should consist of more frequent smaller meals (usually three meals and two snacks in between).

	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Breakfast should be in the first hour after waking up.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Other meals are planned at intervals of two to three hours. The last meal of the day should be at least an hour before going to bed.  </p>

	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Try to enrich your toddler's menu with new ideas and ways to prepare food. Kids love colorful, attractively served food.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Snacks should be offered between meals because it is difficult for a small child to provide the calories and nutrients he needs through just three main meals. They are also convenient for the introduction of new food, often the child will accept it for a snack first.  </p>
	</li>

<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">The habits we adopt in the early years follow us throughout our lives.

Also, prepare yourself with patience and understanding.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">How much will she or he will eat. Put on less on the plate, and then add more if needed. Do not force the child to eat everything you put on the plate. Let the younger child eat with his fingers and teach the older ones how to use cutlery.

</ul>

<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">  </p>

<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">For the optimal growth and development of your toddler and the creation of good habits, it is important not only what and how much the child eats, but also when, how and where he eats, who feeds or supervises the child during the meal. At the age of two, your toddler has developed motor skills well enough to eat without help and should be allowed to do so. You should tolerate children's sometimes ‘lack of manners’ at the table and the mess that comes with it. Just continue to show them your good manners, the child will learn from you. A child at this age should define what she or he likes and does not like, which can be very demanding of you and often delays eating time.    </p>

<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">At the age of three, the child can use a spoon and fork. She or he will most likely look for their favorite food (often sweets) and she or he may require the same food for several days in a row. Children like to help in the kitchen and to play cooking. Teach your child from an early age to eat at the table, to chew every bite, and never to rush or talk while the bite is in their mouth. If your toddler early on grows into enjoying eating with the rest of the family, your child will learn that meals are both a time for socializing and pleasant family moments.  </p>

<p lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"" xml:lang=""EN-US"">Be an example to your child! Toddlers look at and adopt the habits of their parents and family, regardless of what we tell and advise them. Taking care of a healthy diet for children is also an opportunity for the family to reconsider their eating habits and make some positive changes. It is easier to follow small steps and incorporate them into our daily habits. You may be surprised how small changes can lead to great progress in your family’s health. </p>",2546,1,"51,52,57",59,60,"131, 2711",,0,1,"<p>Savage, J., Orlet Fisher, J., &amp; Birch, L.L. (2007).

5901,The feeding and sleeping rhythm during the first week of life,"<p>During the first week of life, your newborn spends the most time sleeping, waking up every few hours for feeding. Newborn babies can’t sleep through the night; their stomach is small and they need frequent meals.</p>","<p>In the first days, and even weeks, a baby does not have an established rhythm of wakefulness and sleep. A newborn sleeps an average of 18 hours a day, so - except during changing and feeding - waking periods are short.</p>

<p>Most babies need to be fed every 2-4 hours and usually have 8-12 meals in 24 hours. A newborn's stomach is small and can't take a large amount of milk. The composition of breastmilk allows it to be digested very quickly, within 90 minutes, so the child becomes hungry again soon. Every baby has a distinct personality from birth; even very young babies have their own feeding habits, as do adults. Some babies suckle 6-8 times a day, while others like to ""snack"" more often, so they have 12-14 meals.</p>

<p>Most babies wake up by themselves at meal time. Some babies are drowsy and more passive in the first weeks (especially premature babies, babies with low birth weight or those who had a health problem or greater weight loss in the first days). These babies should be woken up every three hours and changed to wake up; skin-to-skin contact should be used to encourage the baby to suckle more actively and check their weight more often.</p>

<p>It takes time for the baby to establish his/her own rhythm of feeding and sleeping. The baby adapts and reacts to the environment day by day, and parents learn to recognize their baby's needs. The baby signals what he/she wants, you try to figure out his/her needs, you do everything you have learned, heard, assumed and somewhere along that learning path, an understanding of the baby's needs slowly develops. This period of getting to know each other can be challenging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the first weeks after the child is born, you should also think about yourself. This means that you should have regular meals, some physical activity, and sleep while the baby sleeps, which will allow you to make up for the lack of sleep. Seek help from family and friends!</p>

<p>In order to provide yourself and your child with peace and rest, postpone the celebration of the child's birth, the gathering of family and friends. It takes at least a month to recover from the delivery, adjust to the baby's rhythm, make sure that breastfeeding works well. When mom, dad and baby start functioning as a coordinated and smooth-running team, there will be time for celebrations and socializing.</p>

<p>If you have questions, dilemmas or doubts about breastfeeding, call the ""Hello Baby"" telephone counseling service of the Belgrade City Institute of Public Health at 011/7158-444. The visiting nurses on phone duty (24/7) will provide you with professional assistance and advice, and help you calm down.</p>

6116,Tall stature,"<p>Parents rarely ask ""Is my child too tall?"" A tall child is seen as a child with a hereditary predisposition related to height combined with good nutrition and health. This is usually the case. Sometimes it can be annoying when the environment perceives the child as older and more mature due to his/her tall stature and, consequently, has higher expectations.</p>","<p>The child's height (length) is one of the growth parameters that is measured and monitored during regular preventive examinations by a pediatrician, and deviations from the expected values can be noticed easily and in a timely manner. In our environment, the World Health Organization growth charts are used; on these charts, the indicated lines (+/- 2SD relative to the mean value) represent the limit values of the normal growth range of children of the same sex and age. However, when it comes to height, a child whose height significantly exceeds the expected height for his age (achieves a value of + 3 SD on the growth chart) is considered very tall. If the child's height exceeds the limit values, he/she is in good health, there are no other signs of deviation in the clinical picture and the parents or close relatives are tall, then it is the child's expected height.</p>

<p>A child whose height (length) exceeds the upper limit for sex and age or records an unusual growth spurt, or who has some associated health problems, rarely needs a more detailed examination. Possible hereditary causes or increased growth hormone secretion are then considered.</p>

<p>Changes in the genetic or chromosomal basis (Marfan, Sotos, Beckwith-Wiedemann, Klinefelter syndrome...), in addition to prominent growth in height, result in other characteristics in the child's clinical picture that indicate a possible hereditary disorder.    </p>

<p>Bone and muscle growth, and thus growth in height, is strongly influenced by growth hormone. Elevated values of this hormone during the child's growth period, when the cartilage at the ends of the bones is still open, lead to the occurrence of <strong>gigantism:</strong> very tall stature with long limbs and a prominent chin. In case of elevated growth hormone in adults, after bone growth is completed, a clinical picture of <strong>acromegaly</strong> will develop<strong>,</strong> characterized by<strong> </strong>enlarged hands, feet and prominent facial features. Growth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain, just below the part of the brain called the hypothalamus, together with which it regulates the operation of other endocrine glands.</p>

<p>When gigantism is suspected, the child is referred to an endocrinologist for X-ray and laboratory tests in order to assess growth hormone secretion and the condition of the pituitary gland. Sometimes, a smaller tumor is detected in the pituitary gland area, the treatment of which has been more and more successful recently.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your child's height significantly exceeds the expected height for the child's calendar age (+ 3SD on the growth chart) or you have noticed an unexpected growth spurt in height, talk to your chosen pediatrician about your child's growth and behavior.</p>

6196,Myths and facts regarding vaccine,<p>The broad usage of vaccines around the word has been accompanied by lots of concerns regarding their safety and possible influences and long term side effects. In the following paragraph we will summarize the facts regarding these concerns.</p>,"<p>The broad usage of vaccines around the word has been accompanied by lots of concerns regarding their safety and possible influences and long term side effects. In the following paragraph we will summarize the facts regarding these concerns.</p>

<p>It is always ok and even justified to be concern and look for information regarding medical issues in general, and specifically regarding vaccines. However, we strongly suggest following information from reliable sources like central health organizations such as the WHO, the European Medical Agency, The American academy of pediatrics etc. The electronic media is flooded with information that a big part of it is without scientific base and sometime even intentionally false and ""fake"".</p>

<p>It is very important to separate between ""temporal association""; When two events happen by co-incidence one after the other to ""'cause and effect"" association. In many cases when two events happen one after the other, there no reason to believe that the first event caused the second one.</p>

<p>For example, if an earthquake happened 1 day after a loss of the national football team no one would believe that the loss caused the earthquake.  This is just a co-incidence.</p>

<p>This is the case with several bad things that may happen following vaccination: we should remember that many of the genetic and developmental illnesses appear during the first 2 years of life. This is also the time when most of the vaccines are given. It is very tempting to believe that the vaccine caused the illness. However we need to find out if this was a co-incidence or really a cause and effect issue. Therefore many huge epidemiological studies have been done with several methods of investigations and in different countries with different researchers. The overwhelming mass of evidences provides a very reassuring message that vaccines are very safe and do not cause serious diseases.</p>",9511,8,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"126, 756, 121, 131",,0,0,,en,published
6201,A child did not gain weight: from 6 to 24 months,"""A healthy child who eats well should progress in weight every month. If your child has not progressed enough since the previous measurement, it is necessary to react quickly to discover the cause of the problem. Sometimes you can find a solution yourself, and sometimes you need to turn to the doctor. ""","<p>A child who is not gaining weight during one or two months may need more food for a meal, more nutritious foods, or more frequent meals. The child may be ill and need more attention and care or help with meals.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here are some important questions to consider to help identify the causes of growth and progression problems:</strong></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Does the child eat often enough?</strong>  In addition to breastfeeding, a child aged 6-8 months needs 2-3 meals, and from the 9th month 3-4 meals of other foods. Additional nutritious snacks, such as a piece of fruit or bread with a healthy spread, may be needed 1-2 times a day. Children with delays or developmental disabilities sometimes need extra help and time to feed.</p>

<p><strong>Did the child get enough food? </strong>A child aged 6-8 months initially needs 2-3 teaspoons of food, and the amount is gradually increased to ½ a cup (of 250 ml), for each meal at the age of 9-12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Does the child's meals contain enough energy and nutrients?</strong> Foods that help a child's growth are beans, nuts, meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, cereals and legumes. The daily inclusion of food of animal origin is especially important. A small amount of oil can provide extra energy. Quality ""growth food"" is especially important to ensure adequate growth in weight and height. Foods such as processed fatty foods or sweet snacks are not rich in vitamins and minerals or other important nutrients and can lead to excessive weight gain without adequate growth in height.</p>

<p><strong>Does the child get too much sweet food (cakes, cookies) or sweetened liquids (juices, teas) or other unhealthy food for meals or snacks?</strong>Reduce or replace these foods with nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, meat ,according to dietary recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Did the child get too much milk formula or other liquids (juices, teas) and not enough solid food?</strong> The fluid fills the stomach and reduces the child's need for food.</p>

<p><strong>Did the child refuse to eat? </strong>If the child does not like the taste of a certain type of food, he should be offered another. New foods should be introduced gradually.</p>

<p><strong>Is the child sick?</strong> A sick child should be encouraged to eat small, more frequent meals. Breastfeeding should be more frequent. After the illness, the child should eat more than usual to compensate for the lost weight, energy and nutrients. If the child is often ill, you should seek medical help for him.</p>

<p><strong>Did the child get enough foods that contain vitamin A?</strong> Breast milk is rich in vitamin A. Other foods that contain it are liver, eggs, dairy products, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, and green leafy vegetables. If these foods are not available in sufficient quantities, the child should be given a supplement (tablets or syrup every 4-6 months).</p>

<p><strong>Did the child get the milk formula from the bottle?</strong> If the child is fed a milk formula, a clean cup or glass is recommended rather than a bottle with a pacifier.</p>

<p><strong>Is food prepared and stored in a clean and safe way?</strong> If not, the child will often be ill. Raw food should be well washed or cooked, using clean water from a safe source. Cooked food should be eaten immediately; the remaining food should be carefully stored and properly reheated before eating.<br />
<strong>Is the child often alone or left in the care of older children? </strong>A child needs more attention from adults, especially during meals.</p>",4326,5,"47,48,49,50",59,60,"6291, 2711",,0,0,"<p><em>Životne poruke</em>/ Produced by UNICEF, WHO, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNDP, UNAIDS, WFP and the World Bank</p>",en,published

<p><strong>THREE SUBSTANCES</strong> from tobacco products stand out in particular:</p>

<p><strong>Nicotine</strong> - acts on the brain after only a few seconds. It affects blood pressure increase and accelerates the heart rate. It is to ""blame"" for creating a <strong>strong addiction </strong>to tobacco!</p>

<p><strong>Carbon monoxide</strong> - takes the place of oxygen in the transport through the bloodstream and thus <strong>reduces the amount of oxygen,</strong> which we need for the normal functioning of our tissues and organs.</p>

<p><strong>Tar</strong> - narrows the small airways in the lungs and further hinders oxygen supply. In addition, it is deposited in the bronchioles and, over time, causes <strong>""smoker's cough"" </strong>and facilitates the development of many <strong>lung infections</strong>.</p>

6211,Smoking and COVID-19,"<p>It is generally known that smoking is a significant risk factor for the development of many respiratory system diseases, so the question logically arises - is there and what is the health impact of tobacco consumption during the current COVID-19 pandemic?</p>","<blockquote>
<p>SMOKING DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM CORONAVIRUS! ON THE CONTRARY!</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h2><strong>Increased risk of infection</strong></h2>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Smokers'<strong> fingers</strong> come into direct contact <strong>with the mouth</strong> significantly more often, making potential <strong>virus transmission from hand to mouth more likely</strong> than in non-smokers.</p>

<p>Special risk of infection - tobacco products involving a social component, such as <strong>hookah</strong>, but also <strong>electronic tobacco products</strong>, if used by more than one person.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h2><strong>More severe clinical picture of the disease</strong></h2>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Most smokers have a <strong>reduced lung capacity,</strong> which is a special problem when the need for oxygen is increased or when the ability to use it adequately in the body is reduced, which is the case with infections. There is a growing body of scientific evidence that <strong>smokers are a group at higher risk of developing a more severe clinical picture of</strong> <strong>COVID-19.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h2><strong>And what about passive smoking?</strong></h2>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Children now spend more time indoors than usual. <strong>In children who grow up in conditions of increased exposure to tobacco smoke, the body's defenses are generally weakened</strong>, putting them at higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections, otitis media, and asthma. These children also develop a <strong>more severe clinical picture of viral pneumonia</strong>, such as that caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>

<p>A special health risk - <strong>""residual"" tobacco smoke</strong> - smoke that remains in the form of small particles on the surrounding surfaces and objects, from where it continues to cause toxic effects for a long time.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h2><strong>Don't make a bad habit worse!</strong> <strong>Let the pandemic prompt positive shifts!</strong></h2>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>More time indoors, fewer activities, boredom, work from home, a state of increased stress and anxiety - there is a real danger of reaching for a cigarette more frequently, and former smokers may even be tempted to relapse.</p>

<p>On the other hand - the current situation may be a unique time to approach some life decisions with fresh motivation.</p>

<blockquote>

6221,E-cigarettes - new tobacco products,"<p>E-cigarettes - a typical 21st-century product, a result of technology penetration into all pores of society. Their operation is based on heating a liquid (which usually contains nicotine) and creating a mixture of small particles that are released into the air.</p>","<p>The process of their use is called <strong><em>vaping </em></strong><em>(vape </em>- evaporate), and the term <em><strong>juuling</strong></em>, after one of the most popular products (not yet present in our country), is also used.</p>

<p><strong>For starters, the terminological confusion when it comes to new tobacco products needs to be clarified!</strong></p>

<p>Specifically, for the past few years, a new generation of devices has been on the market - <strong><em>Tobacco Heating Products (THP)</em></strong>, whose technology is based on heating tobacco, instead of combustion. Since these devices do not contain liquid as a nicotine medium, they are not officially classified as electronic cigarettes, with which they are usually equated. Due to the specific process of heating tobacco at high temperatures, they are called ""smokeless"", although they create a small amount of short-term visible vapor on exhalation.</p>

<p>Although manufacturers present these devices as a revolutionary <em>combination of sophisticated technology and advanced science</em> and advocate that they be declared <em>modified-risk tobacco products</em> (which was recently made official by the US Food and Drug Administration), the key point must not be forgotten:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their basic ingredient is NICOTINE, which causes addiction, and this is already more than a clear health threat!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The position of the World Health Organization (WHO) is unequivocal - electronic cigarettes and other new devices are <strong>indisputably harmful</strong>, which requires strict regulation of their use. Because...</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is still no valid evidence that electronic and ""smokeless"" devices carry a lower health risk than traditional cigarettes, neither for smokers nor for passive smokers.</li>
	<li>There is no evidence that these devices help to quit smoking. On the contrary, dual consumption of regular and electronic cigarettes is increasingly common.</li>
	<li>There is a growing number of users of electronic nicotine devices among young people.</li>

<p><strong>Almost half of the world's children breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke!</strong></p>

<p><strong>First days:</strong> Babies usually leave maternity hospitals with a weight 5-7% lower than their birth weight, and the maximum weight loss that should not worry either the parents or the health workers, if the child is healthy and suckling well, is 9-10% after 48-72 hours of life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the baseline for tracking your baby's growth, take his/her weight at discharge from the maternity hospital, rather than birth weight!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Breastfeeding moms should be patient in the first days and weeks; the baby should not be expected to start gaining weight from <a href=""https://trudnocaizdravlje.rs/ocena-bebe-na-rodenju-apgar-skor/"">the first day</a> after leaving the maternity hospital.</p>

<p>It would be good for the child to reach the birth weight around the 10th day. In the first days at home, some children's weight stagnates, until mom adjusts and the mom-baby team starts running smoothly; the key is that the baby does not lose weight or dehydrate during this period! </p>

<p><strong>At one month of age:</strong><strong> </strong>The child should weigh 600g more than at birth. If the baby has gained less weight (between 400 and 600g), do not immediately introduce supplementation. A new mom often does not have enough breastmilk in the first few days, and the baby's weight gain will thus be somewhat slower during this time. Make sure the baby is properly latched on the breast and the breastfeeding technique is good; seek professional help and advice for stimulating breastmilk production. The baby should be weighed again in a week; in seven days, the baby should gain at least 180 g (25-30 g per day).</p>

<p>For artificially-fed/formula-fed babies, observe the recommendations on the required amount of milk per meal. Strictly follow the recommendations on the hygienic preparation of formula and hygiene of the accessories (bottles, nipples).</p>

<p><strong>In the second and third months: </strong>On average, the child gains 25-30g per day; the minimum weight gain is 600g per month.</p>

<p><strong>During the second trimester (3rd to 6th month):</strong> On average, the baby gains 20 grams per day, so the monthly gain is about 600g.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the baby will grow at an even pace each month. Sometimes, he/she will have growth spurts, alternating periods of intensive growth in length and weight gain. The baby doubles the birth weight at the age of 5-6 months.</p>

<h2><strong>When to weigh a baby</strong></h2>

<p><em>For every mother, one of the worst fears is that the baby does not suckle enough, i.e. that the </em><a href=""https://trudnocaizdravlje.rs/da-li-je-moje-mleko-kvalitetno/""><em>mother does not have enough milk</em></a><em>, especially in the first days after leaving the maternity hospital. </em></p>

<p>Weighing the child daily or before and after feeding is unreliable and unnecessary; it often only brings additional confusion and insecurity. It is recommended to weigh the baby one week after leaving the maternity hospital, especially if the child is preterm, has low birth weight or recorded greater weight loss in the maternity hospital, as well as in the case of twins. Sometimes growth in the first week is minimal, but the mother notices that her milk is coming in only now (<a href=""https://trudnocaizdravlje.rs/odlozena-laktacija/"">delayed onset of lactation</a>), that she and the baby are beginning to function smoothly together only now; in this case, it is recommended to continue breastfeeding and weigh the baby again in five to seven days.</p>

<p>The infant's growth is further monitored by weighing at regular preventive examinations; if the pediatrician believes that the baby needs to be weighed more often, he/she will schedule a follow-up visit.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>What are the most common causes of failure to thrive in the first six months?</strong></strong></h2>

<p>It is not always easy to identify the reason for failure to thrive. Nevertheless, there are two main groups of causes of babies' failure to thrive in the first weeks and months of life. The first thing that should be suspected is that the baby's milk intake is insufficient. In this case, the child is nervous, wants to suckle all the time, wakes up frequently, and his/her stools are greenish, although he/she only gets breastmilk. Breastfeeding sessions last long, or the baby stops suckling already after ten minutes or so and becomes nervous, because there is nothing to suckle out.</p>

<p>The second group of reasons are diseases that may cause insufficient milk intake, as well as higher energy consumption. It is important to know that in the first weeks (sometimes even longer), the babies do not necessarily have a fever, even if they have a serious infection! Therefore, if the baby eats unenthusiastically, sleeps for an unusually long time and wakes up with difficulty for meals — you should suspect a disease!</p>

<h2><strong><strong>What to do if the baby is not thriving?</strong></strong></h2>

<p>If it is found that the baby's weight gain is insufficient, the parents must consult a pediatrician! It is the best way to determine the cause of the failure to thrive. Almost any disease in the first weeks and months of life quickly leads to the baby's failure to thrive, so it is important to consult a pediatrician to determine if the baby has a health problem that requires treatment.</p>

<h2><strong>When should I seek medical assistance?</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>In case the child sleeps too long, has difficulties waking up to be breastfed, suckles for short periods and with difficulty, falls asleep on his/her mother's chest after a few minutes — you should immediately take him/her to the pediatrician!</li>
	<li>If the baby has a fever.</li>
	<li>If the baby often vomits between breastfeeding sessions, or has multiple diarrhea-like stools.</li>
	<li>When the baby abruptly rejects the breast after a few minutes' suckling, with a scream .</li>
	<li>If the child vomits profusely after each breastfeeding session (gagging does not count — it is normal in young babies), especially in case of projectile vomiting an hour after being fed!</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the vast majority of babies thrive properly in the first months of life. Among those who do not gain enough weight, most do not get enough milk. Only a small number of babies have a disease that interferes with their normal growth and development.</p>

All babies older than six months need non-milk foods.</p>","<p>Artificially-fed children should start getting other foods a little sooner, from the 5th month of life (not before the 17th and not after the 24th week). The formula no longer fully satisfies the infant's nutritional needs and he/she begins to show interest in other foods. From the 5th month, the functions of the digestive and excretory organs are sufficiently mature, as are the motor functions that enable feeding semi-solid and solid foods to the child.</p>

<h2>Milk</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Infant formula remains the main food for the child throughout the first year.</li>
	<li>A child who has not continued breastfeeding or has been fed formula should get two cups of milk every day during the second year.</li>
	<li>Cow's milk is not recommended during the first year (the same applies to sheep's and goat's milk). It is definitely not recommended to give uncooked/unpasteurized milk to the child.</li>
	<li>Dairy products (drinking yogurt, thick yogurt, young cheese) are an excellent source of protein and calcium and can be given to children aged 7-8 months and over. The storage of dairy products is an especially important consideration, because they spoil easily and usually have a short shelf life.</li>
	<li>Plant-based beverages (soy, rice or almond milk) are not recommended as primary milk for infants, because they do not meet their nutritional needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Age 6 to 8 months</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Non-breastfed babies need the same amount of food and snacks as those who are breastfed, plus one meal and two cups of milk each day.</li>

<h2>Responsive feeding</h2>

<p>Observe your baby and respond to his/her signals. Wait for the child to stop eating before offering again. Stop feeding when he/she shows that he has had enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never use a bottle and nipple to give the child pureed food!!! This way of feeding significantly increases the risk of excessive calorie intake and obesity, and also increases the risk of caries when the child grows teeth. Only give the child water or formula in a bottle. From the 9th to the 12th month, most children are skilled enough to self-feed and drink from a cup held with both hands. Try to stop using the bottle and nipple no later than the baby's first birthday.</p>

6681,The first steps in connecting with the baby,"<p>Becoming a parent means, above all, getting to know your child and finding a way to be a source of security, acceptance and building a good image of him/herself. Sometimes we may have the impression that there are some - good enough - guidelines about children that apply to all of them, including general child care guidelines. The reality, however, is that every child is completely different and the path to becoming a good parent is, in fact, your unique experience with your own child.</p>","<p>Science says that the first step in quality parenting, as well as your child's sound development - is finding a way to connect with the baby.</p>

<p>Connecting with the baby means responding to the baby's needs with tenderness, love and care. When you behave like this, you become special to the baby, someone he/she trusts and relies on, someone he/she calms down with, learns new skills with, learns about him/herself and the world with.</p>

<p>Building a connection between you and your baby is one of the crucial aspects of development. When your baby gets what he/she needs from you: a smile, protection, cuddling, tenderness - he/she feels that he/she is safe and that the world is a safe place to learn about, play in and explore. This forms the foundation of your child's mental health, well-being and overall development during childhood and later in life.</p>

<p>In order to connect with the baby, it is important, first of all, to follow - watch, listen, notice things about your baby (what he/she likes, what calms him/her, what disturbs him/her, how he/she reacts to pain, sounds...). Next, it is important to understand your baby's ""language."" Babies usually ""speak"" by turning their eyes and head, directing their gaze or movement towards you, keeping eye contact, turning their head to the sound of your voice, making little sounds or crying, relaxed look, interested look or moving their arms and legs while in contact with you. Follow these behaviors in your child and try to respond to them.</p>

6686,You cannot spoil the baby!,"<p>In the first few months of a child's life, the baby's needs for contact with you (both voice and touch) are immense. By responding to them, you will not create bad habits, on the contrary - you will give the baby a sense of familiarity, predictability, which will result in calming down. If you calmly and constantly respond to your child's needs, he/she learns that he/she can be safe and confident, and begins to trust you.</p>","<p>Babies who do not have the experience of constant and clear response to their needs learn that they are not skilled enough to express them and that their caregivers cannot be trusted. Ignoring a baby who is crying or upset will not have the expected effect. The baby may stop crying at that moment, but he/she will actually be incredibly scared because of being left to calm down on his/her own when he/she just doesn't know how to do it yet.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<ul>
	<li>carry your baby and be physically close to him/her, especially in the first days</li>
	<li>whenever the baby cries, respond both with voice and touch</li>
	<li>whenever the baby speaks or smiles - talk to him/her, repeat his/her sounds and encourage eye contact with you</li>
	<li>whenever the baby shows an interest in something - name what he/she does and encourage him/her to succeed</li>
	<li>when the baby is anxious - show that he/she can calm down with you, with your voice, touch, movements</li>
	<li>when the baby is joyful - smile with him/her and show cheerfulness with your voice and facial expression</li>
	<li>when the baby is tired - show that you understand and that he/she can sleep and rest with you, using touch and tone of voice.</li>

6691,Positive attention,"<p>Your reactions to your child's behavior from the first days of his/her life are an important source of learning for the child. So, from the beginning, try to react with positive attention. Positive attention is the way you show warmth and enjoyment you get from your baby and your relationship with him/her. It is an important motivator and a clear encouragement for the child.</p>","<h2>How to give positive attention to the child:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Give the baby a smile when he/she looks at you. The baby will enjoy your smile, and also learn that he/she must mean a lot to you if he/she can make you smile. Your smile is a kind of ""reward"" and the baby will soon enjoy his/her skill making you smile by turning to you when you call him/her speak. This will, in turn, strengthen his/her skill of maintaining contact with you, keeping your attention and learning in the relationship with you. Something similar will happen when you look into the baby's eyes with a facial expression that shows interest and tenderness (wide eyes, smile and warm voice).</li>
	<li>Touch, cuddle and physically express tenderness in other ways. For a baby, especially in the first days of life, touch is an inexhaustible source of learning about security and an indispensable channel for connecting with people he/she will trust, with whom he/she will calm down and learn about him/herself and the world. Giving a child the opportunity to be hugged, cuddled, gently touched - means sending him/her a clear message that he/she is loved, safe, protected.</li>
	<li>Tell the baby words that speak well of the child. And until he/she understands the meanings of words, the child will be able to recognize the tone of your voice and how you speak. With a smile, words that describe the child through positive attributes will develop in the child a strong sense of acceptance, belonging and experience of self-worth.</li>
	<li>Show interest in what the child is interested in (for example, what the baby looks, points, tries to reach...), in his/her activities and achievements. You can do that, in particular, by naming the action (""Well, you are looking at a bird!""), and then participating in that activity together with the baby for a while. Try to develop the skill of ""waiting"" - to give the baby time to respond to your words, smile, call and the like. He/she will look at you, point again or try to do what he/she wants, seek your gaze and words as he/she engages in the activity, smile or make sounds and motions. Complement this experience with words that speak well of the child and his/her interests. For a child, this kind of exchange, no matter how short it may have been for you or was related to something seemingly unimportant and small, is a great source of learning about self-worth.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Positive attention teaches the baby from the first day that he/she is important, skilled, that others get enjoyment from and with him/her. This builds a positive self-image, which is the foundation of self-esteem, well-being, good relationships with others (later in life - with peers, educators, close persons) and readiness to learn and discover the world.</p>

<ul>
	<li>smile when your baby looks at you or smiles at you</li>
	<li>comfort the baby when he/she cries</li>
	<li>respond to the sounds the baby makes: tell him/her something, or imitate his/her sounds</li>
	<li>talk to the baby while keeping eye contact</li>
	<li>keep the child's attention by changing the tone of your voice or facial expression</li>
	<li>speak gently, slowly and softly</li>
	<li>follow what the baby is interested in and encourage him/her to explore - take, reach, try, throw, move, follow with his/her eyes, search: smile, name what he/she does, acknowledge his/her success with your voice and words</li>
	<li>wait for the baby's response: give the baby time to react, no matter how simple that reaction may be. When you call him/her, the baby needs time to understand what you are asking of him/her and look in your direction</li>
	<li>wait and give the baby a big smile and lots of nice words when he/she succeeds. When you talk to him/her, the baby may want to make a sound and ""tell"" you something</li>

Although this seems to happen spontaneously, the development of a quality parental alliance is, in fact, preceded by a significant number of steps.</p>","<p>Building a parental alliance begins in pregnancy, when a couple looks for ways to share experiences and feelings related to the baby's development before birth, worries and expectations from themselves as future parents.</p>

<p>A quality parental alliance is important for your family. It can provide:</p>

<ul>
	<li>shared management of the household, new child care routines and changed routines related to daily functioning.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<p>Parents who have a strong parental alliance try to talk about their feelings, especially those concerning new roles and caring for the child.

<ul>
	<li>both parents' involvement in caring for the child.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A strong parental alliance means understanding the importance of a quality relationship with both parents for the child's development. In addition, a strong parental alliance is based on the idea that both parents are equally adept at all aspects of caring for their child and that, in order to become skilled, they need time to get to know their child and establish a relationship with him/her. This is why a quality parental alliance will seek ways to ensure special time with the child for both parents.</p>

<p>Research shows that a strong parental alliance safeguards the marriage against the possible negative effects of changes in intimacy that come with parenthood.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that developing a strong parental alliance is your shared task. In pursuit of this task, you may face many challenges:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your family of origin, or your environment, may consider the mother to be a more skilled parent and may develop such expectations in you. This, in fact, creates enormous pressure and stress for both parents. Also, this belief has been refuted by science - both parents have equal chances of developing quality care for the child.</li>
	<li>you can encounter the message that the mother is expected to know and be able to do more in the daily organization and child care, and that information and knowledge about parenting is conveyed primarily to mothers. Sometimes, under the influence of such messages from advertisements, and often from professionals as well, families ""fall into the trap"" and assign the task of managing child and household care to the mother, and the ""helper"" role to the father.  You may be under the impression that there are justifications for this division of roles - the father works, the mother is at home and the like? It is important to make the decision about who will do what together, with appreciation of each other's feelings and needs, as well as to provide opportunities for both of you to get to know the child and learn how to take care of him/her.</li>

Further, for the baby, emotional security means the perception and experience that the parent is ready and able to respond to these needs.

Connecting with the baby relies primarily on getting to know him/her. This is why the first steps in developing a strong emotional bond between you are dedicated to this:</p>

<h2>Take time each day to make one-on-one contact with your baby</h2>

<p>Caring for a newborn, recovering and establishing new routines can be truly exhausting. This is why it is important to set aside at least a brief special time for you and the baby, when you do not think about other things related to the household or your other roles, a time when you are completely dedicated to getting to know and ""talking"" to the baby. Be close to the baby so that he/she can see, hear and touch you with random movements. Speak in a gentle voice, touch him/her and try to keep eye contact for as long your baby can. Your undivided attention will be a strong encouragement for the baby to learn to relax with you, share soothing, tender moments with you, and bond with you;</p>

<h2>Gently touch, cuddle, hug your baby</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Babies react strongly to touch and are very sensitive to it. Do this often, during bathing, changing, feeding routines, as well as during your special time together.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Always respond when the baby is crying</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>with your voice and by holding him/her in your arms, body movements, clasping him/her to you. This is how the baby learns that he/she can expect protection and care from you. For him/her, it is the key source of security.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Carry your baby</h2>

<ul>
	<li>While he/she is a newborn, whenever possible, hold him/her close to your body. For babies in the first days of life, skin-to-skin contact is especially important. </li>
	<li>The baby will not ""get used"" to being held or be spoiled by it. Research unequivocally shows that touch and physical contact in the first days of a baby's life is the best source of security and learning, and the best opportunity for bonding between the baby and parents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Make sure your baby is physically safe with you </h2>

<ul>
	<li>always support his/her head and neck; pay attention to how you change his/her position and what positions are best for him/her, so as to ensure the possibility of moving, watching, talking.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Talk to your baby from day one</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Keep your voice soft, quiet, soothing. There is no need to use baby talk; speak in clear words, but gently. Talk about anything, describe what you are doing, tell him/her some stories, talk about what is on your mind. In the first days, this will ensure that the baby becomes familiar with your voice, and later it will be the basis for speech development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>As you talk or sing, look the baby in the eyes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Smile widely and make clear changes of your facial expression in line with what you say and how you say it. Change the timbre and pitch of your voice as you speak. This will keep your baby's attention focused.</li>

The baby thus strengthens his/her emotional bond with you and becomes increasingly ready to explore the world around him/her and improve his/her skills.</p>

<p>Here's what you can do to strengthen the emotional bond between you and the baby at this age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>put the baby on your lap so that you can look in each other's eyes. Speak gently to him/her, look at him/her gently and smile. Keep eye contact - the look in your eyes should be gentle and smiling. Respond to the baby's reactions with a smile and words;</li>
	<li>tell the baby about what you are doing while doing the usual things around the house. The sound of your voice will calm the baby;</li>
	<li>when the baby tries to “make conversation” - by making different sounds - show that you are listening to him/her.  Smile, nod, widen your eyes. Ask questions to him/her, speak, show surprise. Your response will encourage the baby to talk further;</li>
	<li>when the baby is upset, help him/her calm down. Cuddle the baby, speak to him/her gently, put on quiet, soothing music.</li>

6721,Developing a strong emotional bond with the baby (age 6-9 months),"<p>Beyond six months of age, the baby is already very skilled in making conversation and wants to improve further, but also to use these skills to get to know the world around him/her.</p>","<p>For example, the baby will chatter and actively use different sounds, explore making new ones, imitate the ones you make. In addition, the baby will try to use motor skills to show you that you are important to him/her and that he/she needs your closeness, contact with you, joint activities: he/she will reach out to you, try to ""reach"" you, crawl after you. At this age, usually around the eighth month, the baby will show discomfort in contact with strangers and may strongly protest when held by or left with someone unfamiliar (to him/her). This ""fear of strangers"" is a common milestone in the child's emotional development and is another indicator that the child perceives his/her relationship with you as very important and different from all others.</p>

<p>Here's what you can do to strengthen the emotional bond between you at this age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>always respond when the baby moves towards you or tries to reach you. If you can't pick up or caress him/her immediately, smile at him/her and speak to him/her gently (“You want to cuddle? Wooonderful. A hug is coming, just let me put the laundry in the washing machine”);</li>
	<li>name - describe in words what the baby experiences, does, feels. Repeat these words so that the baby understands their meaning (while bathing him/her, for example: ""Are you taking a bath, yes! Do you like bathing?""). Becoming familiar with new words - names for things and phenomena - expands the vocabulary and helps the baby to actively grasp the world around him/her. The experience of understanding what your baby is feeling or doing strengthens the emotional bond between you;</li>
	<li>repeat the sounds the baby makes. These will now very often be syllables (eg. ma-ma-ma; ba-ba, etc.). By repeating his/her ""words"", you will encourage the baby to continue talking to you and thus improve his/her communication skills. The experience of being accepted and encouraged will strengthen your bond;</li>
	<li>play peekaboo with the baby. Hide your face behind your hands, and then show it to the baby again, with a smile. This will help the baby understand that you exist even when he/she cannot see you.</li>

6726,Developing a strong emotional bond with the baby (age 9-12 months),"<p>At this age, the baby is already very adept at moving, reaching and grabbing objects around him/her. He/she has clear behaviors through which he/she explores objects - he/she turns them, bangs them against the floor, throws them, puts them in his/her mouth, bangs them against each other, aligns, groups, drops them into a container and takes them out.</p>","<p>Each of these explorations brings the baby a wealth of new discoveries and new experiences, insights and feelings. That amount of new, however, can often be demanding and intimidating for the baby. He/she may need to calm down when he/she is very excited, a break from activities, a way to change activity - skills that a baby has not mastered yet. Hence, it is very important to have a lot of gentle, warm interactions with you that encourage him/her to explore further, but also help him/her understand what is around him/her, to calm down and rest. Amid all the exploration and learning, the connection with you is still the most important thing for the baby. The baby will want the exploration to happen with you and by your side - to show you what he/she is doing and to see that his/her interests are important to you, that you want to participate in them.</p>

<p>Here's how you can strengthen your emotional bond with your baby at this age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>respond to and name the baby's facial expressions or the ways in which he/she shows feelings. For example: ""Oh my, isn't that rattle a bit too noisy?"", or ""Look how tender this teddy bear is!"" This helps your baby to distinguish and understand what he/she is feeling and experiencing. Empathy and understanding of the world from the child's perspective strengthens the bond between you;</li>
	<li>recognize what the child is interested in, what he/she is trying to do, and get involved. Always name - explain in words what the baby is doing. For example, if he/she points to a book, you can say: ""It's a book. Do you want us to read a book?”</li>
	<li>allow your baby to play near you. Make sure toys, books, and other things your baby plays with are accessible to him/her — place them low on shelves or in boxes from which the baby can take them — in the living room or kitchen.</li>

6731,What is learning for a child?,"<p>Although adults may have the idea that learning means intentionally acquiring certain knowledge, from a child's perspective, learning means something else.</p>","<p>A child learns from the first day of his/her life and, already from birth, he/she is very skilled in learning about him/herself and the world around him/her at enormous speed. It is important to recognize the way a baby learns: through research and active participation in events. In addition, a baby explores most readily when he/she is strongly supported, when he/she feels safe and loved - so a strong emotional bond with you is the key foundation for his/her learning.</p>

<p>For a newborn and a baby, everything in the world is new - smells, temperature, air, colors, sounds, textures, tastes, just as everything related to the baby him/herself is new - functions such as breathing, movement, gaze, listening, directing attention, memory, speech, thinking, intentions, conclusions.</p>

<p>As the baby grows, he/she will discover that the people around him/her are connected in different ways, that there are certain patterns in relationships between people, that there are patterns between events: causes, consequences; he/she will notice many different feelings, opinions and the like, and will need and want to grasp them. All these things, and many others, require a lot of adjustment on the part of the baby. In addition, the baby tries to control his/her body, the environment and the relationships involving him/her, and is equipped for that from the first moment of life.</p>

<p>For a baby, learning means trying, exploring, touching, listening, moving a body part, seeing others' reactions, reaching out, reaching, catching, throwing, inferring the connection between things, phenomena… In that sense, for a child, learning is play, and play is at the same time the most natural way a child discovers.</p>

<p>It is very important that, as parents, you keep in mind this meaning of learning. From the first moment of his/her life, the child will show a desire to discover and an initiative to actively learn and explore. It is important to understand how your child shows initiative and communicates with his/her environment, to get to know your child, his/her reactions and the way of adjustment and learning, his/her needs for support and encouragement, to connect with your child.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The home is the child's first ""classroom"", and the parent is the first teacher, the one who will facilitate exploration and learning through play from the first day through providing adequate support and encouragement, as well as a feeling of safety to the child.</p>

6751,Talk to your baby,"<p>When a child listens to words and has an opportunity to hear the names of phenomena, experiences or activities, he/she learns the meanings of words and ways of expressing his/her thoughts or feelings. We call this process ""language nutrition"" and science offers unequivocal evidence that this type of ""nutrition"" is very important for brain development, as well as overall child development.</p>","<p>Parents are, therefore, advised to talk to the baby, read stories, sing, name everything that they do or that the baby does, sees or experiences, from the first day of their child's life. The more parents repeat words and link them to actions and things in the baby's environment and experiences, the greater the baby's ability to learn. When such opportunities are few, and talking and words in the baby's environment are scarce, the opposite happens - the records in the brain fade and the ability to learn declines.</p>

<p>Here's what you can do to provide ""language nutrition"" to your baby:</p>

<ul>
	<li>keep in mind that talking is a two-way street - pay attention to how often you encourage your baby to talk to you, talk to your baby as often as possible, follow what he/she does and name it, respond when he/she addresses you or shows interest in something</li>
	<li>whenever you are in contact with the baby, when you are rocking, cuddling, changing, bathing, playing - try to use a warm tone of voice when you address the baby. Respect the pace set by the baby: speak slowly and give your baby time to respond. Look the baby in the eyes and try to keep eye contact. Get your child's attention by changing the pitch or tempo of your speech.</li>
	<li>follow the baby and his/her reactions during your conversation: when you notice that the baby is no longer actively involved, change the type of communication. When the baby looks away, be patient and give him/her a chance to take a break and ""rejoin"" the conversation. When he/she looks at you again, greet him/her with a smiling face and words of approval. When you notice that the baby no longer enjoys the exchange, or has had enough of talking - give him/her time to rest longer and an opportunity to change the activity.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>When talking to your baby, turn off the TV, cell phone, and similar devices. Science suggests that speech that a baby just listens to is not stimulating enough.</p>

<p>On the other hand, keep in mind that the baby is the readiest for exploration and activity when he/she has your support and undivided attention. So let your conversations be situations that strengthen the bond between you.</p>

6756,Reading to the child and reading with the child,"<p>Reading is one of the ways for a child to get ""language nutrition"". This ""food"" is one of the most comprehensive ways of stimulating development, as proven by science. Reading offers words - names for things, activities, events that the child sees around him/her, his/her experiences, feelings and the like.</p>","<p>Stories offer an opportunity for a child to understand or analyze something he/she has experienced, to understand characters' behaviors, as well as the causes and consequences of those behaviors. Stories offer an opportunity for a child to reflect and establish logical connections, speak, imagine - change the course or ending of a story and the like.</p>

<p>At the mention of reading, we usually first think of a bedtime ritual. The adult takes the book and reads it aloud. The child may or may not participate in this activity and it is mainly intended to calm the child. The parent's warm voice, closeness, tenderness in this activity certainly contribute to closeness with the child.</p>

<h2><strong>Reading with a child</strong> is different</h2>

<p>It requires the child to be awake, ready to actively participate, initiate and lead the reading activity.</p>

<p>Reading with the child should take place during the day, when the child chooses that activity and is ready to explore through it. The book is then chosen by the child, and, as in any game, it is important to enable the child to lead the reading activity itself. It is important to appreciate, recognize and empower the child's ways of participating, expand the child's interest, keep the child's attention and enable true exploration and learning through playing with words and images.</p>

<h2>You can read with your child anytime and anywhere </h2>

<p>Take a book with you when you go for a walk, or for a pediatric check-up. Make books available to the child from the earliest days - put them somewhere where he/she can reach them, leave them in every room. Keep in mind that 15 minutes of reading with the child is an amount of ""language nutrition"" that will make a difference to your child's experience and development!</p>",4831,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51",59,60,"5996, 4171, 4201","6751, 4741",0,0,,en,published
6761,How to read with a child?,"<p>Reading with a child is an activity that actively involves the child and represents one of the most comprehensive development stimuli. It also offers closeness with the parent, play-like exploration, word exchange, encouragement, naming, a strong emotional experience, and an opportunity to explore and understand the objects and events surrounding the child.</p>","<p>You can read with a child from the earliest days of a baby's life. Here are some guidelines on how to read with a child, regardless of age:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the book, time and place for reading are chosen by the child. For this reason, the books that are available to the child at home should be appropriate to the child's interests and skills. Their size should be such that the child can hold them in his/her hands, pass them from hand to hand, turn them, carry them, etc. The illustrations should also be appropriate to the child. For example, baby books are usually black and white or in contrasting colors, with one large shape on a white background;</li>
	<li>the book is positioned facing the child, and the adult and the child are face to face. This allows the child to explore the book, and the parent - to observe the child's behavior, facial expressions, movements, vocalization (or speech) - initiatives that show how he/she wants to explore or participate in reading;</li>
	<li>reading is an invitation to play - with words or characters. You can help your child stay focused by changing your facial expression, tempo of speech, tone. Name what the child sees, but be sure to ask broad, open-ended questions - who, what, how, where...</li>
	<li>reading is a conversation with the child. So, give your child a chance to think of something to say. Wait for the child to answer when you ask a question. Meanwhile, watch the child's facial expression, look at him/her with interest. When the child answers and shows that he/she is ready to participate further - show approval, a cheerful face, curiosity to find out what the child thinks, discovers, says, asks;</li>
	<li>reading is an opportunity to connect with the child. So, try to speak in a warm voice, to be authentically interested in exploration together with the child. Smile, enjoy with the child and show him/her that he/she is loved, accepted and important.</li>

6766,Why is play important for a child?,"<p>Play is the most natural way for a child to explore and learn about him/herself and the world around him/her, acquire and improve the skills of movement, communication, relationships with others and draw conclusions about connections between things and beings.</p>","<p>The best way for a child to play is unstructured or free play. This play happens spontaneously and only depends on what the child is showing interest in at the moment. It enables the child to use his/her imagination and adapt the environment to him/herself - to his/her own pace, interests and the exploration modality that attracts him/her. When we think of free play, imagination and pretend games (dressing up in costumes, ""as if"" situations) usually come to mind. Free play also includes making hiding places out of blankets or boxes, cities out of boxes, playing music on real or imagined instruments and the like. Adults may or may not participate in this play.</p>

<p>Structured play is different. It has pre-agreed rules and organization, and is often run by adults (in families). Examples are board games, sports, role play, puzzles and the like.</p>

<p>Play changes with the child's age: the choice of toys, the type of play, the participation of peers and adults in play and the like change. Play will require more and more space as the child grows.</p>

<p>It is important for parents to keep in mind that, from the child's perspective, play means any research, combination, opportunities to change how things are used, to be anyone (e.g. a cook, an astronaut), at least for a short time. In that respect, from the child's perspective, play is not a planned activity that takes place at the agreed, dedicated time. The child lives play and conquers the world by playing.</p>",9616,56,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51",59,60,"76, 2426, 4121","6731, 4376",1,0,,en,published
6771,Adult participation in children's play,"<p>Your child will enjoy playing with you or near you, especially at a very young age. Adult participation in a child's play is very important at all ages.</p>","<p>Here are some guidelines for playing with your child:</p>

<h2><strong>Enable playing, let the child design it</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>for babies, this can mean setting aside one-on-one time to cuddle or talk; the baby will show initiative and start playing - by a movement, look, vocalization</li>
	<li>for older children, this means providing them with opportunities to freely manage their time and activities</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Follow the child's interests and offer encouragement</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>toys, as well as other materials for the child to  play with; these can be boxes, leaves, stones, tin and cardboard plates, old cooking pots…</li>
	<li>make them available so that the child can take them whenever he/she wants</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Introduce something new from time to time</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>it doesn't have to be a new toy at all: dress the old one differently, put it in a standing or sitting position or inside something; when you pass by it, say something - give to toy a ""voice""</li>
	<li>offer new experiences as a source of play ideas: include the child in routines (cooking, shopping), talk about some things you see during a walk, explore a part of the city, learn more about an animal he/she likes, pick up interesting things during a walk - branches, leaves, fruits…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Respect the child's initiative and leadership</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>keep in mind that play in itself makes sense to a child, even though it may seem otherwise to you</li>
	<li>accept the child, his/her skills, the way he/she sees the world, how he/she imagines and draws conclusion, and understand how he/she shows what interests him/her and what he/she wants to explore</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Work with your child to develop play</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>sometimes adults try to ""fix"" play or define a scenario for playing, to get a character's costume or figure or behavior ""right""</li>
	<li>the golden rule of play is: let the child determine the behavior, plot, course and outcome of play</li>
	<li>do not interrupt play</li>
	<li>keep in mind that play is not about a goal or achievement: to make a bridge of building blocks, but rather about what happens as we try to conceive a goal and search for a way of achieving it: who wanted to build a bridge, what was the bridge made of, what was happening while the bridge was being built, who came to build the bridge</li>
	<li>be there for the child to name what is happening, what the child and the characters in play are doing, how they are feeling, what they are experiencing</li>
	<li>be a ""mirror"" for the child, so that he/she can check his/her ideas, change and develop them.</li>

6776,Outdoor play,"<p>Time outdoors is an opportunity for your child, as well as the whole family, to have interesting experiences and adventures. Playing outdoors often means ""getting dirty"" - playing with mud, playing on the ground, collecting leaves, ""cooking grass"", writing with flowers by squeezing color out of them... Although not as clean as the usual play at home - it is much more fun!</p>","<p>Outdoor games tend to be less structured. The natural environment - meadows, forests - require the child to think of a way to explore it and have fun with it. This kind of encouragement is great for children. Likewise, where possible, outdoor games can include the child's participation in routines - tending the garden, yard, flowers and so on. A simple walk to a park can encourage the child to learn about safety, talk about the environment, observe and analyze people's behaviors and the like.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind when we think of outdoor play is - significantly less restriction on moving. Even young children, who are only learning to walk or practicing the skill of walking, and even those who crawl - can get plenty of opportunities to enjoy such occasions.</p>

<p>For very young babies, being outside means a lot of new smells, sounds, a lot of opportunities to explore different surfaces by touch, and so on. So, have a picnic with your baby - let him/her enjoy the playing while lying on a blanket on his/her tummy, crawl on the blanket and grass, watch leaves move, rustle his/her feet through leaves, or grab leaves with his/her hands . Don't forget - in these adventures, half the joy comes from the relationship with you: talk to the baby, carry him/her, help him/her reach what he/she wants, recognize his/her interest or experience and name it, encourage the baby to talk, cuddle.</p>",6141,55,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57,58",59,60,"76, 4316, 4321, 4341","6766, 6771, 6696",1,0,,en,published
6781,Common baby behaviors: crying,"<p>Babies are born with the ability to cry. For a baby, crying is the basic way of communicating with his/her environment and conveying that he/she is hungry, tired, uncomfortable, in pain, but also that he/she needs tenderness, company or comfort.</p>","<p>The baby's crying changes as he/she grows. On average, young babies cry for up to three hours a day, and 1 out of 10 babies for even longer. Babies aged 6-8 weeks cry most, and as they grow, the amount of crying should decrease. Before the sixth month, babies will cry most intensely in the late afternoon and evening. It may be comforting to know that this kind of crying usually stops by the fifth month of the baby's life. As the baby grows, crying will occur throughout the day, but will be shorter and less intense and will mostly be related to something the baby wants to tell you.</p>

<p>What to do when a baby cries? The first thing you can do is to check if he/she is hungry, tired or uncomfortable. Then it will be easy to respond to crying: you will feed him/her, put him/her to sleep or change his/her diaper. Here are a few more things you can do:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gently rock your baby. Tender movements and closeness to the parents can have a calming effect.</li>
	<li>Go for a walk with your baby (if you're not too tired for that).</li>
	<li>Bathe the baby or massage him/her gently. Touch and massage can be soothing and strengthen the bond between you. Ask your health visitor how to safely massage your baby.</li>
	<li>Talk to your baby softly, sing to him/her or play quiet music while rocking or cuddling him/her. Sometimes noises and sounds of appliances such as hair dryers or vacuum cleaners can calm the baby.</li>
	<li>Calm your baby by reducing stimulation - dim the lights, for example.</li>
</ul>

<p>A baby's crying can be very distressing for parents and they may feel scared, angry or stressed. Try to find time to walk, read a book, enjoy exercising or bathing - at least briefly. When your baby is crying and you feel that you can't take it anymore, put the baby in a safe place and leave the room. Never shake the baby - it can lead to dangerous brain injuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seek help and talk openly about your feelings. Although it is important to believe that you are doing everything you can and that crying will pass, when babies cry for a long time and intensely, many parents will feel tired and nervous. It is, therefore, important to seek advice and talk about what you are experiencing and how you are reacting.</p>

6786,Baby and young child behaviors that may worry you: fear of strangers,"<p>Your baby may show discomfort when held or approached and addressed by a person unfamiliar to him/her. This behavior is common and usually occurs between 7-10 months of age. It can last several months, but may also continue for longer. It usually passes when the child is 18-24 months old.</p>","<h2>What can you do?</h2>

<p>Although fear of strangers is expected during development, you can help your child feel less uncomfortable.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not ignore and reject the baby's discomfort. The baby may cry and react even more intensely out of the need to show you more clearly what he/she is going through.</li>
	<li>Hold the baby’s hand, or hold him/her on your lap when introduced to new people. Whenever possible, introduce new people in a familiar environment - in your home, for example.</li>
	<li>If the baby is very uncomfortable with a new person, comfort and calm him/her down completely, and only then try, for example, to play all together. To begin with, move the baby away from the new person.</li>
	<li>Be patient and gentle. Do not insist on contact between the baby and the new person. Don't worry too much about how adults feel - ask strangers to wait before taking the baby in their arms. Say the baby is learning to meet new people and give the baby time to get to know and want contact with the new person.</li>
	<li>Be calm - neither too happy, excited, nor worried - when you introduce the baby to new people. The baby will observe your behavior and assess the situation based on your reactions.</li>
	<li>Don’t give up on meeting new people, on the contrary. Put your baby in situations to meet new people. Always greet them cordially, letting the baby know - with a smile, pleasant, cheerful voice, eye contact - that the contact with the new person is pleasant.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely strong fear of strangers may lead to social anxiety and discomfort in social relations when the child is older. It is, therefore, important to seek professional advice if you are concerned that the discomfort your baby experiences when meeting new people is very intense or the baby does not calm down even when the stranger leaves. Also seek advice if the fear of strangers persists beyond the second year of the child's life.</p>

<p>The child will mostly ""warm up"" as he/she spends time with the person, or becomes familiar with the situation in which he/she finds him/herself. Sometimes, shyness will not disappear completely, but the child will be increasingly at ease and confident when communicating with others.</p>

<p><em>What can you do?</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>give your baby or young child time to feel comfortable. Do not insist on contact (either physical - picking him/her up, kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or verbal - answering questions);</li>
	<li>let the child know that his/her feelings are okay, name them and make it clear that together you will find a way to make the child feel more comfortable (for example, you can say: ""I see that you are a little afraid because you don't know these children. Let's first go together and see what's there"");</li>
	<li>be with the baby or young child in new situations or situations that require interaction (such as playgrounds, playrooms). During this time, support the child in exploring the space, toys. Always praise ""brave"" behaviors - when a child responds, looks at a person, tries something new, makes contact or plays away from you or with someone;</li>
	<li>be calm and restrained - do not reject the child, but do not comfort him/her too much. Try to present the situation as a normal one, while at the same time showing that you understand that the child feels uncomfortable and that you are there to find a way to make him/her feel better together. Set an example for the child, so that he/she can learn by observing your reactions, adjustments and behavior (for example, when someone addresses you - respond);</li>
	<li>""Take your child's side."" If someone calls him/her shy in his/her presence, feel free to correct him/her in front of the child: ""He/she needs some time to warm up and get to know everyone.

This sends a message to the child that you understand how he/she feels, you accept him/her and you are sure that he/she will handle this situation skillfully.</li>
</ul>

<p>When is shyness a problem? Sometimes shyness can develop into anxiety - excessive worry. If the child has pronounced shyness that interferes with his/her and your functioning (he/she cannot go to certain places, avoids situations that require contact, shows fear or discomfort on playgrounds, in playrooms, etc.) and there is no change, seek professional advice.</p>",5166,56,"46,47,48,49,50,51,52,57",59,60,4866,"3641, 3646, 3656",1,0,,en,published
6856,Usual behavior of a preschooler (3-6 years): What to expect?,"<p>Children beyond the age of three are already experienced explorers of the world around them. They are very curious and often ask series of questions. Also, they can now be very focused on things that attract their attention: for example, following a row of ants moving on a tree by the road you are passing.</p>","<p>This is why it's important to allow them enough time for it: go for a walk or leave for your destination early, to allow your child to discover without hindrance. In addition, it is common for a child of this age to want more independence in both behavior and decision-making. They really need your support, as well as opportunities to do things independently, or to make decisions about things important to them (eg. what to give a friend as a birthday present, what to wear to kindergarten, where to go for a walk in the afternoon, etc.). Both your support and these opportunities build the child's feeling of self-confidence, so with positive attention, praise and a sense of security with you - they become great opportunities for practicing skills and exploring new ones.</p>

<p>At this age, play is very rich and imaginative. While playing, the child skillfully explores further and experiences the situations he/she encounters every day, attributes human behavior to animals and dolls, analyzes different relationships and behaviors and draws conclusions about it in play - tries out various consequences, enacts feelings and the like.</p>

<p>At this age, children continue to learn very quickly. There are very stimulating learning opportunities in the usual home routines (for example in preparing meals, shopping, planning leisure time, visits and socializing, setting the table...); they rely on the child's participation and positive attention - parents' skills to support and expand the child's experience, praise the child's engagement, curiosity, dexterity...</p>

<p>Children at this age experience many positive effects of joint activities with peers. Playing with peers, especially in mixed groups (groups of different ages), offers numerous opportunities to explore and learn about themselves and the world, especially interpersonal relationships. For this reason, it is important for children to start kindergarten at this age. When your child starts kindergarten, keep in mind that he/she will need your support to understand and accept his/her new role, new routines, to get to know the adults and peers around him/her and to make daily transitions from the ""kindergarten reality"" to the home reality and routines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your child's emotions are very strong at this age, they change quickly and the child is still learning to understand and manage them. Hence, it can still be very challenging for the child to regulate his/her behavior in challenging situations - when there is a source of frustration, fear or anger. You can help him/her with this big and important task by talking openly about feelings: expressing and naming your different feelings, as well as offering the child a name for his/her or a peer's feelings.</p>

6861,Self-regulation skills in children,"<p>In brief, self-regulation is the skill of managing one's own behavior and understanding one's own feelings and reactions.</p>","<h2>Self-regulation includes the skills to:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>recognize and regulate feelings of excitement and frustration</li>
	<li>calm down after an interesting or disturbing event</li>
	<li>focus on the task</li>
	<li>shift focus on another task</li>
	<li>control impulses and postpone needs</li>
	<li>learn behaviors that are useful in interacting with other people.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Self-regulation skills are important:  </h2>

<ul>
	<li>for learning (focusing on the teacher and the task, for example),</li>
	<li>for managing relationships with others (socializing relies on the skill of engaging in joint play and activities, taking turns, expressing feelings in an acceptable way, for example),</li>
	<li>for behaving in an acceptable way (controlling our impulses and postponing some needs),</li>
	<li>for being more independent (making decisions and managing our behavior),</li>
	<li>for successfully coping with stress and strong negative emotions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Self-regulation develops from the earliest days: babies suck their thumbs to calm down, or look away from you when they need a break from talking to you, but it develops most intensively after the second year of life and beyond, until adulthood. Thus, children up to the age of 3 can already briefly postpone the need for food, but they still readily snatch a toy that they like on the playground, or throw tantrums when they express dissatisfaction and frustration.</p>

<p>Children aged 3-6 will be more and more skilled in playing together with their peers - they will be better able to balance their wishes and ideas with those of others. Also, they are more willing to follow some rules of conduct - e.g. to whisper in the cinema. At the same time, they still find it difficult to focus completely on their task, or to manage strong feelings such as anger or jealousy. As they start school, they become more and more skilled in understanding the perspective of others and arguing their opinion; they get better at expressing disagreement without quarreling.</p>

<p>Self-regulation develops in warm, supportive and stimulating relationships; therefore:</p>

<ul>
	<li>talk to the child about how he/she feels and analyze the behavior related to the feelings (eg. why he/she got angry and how he/she behaved then, what else he/she could have done)</li>
	<li>when a child is struggling with a strong emotion (usually fear or anger), help him/her name the feeling. It helps if this conversation takes place when the child calms down.</li>
	<li>help your child find a good way to calm down and offer to help him/her calm down when he is struggling with strong feelings</li>
	<li>set an example for the child, name what you do when you are upset or frustrated by something</li>
	<li>use positive attention and always praise and emphasize the child's success in self-regulation (you waited in line very well, I liked it when you asked for a toy and waited for him to be done playing…)</li>
	<li>try to adjust your expectations to the child's skills; this way, you help the child become capable of resolving the challenges he/she faces </li>
	<li>be very patient, it is very difficult for young children to understand and cope with a flood of emotions.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>When to be concerned?</strong></h2>

<p>Some behaviors related to self-regulation may require you to consult a professional. Be sure to do this if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>your child has tantrums and finds it difficult to cope with strong feelings more often than other children of the same age</li>
	<li>the older he/she is, the more difficult it is for your child to cope with strong feelings</li>
	<li>when overwhelmed by strong emotions, your child's behaviors endanger him/her or others</li>
	<li>you can't find a good strategy to help your child manage his/her behavior and reactions</li>
	<li>your child becomes very withdrawn and shows fewer social skills compared to his/her peers.</li>

Earwax is yellowish in babies, it does not need to be cleaned, it has its functions (it moisturizes the skin of the ear and at the same time binds dirt and dust), it contains indispensable antibacterial substances. Always maintain ear hygiene after bathing, by wiping the outer ears gently with the tip of a cotton towel to clean them as far as you can reach. Avoid cotton buds (do not even use those with a stopper), as they can injure the baby or cause an infection. Wipe the area behind the outer ear with a cotton pad soaked in warm water every night because milk will trickle behind the ear during feeding.</p>

<p>The baby's nose cleans itself, as mucus binds the dirt and removes it. Additional nose care is needed only if the nose secretes too much mucus, which happens when the baby catches a cold. Saline solution is used for rinsing the nose: </p>

<ul>
	<li>lay the baby on his/her side, </li>
	<li>put a few drops of saline solution in the upper nostril or spray the same solution in,</li>
	<li>elevate the baby slightly, with his/her head facing down, supporting him/her with your arm, and pat him/her lightly on the back so that the mucus flows out or becomes visible,</li>
	<li>if the mucus can be heard but not seen, put the saline solution in his/her nose again,</li>
	<li>turn the baby face down and, when the mucus becomes visible, pull it out with a twisted corner of a cloth diaper or a dry cotton bud,</li>
	<li>after a few minutes, repeat the procedure in the other nostril, with the baby lying on the other side,</li>
	<li>if necessary, nose cleaning can be performed before each breastfeeding session.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Cotton buds should never be inserted in the nostril. Do not use pumps and aspirators to clean a heathy child's nose - only use them when the baby is sick and has a lot of mucus. If your baby is struggling to breastfeed or refuses to breastfeed due to a stuffy nose, consult a pediatrician.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cold sea water will not affect breastfeeding, nor does sea water contain any ingredients that would affect breastmilk production.</li>
	<li>You will enjoy swimming even more than usual; it will alleviate the back pain that every mother feels, and it can also contribute to the loss of any excess weight</li>
	<li>Sunbathing has no effect on breastfeeding; take care that your breasts or areolas do not get sunburned, because it can be very painful</li>
	<li>Sunscreens do not enter the bloodstream in larger quantities; nevertheless, using a herbal one is recommended. When applying the sunscreen, be careful not to apply it on the areas from which the baby could ingest it.</li>
	<li>Do not use self-tanning products during breastfeeding</li>
	<li>After swimming, change out of your wet bathing suit; the moisture retained around the nipples in a synthetic suit is conducive to the development of fungal infections (thrush)</li>
	<li>If you are breastfeeding on the beach, wash your breasts with fresh water before breastfeeding to wash away sweat, sand and sea salt. Sit comfortably in the shade with your baby, if it will make you feel more comfortable, cover yourself with a light scarf.</li>

<h2><strong>Do I need to breastfeed my baby more often during the summer vacation?</strong></h2>

<p>In summer heat, babies also have an increased need for fluids. An exclusively breastfed baby gets water only from breastmilk, so he/she needs to be offered to suckle more often. The child him/herself will ask to suckle more often; don't be surprised if these feeds are short; your baby is thirsty, not hungry, so foremilk, with a higher water content, is enough. If your child is already getting solid food, after the age of 6 months, give him/her water to drink more often.</p>",2246,1,"43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50",59,60,"2686, 5531","5691, 5686",0,0,"<p>CDC.

I can choose what I want to do, tell you that and you can understand me. There are so many interesting things all around me, and I have many, many questions!  It means a lot to me that you are answering all my questions. I can recognize more and more of my feelings,  and I can control them better—but not perfectly, of course. I know when I'm happy and when I'm sad. I know what scares me and what makes me happy. It’s hard for me to accept that things can’t always be the way I want them to be. I watch your reactions carefully. When something is difficult for me, your understanding, explanation and patience help me get through the difficult time. I like to play - alone and with others. I like to be outside, with other children. I am glad that I can do so many things all by myself now, or with a little help from you—things like eating, putting on my shoes, and washing my hands.  It makes me feel like a bigger girl!”","<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month</strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>From the third to the fourth birthday is an intensive time for your child’s speech to develop.  She will learn many <strong>new words</strong> by listening to you and other adults, and also by listening to stories.  At this age, she is more interested in all kinds of communication.  She is eager to just <strong>tell you stories</strong> or describe things that happen.  You can see how much she enjoys your conversations. During this period, she will <strong>understand most of the things you say</strong> to her, and may be able to guess what some new words mean.  You will also notice that, by the end of this year, your child’s sentences will be longer.  She will also be able to follow more <strong>complex instructions </strong>with two or three parts, such as “Please close the door and come with me.”</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>As always, listen to your child and have enjoyable conversations at all times of the day.  You will find that at this age, your child has a lot to talk about!  Involve her in whatever you are doing and use this as an opportunity to playfully give her instructions or introduce interesting new words into the conversation.   Read and tell stories with your child every day.  You can ask her about the story—what does she think will happen next? </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>The period from the third to the fourth birthday is very important for your child’s emotional development. During this period, she learns how <strong>to identify different emotions</strong>.  At this age, she may be able to recognize basic feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger.  You might see her show some other emotions such as fear of imaginary things, concern or worry about how others behave, or love and attachment to people she feels close to.</p>

<p>If she has the opportunity you will see your child making her <strong>first friends</strong> during this year.  Now she will probably begin to <strong>play more cooperatively</strong> with others, in small groups.   Sharing is becoming easier—though not always—as she has some understanding of “mine” and “hers.” </p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Continue to create a secure environment for your child.  This makes it easier for her to express and regulate or control her feelings.  As when she was younger, predictable daily routines help create that sense of security.  Help your child know what happens next and what the typical pattern of the day will be.  If she feels safe, it will be.</p>

<p>Because these first friendships are important to your child, try to create opportunities for play with other children.  But stay close to the children, because the child’s social skills at this age are still not well developed, and misunderstandings or conflicts may happen.  You will help by reacting calmly and reasonably.</p>

<p>Play is still the dominant way in which a child of this age learns and explores herself and the world around her, but now your child’s “playful learning”  is becoming <strong>much more imaginative</strong>.  She might have a tea party or pretend to be a doctor with a sick baby.  Some children have imaginary friends at this age.  For the most part, although she loves to pretend, she knows what it real and what’s make-believe.  This is also a period of intense <strong>fascination with the world</strong> around your child.  <strong>Questions, questions, questions</strong> help her learn—who?  What?  why?  She is probably very interested in her own body and others’ bodies. </p>

<p>This year your child will also develop ideas about  opposites such as big / small, and more/less, as well as  other <strong>concepts</strong> such as “on”, “in,” and “below.”  Her memory is developing, allowing her to  learn short songs and sing them later. She will also begin to point to and name <strong>some letters and numbers</strong>.   By her fourth birthday, she’ll probably count as many as four objects and group different objects by their similar color and shape.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Accept your child’s many questions as her important efforts to learn about the world.  Try to answer simply and honestly without giving too complex  explanations.  If you do not know something, say so.  Show your child ways to find out information—for example, if she asks about birds that she sees, you may find a book or talk with a neighbor who knows all about birds.  Always offer to find the answer together in books or other sources of information.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Between the age of three and four, your child is <strong>very physically active</strong>.  You can see how much she enjoys all kinds of movements.  She has become better at running, climbing, jumping, and balancing on one leg.  She can catch a ball that’s bounced to her, most of the time.  If there are stairs in her environment, she’s better at going up them. </p>

<p>In other ways, your child is becoming <strong>more independent</strong>. She eats on her own, mostly is able to dress herself, uses the toilet independently, and washes herself. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Supervise and help with parts of her personal care that are still difficult, like brushing teeth.  Watch carefully as she climbs, allowing her independence but monitoring her safety.  Give your child the opportunity to try different kinds of activities – those with a lot of movement, and those that are calmer such as drawing and looking at books.  Teach your child traditional outdoor games; dance with her and copy her movements as she can copy yours.  Support activities that your child enjoys.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 37th to the 48th month</strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it’s impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please don’t be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your pediatrician [or other health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Shows no interest in playing games with others or playing make-believe/pretend games</li>
	<li>Ignores other children or does not respond to people outside the family</li>
	<li>Can't jump in place</li>
	<li>Has difficulty scribbling (making marks on paper)</li>
	<li>Does not follow an instruction that has three parts</li>
	<li>Can't tell a favorite story</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>At this age, your child probably <strong>talks a lot</strong>, with other people and even when he is alone in the room. You will now hear your child use <strong>full complex sentences.</strong>  Sometimes he can lead a conversation almost like an adult, but sometimes he still has a hard time explaining complex ideas or complex events. Now he understands jokes and riddles.  You’ll notice how many <strong>new words</strong> your child is learning every day.  He likes to use these words, but his brain sometimes works faster than he can say them—that’s all right, he’ll catch up soon. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Continue to have conversations with your child every day.  His new experiences and interests give you a lot to talk about together.  If he struggles with how to explain or pronounce something, gently help him out without criticizing his efforts. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feeling.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your child continues to love pretending, but now his <strong>make-believe is much more complex</strong> and dramatic.  Much of his play will be with friends, working together—for example, to make one big sand castle or a pretend house in the garden. He’ll usually be able to share his things, although he won’t always get along with his playmates.  Children may say that others are not following the rules of a game, or other conflicts may happen.  But now your child may be able to <strong>try to solve these conflicts</strong>.  Your child manages his emotions better than at earlier ages, is <strong>more patient and reasonable</strong>, and you’ll see fewer outbursts of anger or overflows of grief.  Disagreements will be fewer and more easily resolved.    </p>

<p>As your child grows and his understanding of the world gets better, <strong>certain fears</strong> may arise. This age is characterized by fears of supernatural beings (ghosts), criticism, failure, physical injury or threat.</p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>During this period, your child may need your support to understand more complex feelings such as frustration or jealousy.  This is important in his understanding of some of the challenges that will come up in preschool/school and in dealing with friendships.  Stories from books or your own experience may help.</p>

<p>Your child is trying hard to be independent.  You can help in encouraging him to make many small decisions (what to wear, what to eat for breakfast, etc.).  Although your child may seem to be very independent in this period, he still needs to connect with you and have your love, care and attention. He is proud of what he is able to do, but he still looks for your approval and probably still finds it difficult to bear criticism and discipline.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Your child is now able to <strong>sustain attention to tasks</strong> for longer periods, at home or in preschool/school if he has begun preschool/school at this time.   He understands simple concepts such as time (present, future, past), knows the seasons, recognizes <strong>some letters of the alphabet</strong> and tries to read them, and can write a word such as his name.  Some children can already read at this age.  He can tell you his age, and he’s probably able to count ten objects.  As his thinking develops, you’ll see that he is able to <strong>see things from others’ points of view</strong>.  This can help him make friends (“My friend likes animals, so let’s pretend to be horses”).  He is also able to use these thinking skills to feel what another person is feeling (empathy)—“I’m sad because my father looks sad.” </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>

<p>Play continues to be the most important way that your child learns new things.  Read and tell stories together to develop love of words and understanding of reading.  Let him use pencils to write or pretend-write shopping lists or letters to grandparents.  Count objects as you do everyday tasks.  Some children are beginning preschool/school at this time.  If this is your child’s first experience, it will open a whole new social world, and with it a whole set of new rules to learn. This can be challenging for your child.  He may be worried or upset; you can help by reassuring him, telling positive stories about preschool/school, and—if you see the need—sharing your concerns with your child’s teacher.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your child’s <strong>movements are more coordinated</strong> now.  Depending on your environment, he may learn to ride a bike, jump over a rope, jump, and skillfully catch a ball. </p>

<p>Sometimes it may seem to you that your child never rests - he may <strong>wiggle and fidget</strong> while watching TV, eating at the table and even while sleeping.  He has lots of energy at this age! Your child’s <strong>fine motor skills are also becoming more precise</strong> - now he can fasten shoelaces, button, zip up a comb his hair, and so on. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Within your community environment, find ways for your child to learn and practice new physical skills by himself or with friends.  You may have some traditional games that your family can teach him.  Find many ways for him to use that physical energy in safe, appropriate ways.  Encourage him to use his fine motor skills not only in dressing himself but perhaps in helping a younger brother or sister.  He will enjoy feeling important.</p>

	<li>Doesn’t speak clearly in sentences of 5 or more words</li>
	<li>Doesn’t tell longer stories using complete sentences</li>
	<li>Doesn’t dress and use toilet without help</li>
	<li>Can’t take part in conversations</li>
	<li>Can’t play in more than one way</li>
	<li>Can’t give his name and address</li>
	<li>Can’t stand or hop on one foot</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a period in which you can probably worry about whether some of the listed behaviors are related to spending time in front of the screen. Be sure to limit the time in front of the screen to a maximum of one hour a day and make sure you spend every moment in front of the screen with your child to guide him through that experience. </p>

“Now I am four years old and soon I will be five!  There is so much I can do on my own, and yet I learn so many new things every day. Everything is interesting to me. I would like to try everything! I am proud when I do something, and I love it when you rejoice, too. I control my feelings and wishes better and better, even though it is hard sometimes. I understand almost everything you tell me and I enjoy talking. I like to talk - about what we did and where we were. Let's plan what we'll do tomorrow. I like you to tell stories or read books to me, so I can imagine that I’m one of the people or animals in the story. I also love when we sing songs or make believe together. I have ‘best friends’ that I love to play with. I know the rules and how to behave, but sometimes I forget. When you are angry at me, it makes me feel ashamed or worried, so sometimes I may try to hide what I have done or tell you something that is not true.

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>This is a period of rapid speech development, exciting to you and your child.  At this age, your child probably <strong>loves telling stories and enjoys conversations</strong>.  Your child may often talk about how he feels, tell about his ideas, and ask questions. </p>

<p>At the beginning of this year, he may know several hundred words and can use sentences of at least five or six words.  Usually you'll understand what he is saying.  And by his fifth birthday, his sentences will be longer and even more complex, with <strong>many more words</strong> available to him.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Every child is different—your child may be  talkative or more quiet.  Whatever his style, always encourage his verbal expression. If you talk to him in everyday conversation, he will want to talk to you more.  If he sees that you enjoy talking with him, he'll begin to enjoy it too. Be patient--your child will still not be able to express himself well, so sometimes you'll need to help a bit: „Oh, is that what you played with your friend?  What else did you do?  Did you throw the ball?“ Talk about ordinary things that happen - what we do, where we have been, what we plan, what we like and what we don't. While reading books or telling stories, you can ask questions about what is happening.  Drawing and playing pretend are other ways to communicate and may support children who are sometimes unwilling to talk.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>

<p>During this period, your child begins to learn how to <strong>express different feelings </strong>in an appropriate way.  He can find more and more ways to express emotions–  speech, explanation, gestures, or  play. Increasingly, he will be able to say what bothers him instead of yelling or hitting. </p>

<p>During this period, children usually like to be <strong>surrounded by other people</strong>. You may see your child wanting to please his friends and wanting to be just like them.  Imaginary friends may still be an important part of your child's growing up, although real friends are the most important to him.  He is beginning to get along better and better with others.  You're likely to see him apologize, accept rules, wait for turns, and enjoy it when nice things happen to others.  Even though he can still be rather demanding or impatient, he more often <strong>cooperates and wants to help</strong> others.  At the same time, he may <strong>worry about new experiences</strong>, such as beginning preschool or playing with new children.</p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Encourage your child to be involved in various activities such as family routines, play, and socializing with other children. Share his enjoyment.  Create opportunities in which the child will feel useful and important- a little help while doing household chores, followed by praise, will encourage him to develop self-confidence. Avoid criticism, and praise the effort. If help is needed, give clear instructions and explanations.</p>

<p>If he avoids trying something new or is already afraid of starting preschool, let him become familiar with the new situation and give it a try when he is ready.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Play is still a way for a child to learn about himself and about the world around him.   At this age your child will use his<strong> imagination</strong> intensively.  He will probably love to sing, dance, and pretend.  He is better able to know the difference between what is pretend and what is real.   However, at the same time he may <strong>hide the truth</strong> from his parents if he has done something he knows they do not like.  In his play, he may try <strong>different roles and behaviors</strong> - such as a doctor or a teacher.  During this period he may become more aware of his gender and gender roles.  </p>

<p>Your child's learning also includes learning about his own body and other's bodies—including curiosity about boys' and girls' bodies.  Interest and curiosity about the body continues - both theirs and other people's bodies. You can find a child of this age watching his genitals or the genitals of other children with interest. </p>

<p><strong> Concepts </strong>develop rapidly in this period and are foundational for later learning.  Your child in understanding more about  opposites (for example, low / high), and he can usually name quite a few <strong>letters and numbers</strong>, and print some of them.  He can correctly count objects up to 10.  His memory's getting better.  He probably remembers his address or phone number.  He may know the difference between left and right. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>In conversation and daily routines, talk about time concepts (morning, evening, today, etc. and days of the week), as well as other interesting concepts.  Use stories and children’s books to explore other concepts.  Enrich story reading or storytelling by asking your child what he thinks might happen next. Take walks around the community to explore sights and sounds that stimulate his thinking.  Create opportunities to use letters and numbers in daily activities, such as writing a note to help you remember foods to buy at the market. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your child is <strong>more and more physically skilled</strong> – now he can throw, catch, swing and climb, and build a tower with several small objects.  He can probably hop and perhaps even skip.  He finds it easier to <strong>dress himself</strong> now.  He's also able <strong>take care of more of his own needs</strong>.  For example, he may feed himself using a spoon or other utensils.  He may use the toilet independently and can brush his teeth wash himself without much help. </p>

<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>

<p>Remind him of safety rules and be sure to supervise physical activities as needed.  Create opportunities for your child to be active outdoors and teach him skills as he becomes eager to learn them.  Encourage him fine motor skills by providing simple materials for him to put together, and to draw pictures. </p>

6956,"49 - 60 months - The Joy of Learning, Connecting, and Experimenting","If I Could Tell You . . .
“Now I am four years old and soon I will be five!  There is so much I can do on my own, and yet I learn so many new things every day. Everything is interesting to me. I would like to try everything! I am proud when I do something, and I love it when you rejoice, too. I control my feelings and wishes better and better, even though it is hard sometimes. I understand almost everything you tell me and I enjoy talking. I like to talk - about what we did and where we were. Let's plan what we'll do tomorrow. I like you to tell stories or read books to me, so I can imagine that I’m one of the people or animals in the story. I also love when we sing songs or make believe together. I have ‘best friends’ that I love to play with. I know the rules and how to behave, but sometimes I forget. When you are angry at me, it makes me feel ashamed or worried, so sometimes I may try to hide what I have done or tell you something that is not true. One other thing – now I can swing and climb really well. ”","<h1><strong>Child development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>This is a period of rapid speech development, exciting to you and your child.  At this age, your child probably <strong>loves telling stories and enjoys conversations</strong>.  Your child may often talk about how she feels, tell about her ideas, and ask questions. </p>

<p>At the beginning of this year, she may know several hundred words and can use sentences of at least five or six words.  Usually you'll understand what she is saying.  And by her fifth birthday, her sentences will be longer and even more complex, with <strong>many more words</strong> available to her.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Every child is different—your child may be  talkative or more quiet.  Whatever her style, always encourage her verbal expression. If you talk to her in everyday conversation, she will want to talk to you more.  If she sees that you enjoy talking with her, she'll begin to enjoy it too. Be patient--your child will still not be able to express herself well, so sometimes you'll need to help a bit: „Oh, is that what you played with your friend?  What else did you do?  Did you throw the ball?“ Talk about ordinary things that happen - what we do, where we have been, what we plan, what we like and what we don't. While reading books or telling stories, you can ask questions about what is happening.  Drawing and playing pretend are other ways to communicate and may support children who are sometimes unwilling to talk.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>During this period, your child begins to learn how to <strong>express different feelings </strong>in an appropriate way. She can find more and more ways to express emotions– speech, explanation, gestures, or play. Increasingly, she will be able to say what bothers her instead of yelling or hitting. </p>

<p>During this period, children usually like to be <strong>surrounded by other people</strong>. You may see your child wanting to please her friends and wanting to be just like them.  Imaginary friends may still be an important part of your child's growing up, although real friends are the most important to her.  She is beginning to get along better and better with others.  You're likely to see her apologize, accept rules, wait for turns, and enjoy it when nice things happen to others.  Even though she can still be rather demanding or impatient, she more often <strong>cooperates and wants to help</strong> others.  At the same time, she may <strong>worry about new experiences</strong>, such as beginning preschool or playing with new children.</p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Encourage your child to be involved in various activities such as family routines, play, and socializing with other children. Share her enjoyment.  Create opportunities in which the child will feel useful and important- a little help while doing household chores, followed by praise, will encourage her to develop self-confidence. Avoid criticism, and praise the effort. If help is needed, give clear instructions and explanations.</p>

<p>If she avoids trying something new or is already afraid of starting preschool, let her become familiar with the new situation and give it a try when she is ready.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Play is still a way for a child to learn about herself and about the world around her. At this age, your child will use her<strong> imagination</strong> intensively.  She will probably love to sing, dance, and pretend.  She is better able to know the difference between what is pretend and what is real.   However, at the same time, she may <strong>hide the truth</strong> from her parents if she has done something she knows they do not like.  In her play, she may try <strong>different roles and behaviours</strong> - such as a doctor or a teacher.  During this period she may become more aware of her gender and gender roles.  </p>

<p>Your child's learning also includes learning about her own body and other's bodies—including curiosity about boys' and girls' bodies. Interest and curiosity about the body continue - both theirs and other people's bodies. You can find a child of this age watching her genitals or the genitals of other children with interest. </p>

<p><strong> Concepts </strong>develop rapidly in this period and are foundational for later learning.  Your child is understanding more about opposites (for example, low/high), and she can usually name quite a few <strong>letters and numbers</strong>, and print some of them.  She can correctly count objects up to 10.  Her memory's getting better.  She probably remembers her address or phone number.  She may know the difference between left and right. </p>

<p> </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>In conversation and daily routines, talk about time concepts (morning, evening, today, etc. and days of the week), as well as other interesting concepts.  Use stories and children’s books to explore other concepts.  Enrich story reading or storytelling by asking your child what she thinks might happen next. Take walks around the community to explore sights and sounds that stimulate her thinking.  Create opportunities to use letters and numbers in daily activities, such as writing a note to help you remember foods to buy at the market. </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Your child is <strong>more and more physically skilled</strong> – now she can throw, catch, swing and climb, and build a tower with several small objects.  She can probably hop and perhaps even skip.  She finds it easier to <strong>dress herself</strong> now.  She's also able to <strong>take care of more of her own needs</strong>.  For example, she may feed herself using a spoon or other utensils.  She may use the toilet independently and can brush her teeth wash herself without much help. </p>

<p><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></p>

<p>Remind her of safety rules and be sure to supervise physical activities as needed.  Create opportunities for your child to be active outdoors and teach her skills as she becomes eager to learn them.  Encourage her fine motor skills by providing simple materials for her to put together, and to draw pictures. </p>

<h2><strong> Parents’ concerns about development in the period from the 49th to the 60th month</strong></h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Because each child develops in her own particular way, it is impossible to predict exactly when or how your own child will perfect a certain skill. <strong>The abilities (developmental milestones)</strong> expected and listed for this period give you only a general idea of the changes you might expect as your child gets older.  Please do not be worried if her development takes a slightly different path.</p>

<p>However, to be sure, do talk with your paediatrician [or another health provider] if your child displays any of the following signs of possible developmental delay, if your child seems to have lost some of the skills she had at an earlier age, or if you have other reasons to be concerned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Can't confidently walk, run, climb, jump or use stairs </li>
	<li>Can't answer simple questions (What's your name? Who is your family? What's your favourite story?)</li>
	<li>Can't follow a two-part direction (Put a cup on the table! Or Take the ball under the bed!) </li>
	<li>Can't perform daily routines such as eating or dressing on her own </li>
	<li>Seems to have difficulty holding a pencil</li>
	<li>Shows extreme behaviour (such as extremely fearful, or aggressive, or sad)</li>
	<li>Doesn’t talk about daily activities</li>
	<li>Doesn't show interest in interacting with either adults or children</li>

6961,37-48 months –  Asking questions,"If I could tell you...
""That's me. I know my name and how old I am—I’m three now, and soon I will be four!  I know the names of my mom and dad. I'm happy. Now I can say what I need, what I like and what I don't. I can choose what I want to do, tell you that and you can understand me. There are so many interesting things all around me, and I have many, many questions!  It means a lot to me that you are answering all my questions. I can recognize more and more of my feelings,  and I can control them better—but not perfectly, of course. I know when I'm happy and when I'm sad. I know what scares me and what makes me happy. It’s hard for me to accept that things can’t always be the way I want them to be. I watch your reactions carefully. When something is difficult for me, your understanding, explanation and patience help me get through the difficult time. I like to play - alone and with others. I like to be outside, with other children. I am glad that I can do so many things all by myself now, or with a little help from you—things like eating, putting on my shoes, and washing my hands.  It makes me feel like a bigger boy! “","<h1><strong>Child Development in the period from the 37th to the 38th month </strong></h1>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Communicating.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?  </strong></h3>

<p>From the third to the fourth birthday is an intensive time for your child’s speech to develop.  He will learn many <strong>new words</strong> by listening to you and other adults, and also by listening to stories.  At this age, he is more interested in all kinds of communication.  He is eager to just <strong>tell you stories</strong> or describe things that happen.  You can see how much he enjoys your conversations. During this period, he will <strong>understand most of the things you say</strong> to him, and may be able to guess what some new words mean.  You will also notice that, by the end of this year, your child’s sentences will be longer.  He will also be able to follow more <strong>complex instructions </strong>with two or three parts, such as “Please close the door and come with me.”</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>As always, listen to your child and have enjoyable conversations at all times of the day.  You will find that at this age, your child has a lot to talk about!  Involve him in whatever you are doing and use this as an opportunity to playfully give him instructions or introduce interesting new words into the conversation.   Read and tell stories with your child every day.  You can ask him about the story—what does he think will happen next? </p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Feelings.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>The period from the third to the fourth birthday is very important for your child’s emotional development. During this period, he learns how <strong>to identify different emotions</strong>.  At this age, he may be able to recognize basic feelings such as happiness, sadness, fear and anger.  You might see him show some other emotions such as fear of imaginary things, concern or worry about how others behave, or love and attachment to people he feels close to.</p>

<p>If he has the opportunity you will see your child making his <strong>first friends</strong> during this year.  Now he will probably begin to <strong>play more cooperatively</strong> with others, in small groups.   Sharing is becoming easier—though not always—as he has some understanding of “mine” and “his.” </p>

<h3>               <strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Continue to create a secure environment for your child.  This makes it easier for him to express and regulate or control his feelings.  As when he was younger, predictable daily routines help create that sense of security.  Help your child know what happens next and what the typical pattern of the day will be.  If he feels safe, it will be.</p>

<p>Because these first friendships are important to your child, try to create opportunities for play with other children.  But stay close to the children, because the child’s social skills at this age are still not well developed, and misunderstandings or conflicts may happen.  You will help by reacting calmly and reasonably.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Thinking.  </strong></h2>

<h3><strong><em>What’s New?  </em></strong></h3>

<p>Play is still the dominant way in which a child of this age learns and explores himself and the world around him, but now your child’s “playful learning”  is becoming <strong>much more imaginative</strong>.  He might have a tea party or pretend to be a doctor with a sick baby.  Some children have imaginary friends at this age.  For the most part, although he loves to pretend, he knows what it real and what’s make-believe.  This is also a period of intense <strong>fascination with the world</strong> around your child.  <strong>Questions, questions, questions</strong> help him learn—who?  What?  why?  He is probably very interested in his own body and others’ bodies. </p>

<p>This year your child will also develop ideas about  opposites such as big / small, and more/less, as well as  other <strong>concepts</strong> such as “on”, “in,” and “below.”  His memory is developing, allowing him to  learn short songs and sing them later. He will also begin to point to and name <strong>some letters and numbers</strong>.   By his fourth birthday, he’ll probably count as many as four objects and group different objects by their similar color and shape.</p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Accept your child’s many questions as his important efforts to learn about the world.  Try to answer simply and honestly without giving too complex  explanations.  If you do not know something, say so.  Show your child ways to find out information—for example, if he asks about birds that he sees, you may find a book or talk with a neighbor who knows all about birds.  Always offer to find the answer together in books or other sources of information.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Moving.</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>What’s New?</strong></h3>

<p>Between the age of three and four, your child is <strong>very physically active</strong>.  You can see how much he enjoys all kinds of movements.  He has become better at running, climbing, jumping, and balancing on one leg.  He can catch a ball that’s bounced to him, most of the time.  If there are stairs in his environment, he’s better at going up them. </p>

<p>In other ways, your child is becoming <strong>more independent</strong>. He eats on his own, mostly is able to dress himself, uses the toilet independently, and washes himself. </p>

<h3><strong><em>And What Can You Do to Help?</em></strong></h3>

<p>Supervise and help with parts of his personal care that are still difficult, like brushing teeth.  Watch carefully as he climbs, allowing his independence but monitoring his safety.  Give your child the opportunity to try different kinds of activities – those with a lot of movement, and those that are calmer such as drawing and looking at books.  Teach your child traditional outdoor games; dance with him and copy his movements as he can copy yours.  Support activities that your child enjoys.</p>
